YOUR NOVEL TITLE

by Your Name</Text>
            <Notes>This is the title page of the manuscript. Note that “Compile As-Is” is ticked - this ensures that the title page’s formatting doesn’t get changed during the Compile process, even though the formatting of other text documents will be overridden to use a standard 12-point manuscript font.</Notes>

            <Title>Novel Format</Title>
            <Text>NOVEL WITH PARTS (STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT)

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels.

How To Use this Template
Edit the Title Page document to ensure it contains the correct information.
Create a new folder for each part of your novel at the same level as the Title Page document. Two folders have been created at that level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel. For instance, Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being’s first part is entitled “PART ONE: Lightness and Weight”. In that example, you would name the part, “Lightness and Weight” (the “Part One” will be added during Compile). You can choose not to include these titles during the Compile process.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) Some chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder.
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do - you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, select the sheet and then choose Documents &gt; Duplicate to create a new copy of the document which you can move to its intended location and fill in with your character or setting details.
Compile your manuscript into standard manuscript format by selecting File &gt; Compile.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Part subtitles: If you don’t want to include the titles of your “Part” folders in your compiled manuscript, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile sheet and deselect “Title” for the “Level 1” folder item. Then click on “Modify” and then “Title Settings” and remove the colon and space at the end of the title prefix (“Part &lt;$R&gt;”).
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile sheet and deselect “Title” for the “Level 2+” folder item and the “Level 1” and “Level 2” text items.
Page header: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile sheet. You will want to enter your name and the novel title in this field to replace the placeholder text there now.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used throughout the final document by selecting the document type rows and clicking the “Modify” button. This will display a sample preview of the text elements; click in the text to select it and then choose the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are contained directly inside the “Part” folders (that is, at the same level as the current “Chapter” folders).
Move the chapter folders to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile sheet, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.

Sample Document
See the “Sample MS” PDF file in the Research folder for an example of a document that has been created using this template.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Text>Chapter 1 – 

The summer sun was hot, baking everything, giving the shrubs a tired, slightly wilted look. Across the valley, the distant houses rippled as if they were under water, while the line of hills behind was just a shimmering blue blur.
Inside was cool and shaded. The balcony/veranda kept the sun from the windows, the solar block on the glass cut down the heat, while the airconditioning kept everything pleasant.
It was late January in Brisbane Australia, the hottest time of the year. Brisbane is semi tropical, meaning that summer is a lot drier than further north, where the tropics experience the wet season from November till March.
Nalini and I were sitting in our home office looking out across the shrubs to the valley. We were both feeling restless, thinking to take off to the beach rather than finish the project we were working on. The dog was happily asleep on her mat, one eye partly open, having decided that it was too hot to go outside and bark at strange noises.
Nalini Vaidya stands about five feet eight inches, and is of mixed indian asian extraction. Her skin is coffee colored, her black glossy hair hangs halfway down her back and her eyes are tawny yellow like a lioness. She has a gymnast's body. This particular day she had a large gold hoop in each ear, and was dressed in an emerald green blouse, black miniskirt and bare feet.
I am Danny Piekowski, I stand about five feet eleven, fairly muscular, with brown hair and blue eyes. I usually have a small gold loop in my left ear. Today I was dressed in dark blue slacks, pale blue shirt. My feet were bare as well, but we both had sandals by the door should we need them. We weren't expecting clients today though. Most of our client contact involve visits to their offices.
Nalini is my lover, partner, fiancee and best friend. (See &quot;We are such stuff as dreams are made of&quot; for details on how we first met.)
Nalini and i do most of our work from home, using our home office. We do a combination of technical writing and software development using the latest tools on PCs. We also have a girl friday called paula who handles the day to day running of things, as well as the contract book keeping, billing and word processing. When she's not there, or there's more work than she can handle, we have Liz, a temp who fills in. Almost all of the day to day clients are there to see Paula or Liz.
Our home office is downstairs, a large open area that is supposed to be the living/dining area. Sometimes we take a couple of portable PCs outside under the pergola. Across the corridor is the study, where Paula or Liz work. The study is smaller, but its door is closer to the front door than the office entrance. Since Liz usually fills in for paula, they share the desk. On the odd occasions when both of them have been there, we put one of them in the main office.
Also downstairs is the family room, kitchen and meals area, laundry, downstairs bathroom and toilet. Upstairs is the living room, with views across the valley, the main bathroom, and the bedrooms. One is for nalini and myself. The main guest room is occupied by Paula, along with her boyfriend prospero. (Refer to &quot;The Shadow of the Serpent&quot; for the background on Paula and Prospero). There are three other smaller bedrooms, one containing gym equipment, one junk, and the other empty. If guests do drop in, we've a couple of sofas that can be converted into double beds.
As I was saying, it was late January in Brisbane, about a three months after Paula, Nalini and myself had returned from tarantia. Imladril came to visit. Her arrival was a bit of a shock for liz, because imladril did not use the front door, but arrived in the corridor. The dog alerted us, bouncing out into the corridor to greet her. Liz looked up and there was imladril standing patting the dog.
Imladril is about four feet nine inches tall, brown skinned, but with blonde hair braided into over fifty braids, and each braid strung with beads. She was wearing a tartan skirt, green lace up bodice, and brown boots. Her eyes are disconcertingly green.
Liz was sitting at her desk, wearing a green miniskirt, a red top and no stockings. Like the rest of us she was barefoot, although a pair of black high heels sat in the corridor where she could put them on before answering the door. Her black hair was cut shoulder length, and caught at the back of her head in a small pony tail with a bright orange scrunchy. In her bare feet she stands almost five foot six, and she is a little on the solid side, but not plump. She is a murri aboriginal, so her skin is brown, as are her eyes.
Liz started, and exclaimed &quot;Who are you, and how did you get here?&quot;
Imladril replied calmly &quot;Sorry to startle you, child. My name is Imladril. I'm here to see danny or nalini.&quot;
Liz asked again &quot;But how did you get in here? I didn't see you go past me!&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;I walked. Like This.&quot;
Nalini and i came out to see what was happening. We arrived just in time to see imladril disappear, leaving a rainbow after image behind. Nalini complained &quot;Oh no, here we go again.&quot;
She was refering to an earlier incident in which imladril had done something similar when she had first met paula.
Liz's jaw dropped open and her eyes bugged out. &quot;Did you see...&quot; was as far as she got before imladril reappeared.
Liz stood there with a shocked expression on her face. I said &quot;Imladril, this is Liz, the temp who fills in when paula's not here. Liz, this is imladril. She has an unusual method of coming and going.&quot;
Liz was regaining her composure, no doubt because we seemed to know what was going on. &quot;Uh,.. its like something out of the x-files. How did you do that?&quot;
Imladril said &quot;Greetings liz. I did not mean to shock you, but i did not expect you to be here. Please do not worry, i am friendly. How i come and go is an application of natural powers. If you are interested, perhaps some time i will teach you how it is done.&quot;
Liz smiled uncertainly. &quot;Um... Thanks. I think i'd like to know a bit more before i say yes. Uh.. forgive me for asking, but you don't look like anyone else i've seen. Where abouts are you from?&quot;
Imladril smiled &quot;That would be better told over coffee. My eyes are naturally green, and my hair is naturally blonde. Right now i need to talk with danny and nalini, but i'll tell you about myself over coffee later.&quot;
Nalini and i went back into our shared office, accompanied by imladril, who shut the door. Imladril started without any preliminaries. &quot;I have some important news. Paula is pregnant. What are your thoughts on this?&quot;
I remarked &quot;Uh.. i thought she was on the pill.&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;She is. That is not important.&quot; She looked at me expectantly.
&quot;Well, she's already staying here. I don't think there'll be any problem if she wants to have a baby. I don't know how her parents are going to react. How about you nalini.&quot;
Nalini was looking thoughtful. &quot;Sure, she can continue to stay here. She's like family these days. She'll need money, but that won't be a problem, those gems we brought back from aquilonia are worth a fortune, even split into thirds. But i sense there is more to your question than this. I take it that prospero isn't the father? You can tell?&quot;
&quot;Yes, i can tell. If you cast your minds back to the time when you and danny were teaching her energy sharing...&quot; We did. Things had got out of hand, and the three of us had wound up making love.
Imladril continued &quot;That activation of energies over rode her contraceptive measures, and she became pregnant that night. However, because she has been spending time in shadows where time flows more slowly, she is not four months pregnant, but barely one month.&quot;
I could feel my face going red. I suspect my jaw dropped open as well. Nalini took hold of my hand and gave it a squeeze. I'm glad she did, because it took a weight off my mind.
Nalini sighed, and then remarked &quot;So that's the final outcome. I don't know whether to laugh or cry.&quot;
I commented &quot;I think i would prefer not to have known. It would be easier for all of us if we all thought it was prospero's kid. How's paula taking it?&quot;
Nalini added &quot;I agree with danny, imladril. I think i would rather not have known. Does paula know Danny's the father? I'm afraid she might try to come between danny and me, and just when i thought that all of that was dealt with.&quot; she made a face.
Imladril replied &quot;She came to me with her suspicions today, and i checked and confirmed to her that she is pregnant. I have not told her who the father is yet. I may not tell her, it might be kinder to let her think that prospero is. But i want you two to realise that you have a responsibility for her and her unborn child.&quot;
Nalini brightened perceptably and asked &quot;So how is paula taking it?&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;She is surprised, uncertain what to do, how her life is going to go. It is unexpected, because she has been taking precautions. She needs some reassurance, she will need some help. I would like you two to help her all you can, just as if she were your sister.&quot;
She sat back and smiled &quot;Well, that's all i wanted to say. I do not want paula to know we have had this conversation; but i would like you two to tell her that she has your support and love.&quot;
We both said yes.
Nalini remarked &quot;Well danny, i can't blame you for this, i was there, i know how it happened, i took part in it.&quot; She made a face, then suddenly she grinned &quot;So, you're going to be a father huh? And i'm going to be an auntie.&quot;
Thoughts were buzzing through my brain. Perhaps i was in shock. I must have looked glum, for imladril leaned forward and remarked &quot;Cheer up danny, a baby is supposed to be a joyous occasion. The events of life are only problems if you make them so. In our society a woman may have several children by different fathers, and a man may father children with different women. You may know I have sixteen children by nine different fathers.&quot;
Although imladril looks no more than eighteen or nineteen most of the time, she is from a long lived race, and is over eight hundred years old. Her youngest child, a girl, was a teenager and still living with her.
Nalini squeezed my hand again, and then i felt the touch of her mind, like a caress. The two of us are telepathic, although we don't always use it. Her thought came to me. &lt;&lt;Hey lover, we'll manage. We in this together, aren't we? Just don't you let it become an obstacle, because I won't.&gt;&gt;
I closed my eyes. &lt;&lt;Don't worry, i won't.&gt;&gt;. The caress of her mind grew stronger, and then we briefly linked in a wordless communication, now two halves of a greater whole. We stayed together for perhaps thirty seconds, then seperated. Now i felt light, happy, loved, and i knew nalini felt the same.
Imladril had sat quietly while this was happening, she was no doubt aware of what we were doing. The viharani are telepathic among themselves, and with some humans. She waited until we returned our attention to the room, then commented &quot;That's better. Now, how about coffee and something to eat? We should reassure that nice young girl outside.&quot;
The four of us went down the hall to the kitchen, where nalini put coffee on. It was nearly lunch time, so i opened a bottle of wine, and sat down to liz's right facing imladril. Nalini sat to my right, which is the custom amongst imladril's people - the woman sits to the right of the man.
Imladril remarked &quot;Danny is truly outnumbered today. Not only is he the only male here, he is also the only one with pale skin. I hope you do not feel too awkward today, danny!&quot; She spoke english with a slight accent.
Liz smiled and nodded at this. &quot;I don't think Danny minds too much.&quot;
I replied &quot;When we come to visit Imladril, i'm about the only one with pale skin in the whole village. It doesn't worry me. They accept me, I accept them.&quot;
&quot;Shall we have some food?&quot; Imladril spread her hands in a gesture, and suddenly the table filled with vegetarian delicacies. Liz looked at everything and shook her head. &quot;How did you do that? Is it real?&quot;
Imladril patted her hand and replied &quot;It is real food. I did not create it from nothing, i fetched it from elsewhere.&quot; She drank a swallow of wine, and then started explaining &quot;I am a real person, just like you are, except that i have learned skills that you have no words for. The closest words you have in english is magic or sorcery. I prefer to use the term sorcery, since magic is also the tricks that entertainers do before an audience. Can you accept that?&quot;
Liz replied &quot;Well, my people have shamans or sorcerers, and some of them are powerful, but they can't do something like that. At least i've never heard of anyone doning it.&quot;
Imladril looked surprised. &quot;I thought that sorcery was not practiced here. Who are your people?&quot;
Liz suddenly looked a little shy but responded &quot;I'm an aboriginal. I was born on stradbroke island. We still have sorcerers in our culture, although we don't call them that.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Her people were in this country before the white settlers came. They were mostly nomadic hunter gatherers. Many of them were killed or died of disease. They very nearly lost their cultural heritage.&quot;
&quot;They've only be regaining their heritage and their pride in the past twenty years or so.&quot; i added.
Imladril nodded. Liz was looking faintly astonished, as if she expected imladril to know the history of her people without being told. &quot;There's still a way to go before everyone accepts us. But my mob probably had it better than a lot of others. My brother's going to uni, I've been to college. How come you don't know about us?&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;You see liz, i do not live here. If i said that there are many earths, all seperated from one another like pages of a book, parallel worlds, would you know what i mean?&quot;
Liz looked thoughtful, but nodded &quot;I've heard about things like that. That's where things that disappear in the bermuda triangle are supposed to go. But i don't know much else about it. Unless you count 'Sliders' TV show. They go visit parallel earths.&quot;
Imladril smiled sweetly. &quot;We refer to them as shadows, which are cast by the source. There are an infinite number of shadows, each different. I can cross between these shadows at will. You people may even have stories about people who can cross to other realms. Humans here have stories of the realm of faerie, and a race called elves. They were just humans from another shadow, probably my own people, who could cross between shadows.&quot;
Liz raised her eyebrows. &quot;So you're an elf? I've heard about elves, never really believed they existed though. Our people don't have stories like that. We do have stories about spirit helpers, and there are a lot of stories from the dream time about powerful people and magical beings. But our people only talk about the spirit world and the real world. I don't know a lot about that, but only the stories my people told me.&quot;
Imladril nodded. &quot;We don't call ourselves elves, but viharani. There are a number of different races that can shift between shadows, I think humans have lumped all of them together as elves. I have taught danny and nalini some of my knowledge, and over time they will learn as much as they are capable of. I will tell you more if you like. But you must tell me about your people, for i know nothing of them.&quot;
We sat over lunch for almost two hours, finishing one bottle of wine and opening a second. Liz became a little giggly after her second glass, but she relaxed and talked about herself. All of us shared some of our personal history.
Nalini is from a diferent shadow herself. She had been taught the skill of shadow shifting almost fifteen years ago by a man called korum who was a powerful sorcerer from some distant shadow. She met me in dreaming almost two years before she met me in waking. I was taught many things during my dreaming sessions, and progressed to having complete lucidity in most dreams. Nalini arranged one night to meet me for lunch the following saturday. That same afternoon she started teaching me shadow shifting. We have been inseperable ever since.
In Imladril's shadow time runs almost four and a half times more slowly that it does here, so spending one day in her shadow results in about four and a half days passing here. As a consequence her birth coincides roughly with some of the egyption pyramids. She has been the ruler of her people for almost two hundred years.
When imladril left, liz said &quot;I don't know what to make of her. She seems nice enough, but i don't know if i want to become involved in sorcery.&quot;
Nalini smiled at her. &quot;Don't worry, now that you know, the choice will be up to you. You will have to accept that she can appear her when ever she wishes.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;Are you serious that you and danny can do that too? It's like something out of sliders isn't it?&quot;
Nalini raised an eyebrow. I shook my head. &quot;They seem to move just to the next closest shadow, with no control about where they go, and stay there for some time. We cross many shadows to reach a particular destination. We can make the same journey time and time again, and we don't need some gadget to do that either.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;We cannot shadowshift as well as imladril, but we are both fairly proficient at it. If you want to come along for a walk with us, just let us know.&quot;
Liz shook her head. &quot;I'm curious, but i don't know that i want to go any further.&quot;
&quot;Its not a problem. But i'm sure you know from your culture that magic and mystery are around us all the time, whether we choose to acknowledge it or not.&quot;
Liz nodded. &quot;I do know that, that's why i'm not sure about getting involved. Sorcery isn't something to play with, its deadly serious. But you fellas don't look like typical sorcerers, and you don't behave like them either.&quot;
I asked &quot;What does a typical sorcerer look like and behave like?&quot;
&quot;Oh, formidable old men and women. A bit scarey. They do strange things. I never thought of them as young. But you fellas are young, and so is imladril. I saw what she did, but i find it hard to believe she is really that old.&quot;
&quot;I find it hard to believe she's that old too. But danny and i are hoping we can live that long and look that good when we get there.&quot;
&quot;Is that possible? I mean, could you really plan on living eight hundred years?&quot;
Nalini shrugged &quot;I don't see any harm in trying. Its not as if we're hurting anyone.&quot;
&quot;So how old are you two?&quot;
I grinned &quot;How old do we look?&quot;
&quot;Well, you look about thirty, nalini looks a bit younger. Don't tell me your really hundreds of years old too.&quot;
&quot;Nah! We're both in our early thirties. No mystery there.&quot; i replied.
Liz smiled back. &quot;That's a relief actually. It'd be scarey if you were really old.&quot;
                                   ***
Imladril returned late that same day with paula. Paula is five feet nine or ten inches tall, very slim, with quite pale skin which she emphasizes with pale make up. Her hair is died black and cut in a page boy style, her eyes are green, and she wears multiple ear studs and nose stud. She has a penchant for bright red lipstick and matching nail varnish. Today she was wearing black shorts and matching t-shirt cut short to reveal her navel jewellery.
She was happy to see us, but didn't quite seem her usual self. We made coffee and sat in the lounge room. Imladril prompted paula with &quot;Paula has some news to tell you. Go on paula.&quot;
Paula looked suddenly nervous. &quot;Uh.. Yes... Well, guys, you see..&quot; She paused and took a deep breath. &quot;.. I'm pregnant!&quot; She stopped, maybe for dramatic effect.
Nalini said &quot;Really? When did this happen?&quot;
I said &quot;Well, congratulations! Or is it commiserations?&quot;
&quot;Don't joke, Danny! This is serious! Besides, you could be the father!&quot;
Oops! &quot;Umm, that was three or four months ago now. Its much more likely to be prospero isn't it?&quot;
Well, it may be three months ago here, but i've been keeping track of the days, and i'm only a couple of weeks late. But imladril confirmed that i'm pregnant. So it could be you or prospero.&quot;
Okay, play it straight. I said lightly &quot;Well, i guess you could have DNA tests done after the birth. If it turns out to be me you can sue me for paternity. Would you sue prospero if it turns out to be him?&quot;
She made a face. &quot;I hadn't thought that far. I wasn't going to sue anyone. But what am i going to do?&quot;
Nalini butted in. &quot;Paula, i want to say a few things. First, i don't care if its danny's or not, you're still welcome to stay here. But what i wanted to say is that you can stay here like you have been, we'll help you look after it. You won't have to sue danny for paternity or anything. You're family now, so we'll take care of you. Second, your share of the gems from aquilonia is worth quite a lot. I'm having them appraised, obviously they're worth more if they're sold in small lots. When we know what they are worth, we can give you your share, or we can sell small bundles and split that up. We can talk about that later, but you may not need to work.&quot;
Paula's eyes were gleaming. &quot;How much are they worth?&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;We've divided them into a number of small bundles, and I'm having each bundle appraised separately. I don't want anyone who does the appraisal to know that there are more than what's in the bundle they have. And I don't want you telling anyone about them either, because we don't want to attract thieves. There's one hundred and seventy bundles, only eleven have been valued so far. They ranged from fifty five thousand to two hundred and seventy five thousand. The eleven averaged one hundred and thirty seven thousand....&quot;
&quot;Wow! You mean we're rich? The whole lot must be worth millions!&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;We need to value them all so you are happy that you have a fair share. If the eleven are representative, the whole lot could be worth over twenty million. None of us need work again quite likely.&quot;
&quot;Oh... gosh! Umm... can I run around and scream?&quot; Paula got up and danced a little jig. She sat down again and remarked &quot;It kinda puts being pregnant into a new perspective, doesn't it? What am I going to do with all that money?&quot;
I chuckled &quot;Spend some of it, invest some of it. Work at things that make you happy. Of course, one reason for not selling them all here is that most of the gems will be valuable in almost any shadow. Just don't do anything rash or in a hurry. We'll keep our business going, but we may change focus, and ignore jobs that aren't interesting. You can keep working here for as long as you want.&quot;
&quot;Kewl!&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;Paula, i wouldn't mention to prospero that you suspect danny is the father. Does he know you're pregnant?&quot;
&quot;No, he doesn't know yet. But i don't know if i want to have a baby at all!&quot; Paula's excitement about money evaporated.
&quot;Well, if you don't want it, an abortion is easy to arrange.&quot; Nalini replied. Imladril looked surprised at this. Nalini continued &quot;We can make the arrangements, and pay the bill. I think it's only an overnight, or it may be only a few hours, i don't know. Who else knows you're pregnant?&quot;
&quot;No one else, just you three.&quot;
&quot;All right, then you could arrange to have an abortion and no one else would ever know.&quot; She leaned forward, took hold of paula's hand. &quot;Can i give you some advice?&quot;
Palua nodded. Nalini continued &quot;Abortion may seem the easy way out now, but if you do, i think you'll regret it later. My advice is to have the child, even if it does turn out to be danny's.&quot; She got up and came over to paula, putting her arm around her and giving her a hug. She thought to me &quot;Come on danny, you too.&quot;
Imladril moved, and i sat on paula's other side, putting my arm around her. She put her arms around both of us, and hugged back. &quot;Gee, thanks guys.&quot; She looked a little teary eyed.
I commented &quot;We'll manage paula. You'll be okay.&quot; After the hug, nalini and i moved back to our couch.
Imladril commented &quot;In my culture paula, there would be no question of having an abortion. Babies are always happy occasions. But there is also no stigma attached to having one out of wedlock, we don't have the concept of that. You're a grown woman, there's no problem about having a baby. In fact, the occurrences of life are only problems if we make them so.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;What will you tell prospero? He's going to realise you're pregnant soon. He'll probably want to do the right thing and marry you straight away.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, well, I like him a lot, but i don't know whether i want to marry him.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;Marrying because you're pregnant is a bad idea.&quot;
Paula responded &quot;But so's having a baby if i'm not married. What are my parents going to say?&quot;
Imladril said &quot;Paula, no one else needs to know for a while yet. I can perform something that will slow the growth rate down to perhaps one third, so it will take perhaps twenty five months to reach term. It will not harm the baby, but you will not show for another fifteen months. By that time you may well be married to prospero, and things can take their normal course with no social stigma. What is more, do not forget that you are spending time in shadows where time runs slower, so it could be much longer here before you start to show.&quot;
&quot;Hey, now that's great! I can just put it off for a time. I like that.&quot; Paula had brightened visibly now. &quot;I've already thought of the abortion angle, and i'd prefer not to have one. It's my baby, i don't want to kill it.&quot;
Imladril continued &quot;Now, prospero will suspect you are pregnant if you do not have a period soon, so i suggest that you pretend to have one each month for some time to come. Please do not feel forced into taking any action such as marrying him, though i also would suggest that you have the baby.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, well, i always thought i'd get married some day, and then have kids, in that order, but not for some time to come. I was thinking of maybe not having kids until I was in my thirties.&quot;
Imladril chuckled &quot;Paula, i've had sixteen children over the centuries. They can be bothersome at times, but they are also fun. Eventually they grow up and go on to lead lives of their own. Do not forget that you will live for a long time, and you will be young for most of that time. We will all help you.&quot;
Nalini almost had the last word &quot;Well there you go danny. You're going to be an uncle, and i'm going to be an auntie.&quot;
Paula nodded &quot;That's the best way to think of it isn't it? I don't want to spoil things between you and danny.&quot;
Nalini and i both shook our heads. &quot;You can't&quot; That was, still is, and always will be, the truth. Nalini and i are soulmates, real soulmates. No one can come between us.
Nalini continued &quot;But start thinking that danny is the father and that you should marry him will cause trouble between you and us.&quot; She said it lightly so as not to cause offence, and she smiled at paula.
I added &quot;Paula, we'll continue to treat you like a sister, but you gotta behave like a sister too.&quot; I was smiling.
Paula looked at the two of us for a moment, then smiled. &quot;Hey, I like being referred to as danny's sister. Don't worry nalini, you can trust me around danny, i'm not gonna go climbing into bed with him. Strictly platonic, sisterly.&quot; Then she looked a little puzzled. &quot;I really dunno what got into us that time.&quot;
&quot;I do.&quot; she smiled. &quot;You'd just had a close encounter with death, plus excitement, danger, adrenaline. It's a deep animal drive. Once danger is past, it often sparks sexual arousal.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;I was there with you, I started it, I encouraged you. I've said it before, we can't go around blaming anyone. It happened, we have to find a way of dealing with it so we can get on with our lives. But we don't think that a menage a trois is the right way to go about it.&quot;
Paula was shaking her head &quot;Uh... no, not really. I want to have a man of my own, not sharing someone else's.&quot;
Nalini leaned forward. &quot;It's all right paula, i trust you and danny together. And you have to admit it was fun at the time. We may do it again one day, who knows?&quot;
Paula suddenly giggled &quot;Yeah. It was, wasn't it? I'm glad you guys aren't mad at me about that, or that the baby might be danny's.&quot;
Imladril interrupted &quot;Paula, in my culture, the baby's father is known, but fatherhood does not give the father any rights over the mother, or the mother any rights over the father. However, the parents do have joint responsibilities for the baby. I am happy to see nalini and danny sharing responsibility for your baby. Prospero too if you do end up marrying him, but it would be a mistake to pressure him, because in his culture if he is the father then he has to marry you.&quot;
Paula was nodding &quot;I don't want to get married for some time, but i would prefer to be married before announcing I'm pregnant. So I'm happy for you to delay things for a couple of years.&quot;
Imladril frowned. &quot;I would prefer if we could simply announce your pregnancy, and have it be a joyous occasion. Your cultures are different from mine however, you three have to be happy with what ever you decide. The actual decision is not as important as taking responsibility for the decision, and being happy with the consequences.&quot;
Paula spread her hands. &quot;It's okay guys, I'm happy with what we've decided. I'm also happy to be treated like danny's sister, and I'll try to behave like one.&quot;
We talked things over some more after imladril left. It may seem surprising to you the reader, but since nalini and i can link into one another's mind, we know how we each feel about this. Paula is treated like family, but none of us are interested in a menage a trois. At the same time, while we were being secretive about paula's pregnancy, we did not intend that it remain that way. Once the child was born we would certainly let it know who its father was. We just didn't want prospero behaving inappropriately because of his cultural background. Our attitude probably says something about what we thought of his permanency.
Prospero was from a culture that was roughly similar to renaisance europe, though there were differences. His initial reactions when he came to our shadow were comical, and can be imagined. Paula liked to visit his shadow, but had no intention of living there. Prospero spent some time in paula's shadow, but preferred his own, where he was advisor to the king, and next in line to the throne unless the king had heirs. To make matters worse, his mother did not approve of paula because she did not come from a noble family.
                                    ***
The next morning, prospero and durathror arrived, riding horses. They let themselves into the backyard, where the dog raised a commotion. Prospero's horse was white, and heavily built for bearing a man in armor. Durathror's horse was lighter, longer of leg, and striped red and black like a tiger. This particular breed of horse was incredibly swift, and could easily outrun a cheetah.
Durathror is Imladril's eldest brother, or rather half brother, since they share the same mother but not the same father. Like her, his skin is brown, his eyes green, and his hair blond, and braided into some fifty braids, each covered with beads. He is clean shaven except for a droopy moustache, also blond. He stands about five feet two inches tall, and is fairly muscular for his size. Today he was wearing a red and green tartan kilt, a green and brown jerkin, and brown riding boots.
Prospero is about my height, slim and wiry. Like me his hair is brown and his eyes blue. He was dressed as a simple soldier in the king's guard, in baggy red trousers, sky blue jerkin, soft boots of brown leather, and a chain mail shirt made from ceramic links that nalini and i had fetched from some hi-tech shadow. His metal hat with linked plates that formed a neck protecter was tied to the saddle. He looked hot.
They unsaddled the horses and rubbed them down. Nalini and i brought out a tent like contraption intended for shading cars, and erected it to provide the horses with some shade. This wasn't the first time we'd had horses in the back yard. I also filled up an old baby's bath with water from the hose, running it for a while to get it cold.
Paula came running out in a t-shirt and panties, her hair wet, flinging herself into prospero's arms. They kissed, then she wrinkled her nose &quot;Ugh! You smell of sweat and horses!&quot;
He grinned &quot;We've been riding. I could do with a nice ... shower? I have not had a decent shower since I left here.&quot; His english was improving, but he still needed the translation spell.
Later, with everyone washed or showered, we sat down to a late breakfast. I had made a quick trip to the local bakery, and brought back crusty rolls, croissants, some pain chocolat, and a poppy seed scroll cake. Nalini and paula had already set out jams, honey, cheeses, some sliced meats and assorted pickles plus a bowl of fruit and another one of tomatoes.
Prospero sat down looking pleased with himself. &quot;This conditioned air is wonderful in the heat!&quot; He spooned several sugars into his coffee - he likes it sweet and black. &quot;It still amazes me how cheap good coffee is in your shadow. I have a mind to set up a business to export your coffee to Tarantia. There it literally sells for its weight in gold!&quot;
&quot;You could halve the price and still make a fortune.&quot; I commented.
Prospero nodded. &quot;Each time i come here i must purchase more coffee than last time, because the nobles and wealthy merchants want to taste it, and then they want some for themselves.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Why not take back a box of the grinders, pots for cooking it, maybe even several different varieties of coffee? There must be other things you can try too, like spices and so on.&quot;
Prospero picked up one of the pain chocolats. &quot;This is another item that we cannot buy back in tarantia, but there would be no point in importing this. It must be something light, valuable, and that can stay fresh for months. Spices is a good suggestion nalini. I should have thought of that myself.&quot; He began munching contentedly on the pain chocolat, washing it down with swigs of coffee.
Paula cut a croissant in half, layered sliced meat, cheese and tomatoes onto it. &quot;You really enjoy your food don't you? I'd rather stick with savory stuff. That chocolate bread is too sweet for me.&quot; She sprinkled pepper over the tomato, put the other half of the croissant on top, and bit into it. &quot;Now this is yummy!&quot;
Durathror looked around the provendor, and decided to copy paula. &quot;I don't usually eat flesh, but since it it here, and no one will be offended, I will try what you are having.&quot;
Nalini and i don't like the burned butter taste of croissants, so we tend to stay with the crusty bread. I put cheese, vegemite and tomato on one. Prospero watched me spread the black vegemite paste and commented &quot;I don't know what you people see in that. It's too salty for my taste.&quot;
&quot;It's probably the only thing here that could be called Australian.&quot; I chuckled. &quot;I don't think anyone else eats the stuff, even nalini doesn't like it.&quot;
&quot;No, I prefer peanut paste.&quot; said she, spreading some on half a bread roll.
&quot;What is vegemite?&quot; Durathror asked.
&quot;Hey! I like it too!&quot; Paula interrupted, mouth full. &quot;It's a savory yeast paste. Try it.&quot;
I added &quot;Vegemite is a brand name, there are other similar ones like Marmite, Promite and so on. They're made from yeast, so they're a good source of B vitamins. Different brands have different amounts of sugar and salt, but this is one food that is made only in Australia.&quot;
Nalini chuckled &quot;Yes, everyone else has better sense!&quot;
Prospero went to the frig, came back with a jar of anchovies and another one of black olives, along with a couple of cloves of garlic. &quot;I'm glad you buy the greek kalamata ones, the spanish olives are too oily.&quot;
He sat down again, appropriated a bread roll. &quot;I know we need extra salt in summer. This is how I like to do it!&quot; He chopped a clove of garlic and spread it over half of the bread roll. Then he fished out several anchovies and laid them on top, drizzling the oil around. Finally he sliced five or six black olives and spread them on top. &quot;This is similar to what the peasants around my estates do.&quot;
Paula made a face. &quot;Ugh! And you say vegemite is too salty! I hope you don't expect me to kiss you after eating that!&quot;
Aggrieved, he complained &quot;Hey yourself! You eat raw onions!&quot; He took a bite, munched, then commented &quot;What this really needs is some robust wine to wash it down with.&quot;
&quot;For breakfast?&quot; paula exclaimed.
Durathror said simply &quot;I would like some wine too.&quot;
I stood up. &quot;Okay prospero, you can help me select one.&quot;
He followed me into the storage area of the garage, when I keep most of the wine. We selected a two liter flask of chianti and returned. I had barely opened it when liz arrived for work. We invited her to join us.
&quot;Phew! It's such a relief to get into the air conditioning!&quot; She kicked her shoes off in the corridor. &quot;Be with you in a minute&quot; She headed into the downstairs bathroom and returned a few minutes later, giving us time to set a sixth place at the table between durathror and prospero.
Breakfast ended up being a leisurely affair. Durathror headed off afterwards, taking prospero's horse with him, and promising to return in two weeks to take prospero home. He also promised to bring several pack horses for any goods prospero decided to import.
No one really felt like working after that, but there were invoices to get out for clients, plus some word processing. Paula and liz both worked on that, allowing us to be finished before lunch. Nalini and i delivered the urgent work and posted the invoices while the girls finished stuff that was required tomorrow morning.
I then drove liz home so she could collect her swimming costume and change into something more suitable for the beach. I specifically asked her to dress for walking, and take a bag she could sling on her back. She was excited about the prospect of collecting a day's pay while spending time at the beach. She emerged wearing denim shorts, sand shoes with no socks, t-shirt with a picture of leaping dolphins on it, and carrying her beach bag.
The others were all ready and waiting when we returned. Nalini had packed a light back pack for me as well.
&quot;Where are we going? Danny's been hinting about somewhere good, but he won't let on. I practically lived on the beach at Straddie when I was a kid. It's a pity Brizzie doesn't have beaches as good.&quot;
Brisbane's beaches tend to be a bit muddy because of the mud in the Brisbane, Logan and Southport rivers that run into Morton Bay. Stradbroke and Morton Bay islands separate the bay from the Coral Sea, they have clean white sandy beaches, but can only be reached by ferry from Cleveland, a journey that takes about an hour. Other good beaches are the surf beaches of the Gold Coast to the south, and the Sunshine Coast to the north. The Gold Coast is an hour's drive, while the Sunshine Coast is an hour and a half drive. In January they are crowded with holiday makers from colder climates along with day trippers from Brisbane.
Nalini smiled. &quot;Well, we know a lovely resort beach about twenty minutes walk through shadow from here. Paula and Prospero have been there before, though I'm not sure if either of them could find there way back yet.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;Oh... it won't hurt will it?&quot;
Prospero shook his head &quot;No, it doesn't hurt a bit. But I have trouble enough shifting through five shadows and back again. If you trust me you could wind up anywhere at all, maybe even the moon!&quot;
Paula commented thoughtfully &quot;I can think of three beaches we've been to. I'm not sure if I could find my way there though.&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;All right, you're off the hook for now, but I think it would be good if you had some practice on the way home.&quot; She turned to Liz. &quot;Basically, there's nothing to it. You just stay with the rest of us. The scenery will change around us as we walk. Explanations won't mean much to you until you have the basic skills, so just watch and enjoy.&quot;
We shouldered out packs and walked into the back yard. Nalini locked up while i put the dog onto a leash. She went from sound asleep to bouncing with excitement in zero flat as soon as I rattled the chain of the leash.
Nalini began explaining to liz as we walked through the gate. &quot;Movement seems to be an integral part of shifting. Korum, the person who taught me fifteen years ago, claimed that movement wasn't necessary, but we've all found that we can't shift unless we are moving. It's as if open a doorway to another shadow, and we have to move forward to go through the door.&quot;
I added &quot;You may not understand all this right now liz, but just listen to what we say, understand what you can. Right now nalini and i have opened up our perceptions to the other shadows, and we are surrounded by impressions of possibly hundreds of adjacent shadows.&quot;
&quot;Um... so what do they look like?&quot;
&quot;Well, it's like when you can see things in your mind's eye. They aren't ghostly overlays or anything, they're quite separate.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Many of them are very similar to our own. For example, do you see that flowering bush over there? There is another shadow where there is a bush in a similar place, but the flowers are red instead of yellow....&quot;
External reality shimmered briefly, and the bush had red flowers. The street seemed much the same, although the houses were slightly different designs.
&quot;Oh!&quot; Liz exclaimed. &quot;How did you do that?&quot;
The rest of us were grinning. Nalini replied &quot;That will have to wait until you have had some basic training. Let's just say I selected the shadow we were talking about, and moved us into it.&quot;
Liz stopped, was looking around. The dog was straining against the leash, wanting us to continue. &quot;So this is a real parallel world? Just like ours, only different?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, they probably even speak english with an Australian accent.&quot; I replied.
&quot;You don't know for sure?&quot;
I shook my head. &quot;There are an infinite number of shadows. We sometimes go exploring to discover new places, but normally we just pass through on our way to somewhere else. I'm often curious about shadows we pass through, but most of them we never find anything about, and we may never pass through again.&quot;
&quot;How do you mean that?&quot;
Paula jumped in. &quot;Hey I can answer that one. All of the shadows move in different directions. So a shadow that is near right now may not be reachable in five minutes. In fact, I can't seem to see our home shadow now.&quot;
&quot;It's still there.&quot; nalini answered. &quot;But it is moving away. As danny said, we don't normally explore randomly. We can move into any adjacent shadow and start looking around, like right now. There may be good beaches here, but we don't know, and it will take some time to find out. Let's start walking again.&quot;
Reality swirled again, and we were back in our own street. &quot;This one looks familiar.&quot; liz remarked.
&quot;This is ours.&quot; nalini replied. &quot;We can discover new places by exploring, but to goto a specific destination we need to be able to visualize it. That works best if we've actually been there, or visited in in dreaming. Danny and i have experimented with photos, but we often get somewhere similar, but not quite the same - like that shadow we just stopped in.&quot;
We were walking down the street. I switched us to a shadow where the street was narrower, the houses single story. Across the valley there were no houses, only trees and scrub, plus power pylons running off into the distance.
&quot;Thanks danny. It's hard to talk and shift at the same time.&quot; She continued her explanations to liz. &quot;What we're doing is visualizing our destination. That gives us a sense of direction, and distance.&quot;
We continued down the road toward the park. A couple of kids on skate boards zoomed past, baseball caps on backwards. I shifted again, and we were walking along a dirt track between farms, under a lemon yellow sky. The distant hills and valley had vanished, but off to the left were several truncated volcanic cones like the stumps of broken teeth. If anything, it was hotter here.
Nalini continued &quot;As far as we know, there are two methods for navigating through shadows. Korum, the man who taught me, spoke of adding and subtracting features, gradually changing shadows until he reached his destination. That would mean many small changes like the first shift. We find that difficult because many more shifts are required.&quot;
I shifted us again, seeking somewhere cooler. The sky switched to pale pink with delicate orange clouds dotted here and there. We were walking across a dusty red plain. The soil was rust red, the sparse vegetation had broad flat reddish brown leaves. Low trees with gnarled black trunks and blood red spikey leaves grew in a clump near by. Our track was no more than a goat trail. It was cooler now, but still warm.
&quot;We find it easier to select shadows more or less on a direct line with our destination. This is what danny is doing at present. It can mean very abrupt shifts, but there are less of them.&quot;
Liz interrupted &quot;This is going way over my head you know.&quot;
&quot;All right, just enjoy the walk then.&quot;
I was trying for a straight line to our destination, but not all shadows are safe. It is possible to sense danger before shifting in, so I was testing for danger, and then avoiding shadows that hinted at danger. Sometimes dangers were things like wild beasts, wars, pits of molten lava, mine fields and the like, but more often they were unknown dangers from strange shadows. They could vary from poisonous atmosphere, no atmosphere or crushing pressure, extreme heat like venus, or just wierd shadows where the rules of physics were sufficiently different that the processes necessary to sustain life could not occur. There are a large number of those weird shadows, quite possibly more than inhabitable ones.
Korum's method of shifting tended to avoid strange shadows and most of the dangers, but he could also shift several times a second. We could not. Normally nalini and i take about a minute to set up the next shift; we can shift faster in life threatening situations, but it tires us rapidly and puts us at risk of running into random dangers.
My next shift was to a similar terain, except the vegetation was bluish grass. In the distance giraffe like creatures pruned some of the taller trees. The horizon was a huge snow capped mountain range that ringed us and glinted redly in the sun.
Liz stopped &quot;Hey! I should've brought my camera! This is spectacular!&quot;
I think the rest of us grinned - we've all had that reaction. Nalini rummaged in my pack, brought out our camera and  handed it to liz. &quot;We always carry one with us, we often photograph shadows of interest so we can remember them more easily. I guess danny and i are a little blase about things now, but take all the photos you want.&quot;
Prospero took out a pair of high powered binoculars. &quot;I know there is a lot of fantastic technology in your home shadow, but to me something as simple as a pair of binoculars is perhaps the most impressive.&quot; He was looking in the direction of the giraffe like creatures as he spoke. &quot;Those creatures are magnificent. They resemble giraffes, but their necks are more sinuous like snakes. Their markings are odd too.&quot;
Prospero handed the binoculars to paula, and took out his own camera. His was more expensive than ours, and came complete with a set of telephoto lenses. He wasn't a real camera buff - he tended to forget he was carrying it unless someone reminded him. But he had learned what was good, and knew a lot about how to use it.
We took some photos, including holiday snaps of liz, and then continued. While I was trying for a reasonably direct route, I was also trying for more interesting shadows.
Our next shift took us to a wide rocky ledge above clouds. There was almost no wind, but the breeze was quite chilly. The rock itself was dark blue black, the sky deep violet. Small spectacularly orange shrubs grew from little crannies in the cliff. The sun was not visible, but we looked out across the tops of creamy lavender clouds. There was a scent of rose petals in the air.
Paula and prospero both complained that they could not detect the shadows nalini and i were choosing from.
Nalini replied &quot;You're both fledgeling shadowshifters, it will take some time before you are proficient. Your powers will grow, and you will be able to detect more shadows.&quot;
For our next shift nalini and i debated several choices. We selected something a little different, but weren't aware of some of the differences.
We stepped into a huge enclosed area with a swimming pool. The first thing we noted was that the air pressure was less, causing our ears to pop; the second thing was that the gravity was also a lot less,maybe two thirds of earth normal. That made walking a little difficult, since the forward motion in walking and running is achieved by leaning forward in and letting gravity pull your feet back to the ground. In a lower gravity that takes longer than you anticipate, plus you tend to spring into the air which compounds the problem.
&quot;Wow!&quot; from paula.
&quot;Jeez!&quot; from liz.
We all stopped.
The floor was tiled in what looked like pink quarry tiles with a roughened surface that would be non slip when wet. The room was huge, accomodating an olympic size swimming pool, deck chairs, tables and some tiered seating. The people were human, but quite tall and thin with very large chests, mostly naked, a mixture of skin colors. The far wall and roof were transparent, huge panes of glass hung from girders. The roof was probably ten meters or higher. Through the glass we could see a martian like landscape, all harsh red rocks, and in the distance a high red cliff. The sky was a deep pink, shading into indigo toward the zenith.
&quot;This is incedible! We can't still be onearth can we?&quot;
&quot;I'm not sure liz, we'd have to stop and ask people questions to find that sort of information out...&quot;
&quot;Speaking of which&quot; nalini interrupted &quot;I'd like to come back here some other day. I'll take some photos.&quot;
&quot;Good idea. As i was saying, we'd have to stop, and often that can cause problems. We stand out as strangers, so they may be suspicious of us.&quot;
&quot;Also, this is higher tech than home, that can cause problems.&quot; nalini added. &quot;Often we need ids but can't get them, the money is all electronic, and we can't do that without ids; there's a whole raft of problems. Danny and I will come back and look around in dreaming first, find out a few things, determine if it is a good place to stop.&quot;
&quot;That's something else I have to ask about. Visiting in dreaming. You say that like dreams are real.&quot;
&quot;They can be. Everyone has three bodies, the physical, the dreaming, and the spiritual. The dreaming body doesn't always coincide, especially when we're asleep. Dreams are the garbled recollections of the dreaming body. If you start learning sorcery, this is where you start. You have to bring your waking consciousness into your dreaming body, and then you can direct where it goes, and you can recall what it has experienced and make sense of that. Your dreams change from ordinary dreams to lucid dreaming, or dreaming for short. You must know something about that, your people have their stories of the dreamtime, they have reasons why they call it the dreamtime.&quot;
&quot;Hmmm. I don't think that was part of it. But I would have to ask the elders, they're the keepers of the dreamtime stories.&quot; Suddenly she pointed with her head. &quot;Hey! Are those people over there having sex?&quot;
I looked in the direction she indicated, and spied a tangle of male and female bodies seeming intent on giving and receiving sexual pleasure. There were some distance away, but still in full public view.
&quot;Looks like it. This could be a very interesting shadow.&quot;
&quot;Hey prospero&quot; came paula's voice &quot;I hope you're not planning on using those binoculars to perve?&quot;
&quot;It was not my intention to look at them. I want to study the cliffs out there.&quot;
People were looking at us, but no one approached. I guess we looked different enough to attract attention. &quot;Let's keep moving, and surprise all the onlookers.&quot;
We started walking toward the pool, faded out after five steps, leaving a rainbow after image. I don't know what the onlookers thought. Maybe we made the local headlines.
The next shadow was even stranger. The sky was black, but a huge green globe hung there, looking like a planet with clouds. Swirling shades of green that gave reflected light many more times brighter than that of a full moon. The ground was tesselated with black and white tiles, each one about a meter square. The gravity was slightly heavier, but still much less than earth. In the distance were blocky structures reminiscent of city buildings, some black and white, others tesselated silver and gold, and still others green mother of pearl. There were creatures moving around the buildings, odd looking creatures that looked like boxy replica insects constructed from a child's leggo set. It was hard to gauge the scale though.
We walked slowly. When travelling through shadows, what determines your speed is how often you shift, not how fast you travel within a shadow. A particular destination may be twenty or thirty shifts away, the exact number will change with time as the shadows twist and dance around each other; traveling fast within a shadow will have little effect on the number of shifts required unless you happen to luck on a position that is closer or more distant. While we can detect shadows around where we happen to be, we cannot detect locations where they converge on the current shadow.
Another twelve steps and we shifted to a green world. The sky was green, the hot sun eye seering green, the broad leafed foliage brilliant green. We were walking across short emerald green grasses in a clearing beside a stream. Even the rocks were covered with green furry growths. Brightly colored birds flitted through the trees. The jungle was filled with strange sounds - grunts, coughs, screeches, and other noises less identifiable. Heady floral scents drifted on the breeze. Air pressure and gravity close to earth normal.
We walked by the stream for a minute or so, almost reaching the edge of the clearing. Then we were walking over a wooden walkway extending out from the steep sides of an extinct volcano. The path wound around several other steep sided cones. A dark blue ocean washed directly onto the bases of the volcanoes, splashing us from time to time. The slopes were mostly hard igneous rock, but crevices collected soil, from which sprouted fleshy leaved plants like pigface, with small pink and blue flowers. White seabirds hovered overhead screaming into the ocean wind. The sky was the color of fresh cream with pale yellow clouds scudding by.
The next shift took us somewhere colder. Now we walked along a cliff top overlooking a dark sea to our right that washed onto black sand or pebbles. The sky was deep rust red, the sun a dull yellow orb. Grey clouds were piling up out to sea, promise of a storm to come. We walked on low tufted brown grasses, further back the scrub grew leaning away from the sea, evidence of the power of the wind. Even the gnarled spiny leaved trees grew lopsidedly. The coast curved round to a point, along that distant curve we could see white buildings with black roofs.
Another shift, to grey skies with some blue. We walked along a stone quay beside a broad brown river. Cool, but not too cold. To our left a cobbled street and stone buildings with a georgean look. They seemed strangely familiar. Modern looking cars in the street. Ahead a low stone bridge and on the other side a tall metal tower we all recognized. People in light modern clothing walking around.
&quot;Hey! Is this Paris? That looks like the Eiffel Tower over there!&quot;
&quot;Or one of its analogues. There are any number of shadow Parises. Nalini and i have visited several.&quot;
&quot;Hey, i don't care. I gotta get me some pictures!&quot;
We took some photos, then walked along the banks of the seine for a while. Liz was excited, wanting to stay here.
Nalini commented &quot;Liz, enjoy the walk, but if you want to explore one of the Paris shadows, you'd best set aside a few days and make a special trip. We'll take you one day, or you can learn shadow shifting and take yourself.&quot;
&quot;You're tempting me into learning you know!&quot;
&quot;That might just be part of the idea.&quot; nalini grinned.
I shifted us just before we reached the bridge, and now it was night. We walked over sand, and directly ahead was the Eiffel tower lit up like a christmas tree. Fountains sprayed in the play of colored lights, and tourists of all types wandered around.
Another shift and we walked a trackless wilderness. All around us was a martian landscape of weathered orange rocks and tall hills. These were banded with different colors of orange and red, showing that they were once part of the sea floor. The sky was a deep violet, clear of clouds. Behind us was a small bluish sun. It was hot here.
The next shift brought us to the side of a hill, on dew drenched green grass. We looked out across grey fog to the black silhouettes of distant pine trees. It was predawn light, we stopped to watch as the sky shaded from brown through brilliant reds, yellows to green. An orange ball peeped over the horizon, turning the fog the color of orange juice. Liz took more photos, then we continued.
&quot;That sun rise was magnificent!&quot; Liz exclaimed.
&quot;Yes, often when we are out shadow shifting we stop here and there along the way to admire the view or smell the roses. There is so much to see, and every shadow is different.&quot; nalini replied.
Nalini shifted us to a warmer shadow. We walked along the red sand of a sea shore, leaving our footprints in the otherwise virginal sand. To our left sand dunes stretched away, covered with coarse yellow grasses. Dark sedimentary rocks dotted the shore line, the sea was smooth as glass. Overhead the sky was pale orange, while fluffy white clouds drifted by. The sun was lime green, making all of us look billious. In the distance we could see something darker bobbing on the sea.
Prospero peered through his binoculars. &quot;It looks like three natives in a dugout canoe. They seem to be fishing with spears.&quot; He handed the binoculars around; we all took a look.
&quot;It's peaceful here. How much further dowe have to go?&quot;
&quot;Only another five or six shifts, Liz. I don't know about you, but I'm working up an appetite.&quot;
Liz giggled &quot;I'm always hungry! That's why I'm overweight.&quot;
What would people make of footprints that started in the middle of the shore, walked about thirty meters, and vanished again? Mark it as one of life's little mysteries, or file it under X for X-files?
The next shadow wasn't as welcoming. A blood red sky, under a blood red sun. A few small blue grey clouds scudding by. A landscape of harsh black basalt, with some scruffy dark shrubs growing here and there. Further off a small village. In the distance snow capped peaks glinting as if bloodstained.
Through prospero's binoculars the village looked like wattle and daub with thatch roofs. Unkempt looking people in skins walked around, women bare breasted, the men carrying spears or clubs. Some of the women were butchering a kill, a large four legged animal. There was no head visible, but it might have been a bear or similar - its legs were thick and clawed rather than thin and hoofed.
We shifted again to another rocky sea shore, this time with pale orange sand and gravel, and some larger dark rocks. The ocean was to our left this time, the waves rolled onto the shore with resounding crashes. Further around the rocks clumped together, and people had build a lighthouse there. Back from that was a parking lot with some older looking cars parked. The styles reminded me of the 1940s. There were some people wandering between the light house complex and the car park, they seemed to have a bluish tinge to their pale skins. Most were dressed in baggy white pantaloons and long jerkins. Males seemed to wear dark red turbans on their heads, females wore long blue waistcoats and tied their hair into braids, colied on either side of their heads. The sky was completely covered with grey clouds, we could not see the sun or the sky.
The next shift took us away from the sea, to a ruined city under a dark purple sky. Some walls still stood here and there, but most looked as if they had been pushed over. Red vegetation partly covered many of the fallen stones. A double row of broken columns lined a paved street, reddish grasses growing between the light grey stones. Further up the hill was a broad staircase that lead nowhere now. We walked past the columns and followed the paved road until we shifted again.
Back to civilization again. We were walking across a bridge over a broad brown river. The bridge may have spanned one hundred and fifty to about two hundred meters. There was a raised footpath on either side, stone balustrading on the river side, and four lanes of black top for cars. The cars were big, with 1950s style fins and lots of chrome, and drove on the left, European or American style. The sky was pale green. Most of the people were asiatic looking, the women wearing cheong sams, the men mao style suits. Quite a few of them looked at us as we walked by.
The next shift was to a shadow with a yellow sky. Furnace like heat blasted us, the sun stood high in the sky like a baleful blue eye. A dark green sea stretched out to our left, washing against salt encrusted rocks. The shore was rocky, and fairly flat, extending away to our right to a distant escarpment. In the distance some brown shapes moved, too distant to make out.
We shifted again, walking out on rust red sand under a lavender sky. The beach extended along the shore for several hundred meters at least with a rocky promontory at either end. Groups of people were dotted along the shore, some lying on colorful beach towels, some sitting in deck chairs, some just walking. Others were swimming around in the calm green water. Back from the beach was a small rise covered in palm trees. Behind them stretched an unbroken line of holiday apartments, rising six storeys only. Behind them tall peaks rose into the sky, the distant ones tall enough to be snow capped.
&quot;We're here.&quot; nalini announced.
&quot;Hey! This is great!&quot; Liz exclaimed.
&quot;In amongst the palm trees is a board walk running the length of the beach, and behind that is shops and sidewalk cafes.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;This is an island something like hawaii, but the peaks are taller. There is permanent snow cover up there, and a ski resort tucked between those two peaks over there.&quot; she pointed.
Prospero remarked &quot;I have been here once I think, but I could not have found my way here.&quot;
Paula commented &quot;I think I might have been able to find this place, but it would have taken more shifts, I couldn't see any of those shadows you were shifting into.&quot;
&quot;That all comes with practice. Liz, the most important techniques of visualization and selecting shadows have to be learned in dreaming first, because our dreaming body can already slip through shadows.&quot; I commented. &quot;I don't know if you have ever had a dream of visiting some familiar place, only to find it isn't completely familiar?&quot;
She nodded. &quot;That happens from time to time. It looks like a place I know, but something is different.&quot;
&quot;Exactly. That is a different shadow, an analogue of our own. Just like we went through two different copies of Paris today. Anyway, before we go and get some food, we might all like to go for a dip.&quot;
Liz dropped her shorts and removed her t-shirt to reveal a red one piece. &quot;I can see the dog wants to as well. Let her off the leash. C'mon!&quot;
I let the dog off, and the two of them charged into the water. The rest of us had to find change rooms first, and lockers in which to stow our belongings. Then we joined liz in the water. Paula and nalini went topless, as is the fashion here.
It didn't take liz long to realise she was the odd one out in her one piece. Nalini promised &quot;After lunch we'll go shopping and buy you one.&quot;
&quot;You don't need to do that. I can buy my own.&quot;
Nalini smiled. &quot;Except that your money isn't any good here.&quot; Neither was ours for that matter, but nalini and i could change the notes and coins into something acceptable here with a little bit of sorcery. &quot;Liz, time to stop thinking of yourself as an employee now. You're part of our extended family, otherwise you wouldn't be here in the first place.&quot;
Later we showered and dressed and went looking for lunch. Liz kept pointing out dogs sitting or lying by tables we passed.
&quot;That's okay liz, dogs are allowed in restaurants here, as long as they are on leashes.&quot;
There were many different restaurants and cafes on the sidewalk. Prospero declared &quot;We have to keep coming here until I have eaten every dish in every restaurant! It is truly amazing the variety of food here.&quot;
Nalini laughed &quot;That'll test you, prospero. There must be hundreds of restaurants here, I'm sure some of them will close down before you ever get to them!&quot;
&quot;Maybe so, but I can try! This is a food connoisseur's idea of paradise!&quot;
The place at which we ate even had thirty seven varieties of beer. Prospero complained &quot;I despair of trying them all, but perhaps I can sample several with danny while you girls go shopping afterwards?&quot;
All of us sampled different beers during lunch, which meant two of the girls were a little giggly by the time they went shopping. Nalini has had more practice, and doesn't get tipsy easily.
Nalini commented to liz and paula as they walked off &quot;Poor danny, he was so hoping to watch us try on swimsuits.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;You don't mind him looking at other girls' tits?&quot;
&quot;No. We like guys to admire our tits, why can't he admire any girl's tits? Besides, he may look around, but his eyes always come back to me.&quot; The rest of the conversation faded out.
They returned an hour later, and we all changed back into swimsuits. Liz came over to where prospero and i were waiting, and paraded. &quot;Nalini says it's okay for you two to admire.&quot;
Prospero looked, nodded. &quot;Nice pair. Nice orange swim suit too.&quot;
I had to laugh, because he was obviously wanting to look without letting paula see him staring. &quot;You look good liz. C cup?&quot; Liz nodded.
Paula paraded up. &quot;Okay guys, you can admire me too.&quot;
&quot;Paula, you're always fishing for compliments. You know you look good, you know we watch you.&quot;
We spent most of the afternoon in the water, ate a huge dinner, then walked around the shops for a while before heading back home. Paula was a little tipsy so nalini and i did the shifting. The proviso about not drinking and driving also applies to shadow shifting.
We arrived home after ten, where upon nalini and i drove liz home. &quot;That was a really great day. Thank you. Can we do it again?&quot;
&quot;Of course&quot; we both assented. &quot;Why not bring your walking gear, swimwear and maybe some sports clothes over to our place and leave them there? That way we won't have to keep driving you home to pick it up. As long as the day's work gets done we're more than happy to take off for the rest of the day. We'll go to different places too, and visit some of the more interesting shadows we pass through.&quot;
&quot;That's great, thanks! Mind you, I'm not likely to wear a topless bikini anywhere around here, am i? Hey, what do I tell my folks?&quot;
&quot;Just tell them you went down the gold coast with us, and you'll be going regularly. All you have to do is phone them when you're going so they will know you'll be home late.&quot;
As it was all her family were sitting out the front in the cooler evening air when we arrived, and we were invited for a drink. It was just as well we all had the story straightened out before hand.
                                ***
Thereafter we made similar trips most days. Liz decided she liked the idea enough to contemplate learning how to shadowshift. That entailed dreaming practice. We managed to find liz in dreaming, but she continually became distracted by her surroundings, as dreamers usually do. She also had trouble remembering her dreams. For the time being it came down to practice and perseverence. If she showed enough aptitude, Imladril would provide her with a torc that would boost her energies, and make subsequent learning much easier.
That could take time. In my own case, nalini was teaching me in dreaming for almost two years before I was given my torc. This was longer than usual, but then I had no contact with nalini outside dreaming during that time.
We also gave Liz a series of energy exercises, some passive like meditation, some active body movements; some best done alone, some to be done with nalini and myself.
Prospero spent some of his time buying coffee, some spices and baking powder (the ingredient that makes self raising flour rise). He had watched nalini and i bake cakes, and remarked &quot;To me it is amazing that you can put the batter in to the oven as soon as it is mixed. We still use yeast based baking. A pastry chef must wait several hours for the batter to rise before it can be baked. This powder will revolutionize baking in my shadow!&quot;
&quot;We know. It's had that effect in ours. Most baking here doesn't use yeast now.&quot;
He grinned. &quot;Yes, I have now had some experience with cakes and pastries in your shadow. They are far superior to the creations in my shadow. But this will change!&quot; His eyes were flashing with excitement - talking about food does that to him. We wished him success.
About two weeks later Durathror turned up with prospero's horse and two pack animals. He took one look at the amount of baggage prospero wanted to take, and shook his head. &quot;We will need more animals.&quot;
Paula butted in with &quot;Hey Durathror, can you get a horse for me to please? I'm going back with prospero.&quot;
Durathror stayed with us, some three hours later his wife Ra'anor arrived with three more pack animals and a horse for paula. Ra'anor is from a different people, her skin is pale, her hair red, though braided similarly to durathror's. She wore a green kilt, soft brown riding boots and a green jerkin. Her face has a large tattoo of a spider web emblazoned across it.
She stayed long enough to freshen up and eat while prospero and durathror loaded up the pack animals, then they all departed. The house seemed suddenly empty, but it also meant that nalini and i had privacy again.
Of course, things never stay that way for long. Paula and Ra'anor returned a week and a half later. Paula was excited &quot;I've managed to find my way to several different destinations. I even navigated the last part of the way here!&quot;
Ra'anor added &quot;She is getting better all the time. She still cannot sense your shadow from the viharani shadow, but she can sense further now than before. If you can have paula do the shifting on shorter journeys, it will be good practice for her.&quot;
Nalini and I were in the middle of cleaning the house; Ra'anor and Paula pitched in, and soon enough it was done. A little later we sat down to lunch.
Nalini had cooked a chinese style soup using chicken broth, vegetables, noodles and some chicken. Ra'anor remarked &quot;I didn't think you people ate meat? Or do you make an exception for poultry?&quot;
Nalini made a face. &quot;We have two confirmed meat eaters living here now, so we have meat that must be used up. Neither danny nor i have pieces of chicken, just you two.&quot; She smiled &quot;So enjoy your meal.&quot;
Paaula waited until we were drinking coffee afterwards to make her announcement. &quot;I had a long discussion with Ra'anor about pregnancies and babies. She says that you're the father danny.&quot;
I looked at paula and raised my eyebrows. This issue wasn't going to go away, we had to ensure that all three of us (perhaps four if we included prospero) were happy with the resolution. &quot;Nalini and I suspected as much. We guessed that the energy activation over-rode your contraception.&quot;
Ra'anor was nodding. Nalini asked &quot;How canyou tell Ra'anor?&quot;
&quot;Once you can see auras, you will be able to recognize the father's aura because it is initially present with the baby. Once the baby is born, the aura loses most of the influences from the parents. But I am sure that you are the father danny.&quot;
Nalini thought to me &lt;&lt;I wonder what paula wants?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Don't know - I guess we'll have to try to find out.&gt;&gt;. Aloud i said &quot;Among the viharani that isn't a problem. Here there are cultural problems - paula isn't supposed to be pregnant before she gets married, nalini and i are a couple, so i'm not supposed to fathering children on anyone else. But apart from that we're going to do all we can to look after paula and her daughter.&quot;
Ra'anor looked at me &quot;Who said it was a girl? Maybe you've been talking to her spirit?&quot;
&quot;I don't know why i said that - it just seems appropriate.&quot;
Ra'anor nodded. &quot;Time will tell. Now, I want to say something to all of you. All the cultural problems are crap - you three are bigger than that. You all need to look at things from our cultural perspective for a change. Danny, you and nalini are a couple, you love each other very deeply, so it shouldn't matter if either of you has a fling with someone else. If paula wasn't with prospero, I might even suggest the three of you set up house together as partners. Paula loves both of you, and I know you both love her. But two couples is a better situation; I'm encouraging paula to see how things develop with prospero.
&quot;Paula, it's your baby, the primary responsability for rearing it is yours. Danny has the second responsability, nalini is his partner, so she shares that responsability. They are letting you live here, and treating you as his sister, they will obviously help you raise the child. That's as much as you need from them, you're an independent person.
&quot;If things do work out with prospero, you'll need to decide what you tell him and when. But tell him you must, because we will ensure the child knows who her father is. There is no need to tell him yet, not until you know how things stand between the two of you.
&quot;Since you are with prospero, I do not suggest you visit danny and nalini's bed, unless you feel that prospero has grown enough to handle that. And even then, do not visit unless danny and nalini invite you, and be prepared to extend the same freedoms to prospero.&quot;
Paula was actually blushing. &quot;Ummm... I wasn't going to er... visit their bed as you put it...&quot;
Nalini smiled at her. &quot;Why not paula? You came uninvited to visit danny's bed once before, and that's what started all this. Invited is different. That means we've both decided we want you there. And didn't you tell us you'd had a lesbian relationship in the past?&quot;
Paula was recovering her composure. &quot;Yes, but don't tell prospero that! He wouldn't understand!&quot;
&quot;He might understand a lot better than you think. But if we invite you into our bed, he doesn't need to know. But Ra'anor is right, you'd have to extend the same courtesy to him. Could you?&quot;
&quot;I don't ask him what he does when he's away from me, so maybe I do. But i wasn't going to come between you and danny.&quot;
&quot;You can't paula&quot; i said emphatically &quot;no matter what you try. Our feelings for each other are too strong.&quot;
Nalini giggled. &quot;Oh, I don't know danny. If we put her in the middle, I'm sure she could come between us.&quot;
I suddenly saw exactly what she was playing at: get paula to admit she didn't want a menage a trois or to marry me, to decide she was happy with the role of defacto sister. Of course, it could backfire. I grinned. &quot;Well, we could take turns and keep her coming for quite a while. After all, she comes quite easily.&quot;
Paula was now looking from nalini to me and back again, mouth open, her cheeks turning crimson. Ra'anor was looking amused.
Nalini continued &quot;Of course she'd have to reciprocate, take turns with you to pleasure me.&quot;
&quot;Listen guys, I'm not setting up a menage a trois with you, and I'm not marrying danny, I'm not even going to share your bed, ok? Even if you do invite me. But I do want you to help me care for the baby.&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;That's no problem paula. We'll treet you like my sister and danny's sister. We've always said that.&quot; Suddenly she stuck her chest out and primped a little. &quot;But not even if we invite you? What's the matter paula, don't you find me attractive?&quot;
I think it dawned on paula then, because she nodded to herself. She smiled &quot;Nalini, I thought you weren't bisexual.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I'm not. You're the only girl I've been with, I have no desire to be with another girl. But Ra'anor's right, we both love you, so I'll make an exception for you. That is of course unless you find only danny sexually attractive.&quot;
Paula was blushing, but her grin widened. I think she decided to call nalini's bluff. &quot;Oh no, nalini, I find both of you sexually attractive. I enjoyed it then, I'm sure I'd enjoy it again. If you invite me that is. But nalini, do you find me sexually attractive?&quot;
Nalini looked at paula for a moment, made a rueful smile, then laughed. &quot;Paula, I never have been attracted to other women, but somehow I must be seeing you through danny's eyes, because somehow I do find you attractive. It's probably to do with the energy exchanges between the three of us. Danny and I have talked this over, he feels it too, so we presume you must as well.&quot;
Paula nodded. Nalini leaned forward to touch paula's hand. &quot;Paula, I would prefer if this had never happened, but it has. We all have to make the best of it. We will treat you like a sister, help you with the baby. I don't think any of us want to turn this into a menage a trois...&quot;
&quot;Uh uh.&quot; Paula shook her head. &quot;It'll be hard enough telling my parents I'm pregnant, let alone something like that. Plus I want a man of my own. Although, since we're being honest, if danny was available, I'd go for him...&quot;
Nalini said gently &quot;But he's not paula; I'm glad you realize that. And since we're being honest, should something ever happen to me, so that danny becomes available, you'd have my blessing. He needs a good woman to look after him, and you qualify.&quot;
She signalled me, we both got up and sat on either side of paula, hugging her. Ra'anor quietly stood and left the room. I spoke &quot;Paula, we both love you, no matter what happens, we'll take care of you, look after you. We can make this work, if you're willing. We're willing.&quot;
She hugged us back. &quot;Thanks guys.&quot; She kissed my cheek, I realized she was crying. She kissed nalini. &quot;I love you both.&quot; She broke into quiet sobs, while we sat and hugged her, rubbed her back. &quot;I didn't want to be pregnant... No, I feel I kinda spoiled it for us...&quot;
&quot;Things happen paula. It's how we react to them that's important. You're loved, you're important, you're part of our family now.&quot;
Paula's tears stopped as quickly as they started. &quot;Thanks guys, I think I just needed reassurance, and a hug.&quot;
&quot;Paula, if you need a hug, anytime, just come and get it off either of us. Okay?&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Paula, if you find yourself feeling lonely at night...&quot; she hesitated, consulted me, then continued &quot;..or horny, you're welcome to join us. I mean that, we mean that, we're giving you an open invitation, just don't abuse it, all right? And remember, we sleep naked.&quot;
Paula giggled &quot;I know, so do I these days.&quot; She drew a breath, became serious. &quot;Thanks again guys, I won't abuse it, but I will take you up on it sometime. Both of you, together. But not when prospero's around.&quot; She squeezed both of us.
To me nalini thought &lt;&lt;Oh danny! What have I let us in for?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;I know how you feel. Half of you wants to, the other half doesn't. But it doesn't affect how we feel about each other. Is it right? I don't know, in the end it comes back to choices we can live with and choices we can't.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I know we can live with this. Paula won't be hurt this way, though prospero might. We can love more than one person, I'm sure of that. But now she knows she can come to our bed, she's less likely to want to. I think anyway. I guess all we can do is see how things develop.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Forbidden fruit huh? I agree, she's less likely to try. As long as we have each other, I don't care what paula does.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;chuckle. It could be fun hey?&gt;&gt;.
 Later, I was outside hanging some washing on the line, and paula came out to help. &quot;I can't believe how things have turned out you know. Nalini almost shocked me today. But i've been thinking about what she said, and she's right - I do love both of you.&quot;
&quot;And we both love you.&quot; I gave her a hug.
She hugged me back. &quot;You know, I'm glad you're the father. You have your bond with nalini, but you also have your bond with me now.&quot;
I wasn't quite so happy about this, but I wouldn't let paula know that. &quot;I'm excited about the prospect of being a father. So's nalini actually.&quot;
&quot;Good! Hey, was she serious about an open invitation to share your bed? Do you think she meant sex as well? She seemed to suggest that.&quot;
&quot;She's torn two ways. On the one hand she doesn't find females sexually attractive, on the other hand she does find you sexually attractive. And we all enjoyed what happened at the time. Obviously we'd go in for energy sharing and a mental link like last time. So while we don't want to make a habit of it, we're both open to it happening again, and we'll do our best to enjoy it when it does.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot; she grinned impishly. &quot;So if I'm feeling horny, I'll come and join you two.&quot;
It was my turn to make the suggestive remark. &quot;Don't you mean you'll join us and come?&quot;
                                ***
The ploy seemed to have worked, for paula slept in her own bed, and stopped making suggestive remarks to me. Every time she did make one, I'd counter with the suggestion that she join us that night. She'd giggle, blush, threaten to do so, but never did.
Nalini and i agreed that the ploy was part of it, but so was dreaming. When Paula was staying with us, we'd often meet up in dreaming. When she was off in shadow she was normally in a different time zone, and often running at a different rate, so meetings in dreaming were rare then.
Prospero came and went, often taking paula with him. Their skills and energy levels were increasing, as was the bond between them.
Liz's energy levels were inproving slowly, and she started making progress in dreaming.
Nalini and I share dreaming most nights. We run our own agenda, we do different things on different nights. Sometimes we visit our own teachers, sometimes we visit particular shadows we may have passed through in order to garner some concrete information about them. Sometimes we meet with paula or prospero. Lately we'd been spending some time each night finding liz and showing her things to remember.
Nalini and I were in dreaming. We were sitting at an outdoor cafe, one we frequently use for a rendezvous. Others know about it, they can meet us there if they feel inclined.
Dreaming can look identical with waking, except that improbable and impossible things can happen. The tables are green wrought iron, covered with white table cloths, and are laid out in the middle of the street. Some have striped umbrellas above them, the colors seem to be different each time we come. That's to be expected I suppose, because the people sitting at a table determine whether their table has an umbrella, and what color it should be. On one side of the is a footpath with assorted shops, including the cafe proper, a newsagency (although why anyone would want a newsagency in dreaming escapes me) and a number of old curio shops and art and craft shops. The street itself is bluestone cobbles. On the other side is parkland, with many ornamental gardens, and pitoresque pathways through it. Further off is a sandstone university complex, where courses are run on anything and everything. Spread out around the park is a thriving town that acts as a gathering point to those who would attend the university. The sky is white.
Some of the people here are dreamers, by which I mean still attached to living physical bodies. Others could be termed spirits because there is no physical body asleep somewhere. Some of these latter qualify as spirits of the dead, because once they did have physical bodies, but others never had a physical body. They are not angels, not demons, nor mischevious elementals. There is no word in english that describes them, I will simply label them spirit beings.
There is also another class of denizens here - that of dreaming construct. For example, the waiters at the cafe are mostly constructs, with no life force behind them. Think of them as computer simulations, except that we create these simulations. It is easy for us to tell the difference - living beings, including spirit beings, possess auras, while constructs do not. Auras are much easier to see in dreaming, but not everyone can.
Nalini and I were sitting at one of the tables, minding coffees, watching the scenery, and talking. Our table started out with a green and white umbrella, but at some stage i had idly changed it to a large inflated beachball, colored red, yellow and blue. It simply hovered in the air above our table. The shops were to my right, the park to my left, while nalini sat across from me.
The people around were human looking, clothing ranging from all ages of history, plus some I didn't recognize, along with some nudity. There were a scattering of other creatures as well, but they were passing by, not sitting at the tables. One category was the guides, odd looking dark shapes like truncated telegraph poles, another category resembled blue and orange sea urchins about the size of a soccer ball. Both these types were spirit beings, and could teach dreamers much abut dreaming.
I was wearing dark blue jeans and a light blue t-shirt. It resembled one that liz had given me - an aboriginal design entitled 'Ocean Dreaming'. Nalini wore black jeans and a green t-shirt with a tiger standing on a rock. In dreaming, our auras are a mixture of gold and blue. Other than that, we look much the same as in waking.
We had been finding liz every night for the past three weeks, bringing her here. Each night we would wait for her, but always we had to dispatch a guide to find her, or look for her ourselves.
As we waited, paula arrived. Her dreaming body is now slimmer than her physical one, with exercises and martial arts training she has put on some muscle. In dreaming she looks almost anorexic. Her pale face contrasted with her bright red lipstick, green eyes and black hair. She was wearing black t-shirt, black micro-mini skirt that left almost nothing to the imagination, and black lace up shoes. Her aura has a lot of red in it, along with some green, yellow and blue.
&quot;Hi guys!&quot; She hugged nalini, then kissed her on the mouth. Nalini hugged back, held the kiss briefly, then drew away.
&quot;Paula, I know we said anything goes in dreaming, but I think I'm not ready for tongue kissing with you yet. Can we work up to that slowly?&quot;
Paula in dreaming can be quite outrageous and flirty, but we've all agreed that conventional morals don't apply. Paula has used that to her advantage to have dreaming sex with me on a number of occasions.
She countered &quot;But nalini, what would you do if i was to wake you up right now by climbing into your bed?&quot;
Nalini looked at her with a wry smile. &quot;We'd manage something.&quot; Then she grinned. &quot;Get me excited first paula, and then see what happens. But we are waiting for liz at the moment, so i'd prefer you didn't wake us right now. I know better than to dare you to do something.&quot;
Paula grinned. &quot;Dare me to and I will climb into your bed, and I'll make sure you don't get any sleep!&quot;
&quot;Well you'd better make sure I enjoy it then. Now go kiss danny, he's probably feeling left out.&quot;
She giggled. &quot;I'm sure that danny and i will make sure you enjoy yourself.&quot; She threw herself enthusiastically into my lap, wrapped her arms around me, and started tongue kissing.
I suffered it good naturedly for a minute or so, kissing her back, then i pulled back and commented &quot;Hey, don't over do it in nalini's presence, she'll feel left out.&quot;
&quot;She didn't wanna. Hey. I'm horney, can we go someplace else for a while?&quot;
&quot;Nah, you know the rules. If i'm by myself, no problem, but when nalini's around, her wishes take precedence.&quot;
&quot;Well, she can join in.&quot;
&quot;Paula, you're always horney. All right, let's get this over with. Make room for me.&quot; Nalini is another person you don't dare to do something, she'll often do it just to prove a point.
Sex in dreaming can be a steamy, sweaty replica of physical sex, but it doesn't have to be. Sex is energy sharing, and in dreaming that can be performed with little more than a hug.
Paula was sitting on my lap. She moved to sling one leg behind me, causing her skirt to ride up around her hips. Her panties were semi transparent. Nalini sat astride both out laps, grabbed paula's face with both her hands, and kissed her the way she kisses me. Paula's eyes widened with surprise.
Then she drew back, placed an arm around each of us and asked &quot;Are we all ready?&quot;
It starts as a warm flow of energy that builds up into a whole body orgasm that lasts minutes, sometimes longer. This one lasted for a while.
The glow faded, nalini leaned against me. Paula leaned back and commented &quot;Phew! That was great! Thanks guys!&quot;
Nalini kissed me, then stood. &quot;Now maybe you won't need to wake us up?&quot; She sat down opposite me again.
&quot;Nah, I probably won't need to wake you guys up. I'll wait until you're awake.&quot; Paula moved and sat between nalini and myself. She waved a hand in the air. &quot;Hey! Waiter!&quot; A waiter materialized beside her. &quot;A cappachino and one of those russian pushka thingies.&quot; She turned to us. &quot;So how's liz doing?&quot;
&quot;She's improving. She is awake for longer in dreaming, but she still gets distracted easily, and can't remember things from one session to the next.&quot;
I added &quot;We've been bringing her here every night for the past few weeks, we keep hoping that one day she'll turn up without having to be brought.&quot;
Paula was suddenly serious. &quot;Maybe if we all thought together, we could influence her?&quot;
&quot;It might work.&quot; Nalini stretched her hand across the table. I took one, paula the other, and paula and i held hands. Nalini and i linked minds, and then we waited while paula got herself into the right state. We felt tentative touches, then suddenly she opened up, and linked with us.
When we link like this, it is quite easy to pick up the other person's emotions, feelings and thoughts. Nalini and i have no secrets between us, but we are learning to block ourselves off from others.
Nalini: a deep warm well of love, a current of emotions running so deep we did not know their source. If ever faced with a choice between nalini and someone else, say paula, there would be no choice. Nalini i would die for, without thinking about it, without regrets; I have done so in the past. There is also an implicit trust, a mutual respect and love that goes back maybe thousands of lifetimes.
Paula: light, flighty, impressions of a butterfly. But there is also a love from her to us, and from us to her. We have to indulge her a little, as well as take care of her. LIke a little sister, she is a younger soul than nalini and i. Like nalini, she was born in the year of the tiger, which makes her compatible with me.
We formed an impression of liz, part image, part feeling. Liz sitting at her computer, typing away. Often with one foot tucked onto the seat, not necessarily the most modest thing to do in a miniskirt. Liz stuffing her face with cake, with cream or icing smeared around her mouth like a little kid. She loves food. Liz at the beach resort, swimming around like a fish, or sunbathing topless in a bright orange bikini bottom on a blue towel. &lt;&lt;danny!&gt;&gt; from paula. &lt;&lt;I thought you liked girls?&gt;&gt; from me. &lt;&lt;Huh!&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Let's just concentrate on liz, however we visualize her. She had nice breasts anyway.&gt;&gt; from nalini.
Liz, suddenly turning to face us, wearing nothing but a pair of pink panties, a puzzled look on her face. I hold out my hand, and she is standing before us. &quot;How did I get here? And where is here?&quot;
&quot;Hi Liz!&quot; Nalini hugs her, then I hug her, then paula. We break out link.
Liz smiled at us and looked around. &quot;I've been here before, haven't I?&quot; She sat down at the vacant seat between nalini and me, opposite paula. A waiter materialized nearby. &quot;Black coffee, hot skim milk on the side, and a mud cake thanks.&quot;
The twirling beach ball hovering above our heads caught her eyes, and she stared at it open mouthed. Nalini clicked her fingers to attract attention. &quot;Liz, do you know where you are?&quot;
Liz grinned and looked around at us. &quot;I've been here before, haven't I?&quot;
&quot;She's stoned!&quot; paula exclaimed.
&quot;No, that's what most dreamers are like. They lack the energy to keep their attention focused for more than a few seconds.&quot; i explained.
Nalini smiled at paula &quot;You used to be like that you know.&quot;
&quot;Never! Can we do anything to help her?&quot;
The coffee had arrived, and liz was staring at reflections in the coffee. &quot;Yes, we can give her an energy boost. Do you want to help?&quot;
&quot;Is that like energy sharing?&quot;
&quot;Nah, it's one way only. You don't get to have an orgasm.&quot;
Paula clicked her fingers and Tsked. Nalini reached out, took liz's right hand, then paula's left. I took liz's left hand, and paula's right. I reached for the source of energy, felt it flow into me through my head, down to my heart, and out my right hand into liz. There was a small flow from paula as well. Liz continued to stare into her coffee cup, but after a few minutes she started, and stared around as if newly awakened.
&quot;Sorry guys, I must have drifted off for a moment. All this walking makes me tired. What were you saying?&quot;
Paula asked &quot;Do you know where you are liz?&quot;
&quot;Not really. This is some shadow that danny and nalini have taken me to before.&quot; She added a small amount of milk to her coffee, drank some. &quot;Mmm, coffee's good. Isn't that why we come here?&quot;
&quot;You could say that.&quot; Nalini looked secretly amused, waiting for liz to realise she was dreaming.
&quot;We also want you to remember this place so you can find it again in dreaming. Liz, try to remember this, picture it in your mind.&quot;
&quot;How long will that last?&quot; paula asked.
&quot;Maybe ten or fifteen minutes, then it fades again.&quot; nalini replied. &quot;We can give her more boosts, but it's frustrating. She needs to get over some threshold limit, and we don't know what to do.&quot;
One of the guides had been hovering near the tables. It appeared to be a black cylinder about eight or nine inches in diameter (say eighteen to twenty centimeters) and about six feet (or two meters) high. It was completely featureless. It seemed to want to attract the attention of a dreamer, because it would hover in its usual shape, then suddenly change into a brightly colored buterfly with a wingspan about as big as my outstretched arms. It would flap several times, then change back to the truncated telegraph pole again.
&quot;What about asking the guide?&quot; I indicated with my head.
Nalini swivelled to look. &quot;If anyone knows, they would. Let's attract it.&quot;
&quot;How?&quot; liz asked. She was still part of our conversation.
&quot;Simple, they want our attention. When a dreamer focusses on them, they feel it. Watch.&quot; We both stared intently at the guide, which suddenly shifted into a replica of the floating beach ball, and came to hover beside nalini.
&quot;We'd like your help.&quot; we both said.
&quot;Certainly. How may I assist you?&quot; Its voice was english, popping into our heads, but not in the same way as nalini's telepathy. It was if it was directly stimulating something that transmitted hearing.
Nalini and i explained the problem we were having with liz. Liz was still alert enough to follow our explanation, and nod. &quot;I can't believe this is dreaming though. It feels just like being awake.&quot;
The guide replied &quot;Normally I would not do anything for her, she is not advanced enough. However, you are, and you will help her to develop her potential to a point where she is advanced enough. What you need to do is to open her energy channel wider. There is very little flowing at present. Normally it takes a dreamer years of practice to open their channel sufficiently.&quot;
Liz was looking at the guide intently, &quot;You're a talking beachball! Aren't you?&quot;
The guide flicked back to the telegraph pole. &quot;You will need some of my energy to do this. But you must not prevent me from instructing her if she wishes.&quot;
&quot;We will not prevent you.&quot;
Liz looked puzzled. &quot;Why would you want to help? Why would it instruct me?&quot;
The guide continued to ignore her. &quot;Nalini, danny, you must each place your left hand upon me. Nalini, place your other hand here...&quot; a ghostly hand appeared at the back of liz's head &quot;.. Danny, place your other hand here...&quot; another ghostly hand appeared between her shoulder blades. &quot;Paula, please come here. Put your left hand on me, and your right hand here...&quot; a third ghostly hand appeared at the base of liz's spine. We did as directed. &quot;You will feel a strong current of energy. Do not be alarmed.&quot;
The guide was right. The current felt like an electric shock. Paula cried out in surprise. Liz started moaning, almost like she was orgasming, because her body spasmed, her pelvis thrusting forward while her shoulders hunched with each moan. I could see a line of yellow fire running through her aura.
The current shut off. Liz slumped forward, breathing harshly. Paula massaged her arms. &quot;Boy, that was painful.&quot;
The guide remarked &quot;All of you should have more energy now.&quot; It was right, colors seemed brighter, details sharper. &quot;The girl will remember this, and will remember her future dreams. In a little while she will be suitable for me to instruct.&quot;
Liz sat up again, turned to look at the three of us standing behind her. Her heavy brows made her look angry. &quot;What are you guys doing to me? And what's that thing?&quot;
&quot;Child, I am a guide. I can teach you many things about dreaming, and I can offer you the chance of immortality, if you prove suitable.&quot;
&quot;What's the catch?&quot;
&quot;There is no catch. Not everyone is suitable, and not everyone wants what we offer. As you progress a little more, I will begin to teach you things about dreaming.&quot;
&quot;It's all right liz.&quot; nalini commented. &quot;They have their own agenda. You must think very carefully about any offer of immortality they may give. But for now you can accept what they teach you, they are experts in this realm.&quot;
I turned to the guide. &quot;Thank you for your help. I am sure you will follow us all with interest.&quot;
&quot;Oh you may be sure of that. I will return frequently. Farewell.&quot; It drifted away toward some other tables.
Nalini asked &quot;Liz, do you know where you are?&quot;
She nodded. &quot;I know I'm dreaming, although I'm damned if I know how I know that. I know I've been here before, I can remember dreaming it. Will I remember this when I wake up?&quot;
&quot;There's a good chance you will liz. The guide has opened your energy channels a bit, so you should find it much easier now.&quot;
Paula interupted &quot;Liz, does it bother you that you're sitting there in just your panties?&quot;
Liz shrugged. &quot;It's just tits. Nothing you two haven't got. And danny's seen them before.&quot; She sat up, thrust her breasts out, grinned. &quot;If he wants to admire them, I don't mind. He talks to me, not my tits.&quot;
&quot;I'm happy to admire them if you're happy showing them. Nalini doesn't mind me looking.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;If you've got it flaunt it hey? Paula, have you forgotten you used to turn up stark naked?&quot;
&quot;Um... I had actually. that was a long time ago. I guess hers are bigger than mine.&quot;
&quot;And you can change that here if you want to.&quot; I commented. &quot;Liz, enjoy your coffee before it gets cold. I'm sure you have lots of questions to ask us.&quot;
&quot;Hey, did you guys order for me? This is just how I like it!&quot;
&quot;No, you ordered yourself, but you went back to sleep. Your energy levels weren't high enough to maintain your awareness.&quot;
&quot;Hmm... cake's good too!&quot; Liz spoke with her mouth full.
Paula meanwhile looked as if she were going crosseyed. Suddenly her shape flickered, rippled and then she was half leopard, half female. She appeared to be naked, but covered with short fur patterned with leopard spots. The fur faded out about the level of her breasts, though the spots continue to her neck. Her breasts were much bigger, probably D cup or even larger.
&quot;Very good paula!&quot; nalini commented.
She grinned saucily &quot;Now my tits are bigger, you can admire mine!&quot;
&quot;Yeah, but can you stop trying to be the center of attention? We're here for liz.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;You'd better stare at them danny, make her happy.&quot; I did so for a minute or so. Liz was sufficiently surprised that she had stopped eating, and was sitting with her mouth half open. Nalini added &quot;Paula, would you like us all to feel them as well? Would that make you happier? Would you like me to grow a penis and spread you here on the table?&quot;
Paula realized she was overstepping the mark. &quot;Oh... I just didn't want liz to feel she was the odd one out.... sorry.&quot;
&quot;All right. We love you very much paula, but we're here to explain things to liz. Can you just behave a little less outrageously?&quot;
Paula nodded, switched back to her normal self. &quot;I might have a cake. Waiter!&quot; she waved a hand in the air.
&quot;Liz, you obviously have questions. Ask away. We'll try to answer them all.&quot;
&quot;I dunno where to start. How did paula do that? Where are we? How did I get here?&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;And is paula always like this? No, she just needs a good screw. The sooner prospero gets back the better, it'll stop her eyeing off danny.&quot;
&quot;Maybe it's full moon?...&quot; paula started. She caught the look on nalini's face. &quot;Sorry. I'll behave.&quot;
&quot;Good.&quot; I turned to liz. &quot;Perhaps you should tell us what you think first, so we know where to start?&quot;
&quot;Okay, I'm dreaming, aren't I? And so are all of you.&quot; We nodded. &quot;So where are we? How come it looks so real? How can we actually meet up?&quot;
Nalini started &quot;All right, all of us have 3 separate bodies, our physical, our dreaming body, and a spirit body. They are something like different octaves of the same note, if that makes sense. So you can have a C note that's low, go up an octave and have another C note that is the same, but higher.&quot;
Liz nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I did some music at school.&quot;
&quot;Good. They each have their own awareness, and are capable of acting independently of each other. Most of the time we aren't even aware of this...&quot;
Liz was shaking her head.
I explained &quot;When you are awake, that is your waking awareness, or your physical body's awareness. That is what we normally think of as ourselves. You clear so far?&quot; Liz nodded. &quot;Good. Now consider what happens when we go to sleep. What happens to our waking or physical awareness?&quot;
&quot;Um... I'd guess it goes to sleep. But what about when we dream?&quot;
&quot;Ah, you're on to it. Our attention is usually with our physical awareness, especially when we are awake. But when the physical body goes to sleep, the physical awareness is also asleep, or at some very low level. Our attention turns to our dreaming body, and its awareness. So right now, your physical is asleep, your attention is on your dreaming body. You can't remember how you were a little while ago, but paula commented you were acting as if you were stoned. You did things like stare at the reflections in your coffee. You kept saying the same thing over and over, because you'd forgotten you'd said it.&quot;
&quot;Really?!&quot;
&quot;Most people are the same when they dream. Their dreaming awareness lacks energy, has never been trained the way our physical awareness has been, it's not very useful to most people. Now, we asked a guide to help us, and it boosted your energy, and opened your channel wider. You need to practice in dreaming to keep that channel open.&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;At the moment, your attention is focussed on your dreaming awareness. Because of your energy levels, a lot of your waking awareness has transferred itself to your dreaming body. When your energy fades, as it will later tonight, you will revert back to what you were. You should be able to remember things in waking though, because your waking awareness is present now. This is what makes the difference between dreams you can't remember or vaguely remember, and dreams you can rmemeber quite vividly. Keep doing your energy exercises, and you will improve. You should be able to find your own way here tomorrow night.&quot;
&quot;Where is here?&quot;
&quot;It's the astral isn't it?&quot; paula put in.
&quot;Probably.&quot; i replied. &quot;There aren't any adequate words in english. The Astral Realm is one term, the World of Dreaming is another, and even the Spirit World. You might be more familiar with the last, this is where shamans come in trances, this is where most of the spirit beings live.&quot;
Liz was looking more alert now, nodding.
Nalini continued &quot;This world is like our dreaming body, similar to the physical world, but a higher octave. Parts of it correspond with the physical world, so you can be floating around your bedroom and see yourself asleep in bed.&quot;
&quot;That's happened to me a couple of times. Scared the hell out of me the first time, I thought I was dying. Then my grandma told me i was in the spirit world, but where it overlaps our own, and if i was good the spirits would teach me things.&quot;
Nalini smiled, nodded. &quot;And she was right. Other parts of the spirit world don't overlap, some like here mimic the physical world, and other parts don't correspond at all. The guides, which we'll get to soon, are spirit beings, and they will be able to teach you things about this world. Now, there are two things you should notice about us. First, do you see swirls of color surrounding each of us?&quot;
Lis shook her head. &quot;Nope, you look about the same as normal.&quot;
&quot;All right, that will come later. I was going to point out that we all have auras, that's what they're called. Everyone else around here has an aura, including the guides. But the waiters do not. They are not real in the sense that you and i are real, they are a dreaming construct. For now you'll have to accept this. One day you will start to see auras and you will know what I mean.
&quot;The spirit world, or dreaming world, can be changed by our thoughts. That was how paula changed into a leopard woman and back again. The furniture, the surroundings, even the coffee and cake are constructs.&quot; She concentrated for a moment, and several small brightly colored butterflies appeared and fluttered around paula. &quot;I just created those butterflies.&quot;
&quot;Kewl! I guess I'l learn how to do that in due course?&quot;
&quot;Yes. Now the other thing you should notice is that each of us has a fiber or line coming out of the backs of our heads.&quot; I turned my head and she pointed out my line to liz. It's a ghostly line, something like smoke, and not always easy to see. &quot;That is a line that connects our dreaming bodies to our physical ones. Anyone you see with such a line is a dreamer, regardless of their shape. Anyone who doesn't have such a line does not have a physical body. Some will be people who have died, while others are like the guides - they are spirit beings, they never had a physical body.&quot;
I added &quot;Something else about your dreaming awareness - sometimes it does intrude into waking. You know sometimes you have a sense of deja vu, or sometimes a premonition? That's your dreaming awareness intruding into waking. Meditation and some of the energy exercises help to align both awarenesses, so they cross over and support each other. This is to be encouraged. In a sense, the three awarenesses are something like the three legs of a stool. Most people spend their lives with their stool balanced on only one leg. We are learning to be different.&quot;
Liz smiled. &quot;I can relate to explanations like that. I was going to ask what or where is the attention you mentioned before, the one that focusses on awareness? But I guess you'll tell me its in the seat of the stool&quot;
I grinned. &quot;Very good! I'm not sure what the seat represents, something behind the three bodies, but none of us are advanced enough to know what that is. Nalini and I loosely refer to it as the soul, but we could be quite wrong. All I can say is that development is a process that takes lifetimes.&quot;
&quot;Phew!&quot; Liz stared off into the distance for a while. &quot;So some of these are dead people, and some are spirit beings. How can you tell the difference?&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;That isn't always easy. The guides are those telegraph pole like things, those blue and orange puff balls are another type, they're both spirit beings. If you see a human shape, chances are it's either a dreamer or a dead person. Spirit beings don't often masquerade as humans. When you can see the aura, you'll recognize human auras even when the er... being in question is shaped differently. If it's not a human aura, then you have to use other knowledge. This region is where humans come, so if it isn't human, it probably is a spirit being. If you're somewhere else, you may have to ask. If there is a guide with you, then ask the guide. They seem to know everything.&quot;
Liz was looking thoughtful, puzzled. I admonished &quot;Don't worry liz, find your way here tomorrow night, and we'll run over this again. We'll also talk to you tomorrow about what you can remember, and run through this in waking. Eventually the knowledge will stick.&quot;
Liz nodded. &quot;I think I'll need you to go over it several times. But that's cool.&quot;
Paula was almost bouncing up and down in her seat. &quot;Hey liz, aren't you going to ask the obvious question?&quot;
&quot;Uh... what's that?&quot;
&quot;If there are dead people here, what happens when we die?&quot;
Liz nodded again. &quot;Yeah, what does happen?&quot; She looked surprised &quot;Oh, gotta go pee!&quot; and vanished. She had obviously woken up.
&quot;Hey guys, now she's gone, can we go look at that shadow we passed through a week ago?&quot;
                                ***
We did continue the discussion the next morning, over coffee. Paula awake was much more demure. Imladril told us it was just a phase she was going through, that her dreaming personality was less mature, but would eventually mesh with her waking one.
Liz did remember some of the dream, but could not recall it as being lucid, just vivid. We ran through our explanations again. This time she asked more questions &quot;Okay, if there are dead people in the spirit world, what happens to us when we die? Doesn't sound like what the priest told us.&quot;
Nalini took a breath. &quot;Well, most of them make their way to the human region. Not necessarily the area we were in, but somewhere around there. They hang around there for a while, eventually their dreaming body also dies, or is sloughed like a snake skin, leaving only the spirit body. Then it sets about creating a new dreaming body, and a new physical body. It becomes a new baby somewhere. That process can take anywhere from a couple of years to centuries or longer.&quot;
&quot;So we're not judged or anything, or sent to hell?&quot;
&quot;No. We judge ourselves, because we can see things more clearly, and remember past lives. The process of rebirth happens because the spirit body desires to be reborn. How it picks where to be born tends to depend on its own desires when it wants to be reborn. It might want to be with loved ones, or it might like a particular region, or life style, or anything.&quot;
I added &quot;Basically there is no punishment, no justice, just the cycle of birth and death and rebirth. Human desires and expectations determine what happens. Even when we die, if we expect to sit on a white cloud with a harp, then we'll construct such a place, and sit there until we grow bored, or something happens to make us realise that it's all a fake. People construct whole cities to fit their expectations. That place where we were last night is such a construct. Thousands of people live there - it's a university town, there are classes on anything and everything. You can study art, literature, dreaming, even nuclear physics, and wake up with a new idea. That place is more difficult to change because the collective wills of thousands of people keep it as it is. So it resembles the physical world much more.&quot;
Paula added &quot;I've read that people report swimming through a tunnel of light, and being greeted by dead relatives.&quot;
I smiled &quot;I may have died many times, but I don't recall what happened after I died. I have been told that someone is there to greet a newly deceased person. I mean, there are spirit beings and dreaming bodies and dead souls probably floating through this room right now, except we can't see them. Our dreaming bodies can, and when we get them in sync with our physical bodies we'll see them in waking. Chances are someone is watching us when we die.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;But if we die of natural causes, most of the time we know some time before we die. So we have time to arrange for relatives to be with us. Liz, you can find your dead relatives in dreaming. You can even find your living ones, but unless they have enough energy, they won't remember meeting you.&quot;
Liz looked at us, her brown eyes wide. &quot;No justice, no punishment. Does god exist, or is it all just some cruel joke?&quot;
Nalini said quietly &quot;God exists. We are all just dreams within his mind. But there is no punishment in the usual Judeo-Christian sense. We go on with our lives, part of us is reborn, and learns from our experiences. Most of us are on a slow path toward eventual re-union with god. Some are on a downward spiral. Demons exist also. By that I mean spirit beings that hate us and try to thwart our endeavours and to hurt us. Some spirit beings are friendly, most are not. The ones you encounter in human regions are friendly. Venture out of there at your own peril.&quot;
&quot;In fact, don't venture out of the human regions unless you have a spirit guide with you.&quot; I added.
&quot;What are they? Are they like angels?&quot;
&quot;Not really, though some of their actions may be angelic. Often they will warn us of things about to happen. If we can hear them, often they talk incessantly to us.&quot;
&quot;They run their own agenda.&quot; I added. &quot;They will nurture dreaming awareness, teach us anything about dreaming, and show us through the non human realms. They don't lie, but that doesn't mean they always tell the whole truth. At some stage they will offer you immortality. Find out everything you can, and think very carefully before accepting that offer. Nalini and I have rejected that offer, paula has not yet had the offer made.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;They do offer a kind of immortality, where your dreaming body is preserved for eons somewhere in their own realm. In a sense, you become a kind of spirit being yourself. That is a path danny and i have chosen not to walk. We can't tell you if that decision is right or wrong, only that we made a decision we can live with. At some stage both of you will face that same decision.&quot;
&quot;But apart from all that,&quot; i added &quot;they can be quite useful. They can find shadows for you, guide you there in dreaming, and help you find out about a place before you visit it. They are friendly, and they do tell the truth.&quot; I activated my sorcerous sight. &quot;In fact, there is one floating over by the window right now.&quot;
&quot;That's scary!&quot; Liz complained.
&quot;Don't let them scare you liz, they will not harm you, they will always seek to protect you. They are something like angels.&quot;

&quot;It will be the wedding of the decade! The celebrations will last all week! All of you have to come!&quot; Prospero spread butter on his muffin, followed by some marmelade. He, durathror and ra'anor had arrived earlier that morning, early enough that the rest of us were still in the process of getting showered and dressed.
&quot;Nalini and I will be there. Can we bring liz as well?&quot;
&quot;Of course! She is our friend, even though my lord amrik does not know her, all the lords are bringing all their relatives, and the king certainly does not know all of them.&quot;
&quot;Prospero, you will have to advise us on a suitable gift for the royal couple.&quot; Nalini remarked.
&quot;I will try, but I am not co-ordinating wedding gifts. I am sure we can find something suitable in this shadow.&quot;
Durathror grinned &quot;We could go shopping through several diferent shadows like last time. But we might avoid the gym equipment this time.&quot;
&quot;What do the nobles think of amrik marrying enyil?&quot; nalini asked.
Prospero chuckled. &quot;They all have their noses out of joint, because they all hoped the king would marry one of their daughters. But on the other hand, they are happier than if he had married some other noble's daughter, because that way none of their rivals gets to be the king's father in law!&quot;
Liz arrived soon after, and prospero explained again that his king amrik was getting married to the lady enyil of the viharani, and that there would be a week long celebration. &quot;And you are invited too liz.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Er... thanks prospero. Who else is going?&quot;
I smiled &quot;We're all going liz. You want a paid holiday with us? Visiting Prospero's home shadow, a sort of renaisance paradise, and spending time as a noble lady?&quot;
Liz chuckled &quot;Never thought of myself as a noble lady. But thanks danny, nalini. I can't afford to take a holiday right now, but I'd love to come. How many hours would you pay me for?&quot;
&quot;We have to regularize your working hours, especially seeing as paula is hardly ever here to do her work. We expect to be gone for 2 weeks, so let's say ten days pay? More if we're away longer.&quot;
&quot;Wow! Thanks, that's great.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;We'll have to hire a couple of temps for while we're away, so you two girls had better make sure they know how to do your work.&quot;
They nodded. Liz asked &quot;Hey, what do I tell my parents?&quot;
&quot;Tell them we're going interstate on business, you're invited, that we'll do a little sight seeing while we're away.&quot;
Nalini added with a smile &quot;Just be careful what pictures you show them!&quot;
                                ***
We only had a couple of weeks, and we needed to hire a couple of temps who not only could do the work, but also could be trusted inside our house while we were away. That meant we needed to interview them and check their auras as well as their personalities.
The house is designed with a long corridor running from the front door past the living room and study, past the downstairs bathroom and toilet, past the staircase and the dining room entrance into the family room at the back. There is a set of ornamental bi-fold doors at the end of the corridor.
We decided we should install a more solid door in the corridor before the staircase and dining room entrance, so the temps would have access to the toilet and bathroom, but not the rest of the house. We could also put a lock on the living room door, thus locking the large office, but that would leave the two sharing the study. We compromised, putting a lock on the diningroom door at the other end of the office, and moving valuable things like the laptops and some ornaments out of the office. It was a shame about the door in the corridor though.
We ended up hiring Ami Tan, an Australian born chinese student doing accounting; who is still with us, running the accounting and billing side of our business. She was studying part time, and wanted part time work to help her pay her way through university. Our work suited her because she could fit it around her university hours. Ami is about five seven, reasonably slim, with black hair and eyes, and yellow skin of the more southern chinese.
We also hired maria, a petite Italian girl with dark hair and flashing eyes to do the word processing. We agreed on minimum hours, including allowing her to take a day off if there was no work, provided that ami could look after the office in her absence. The work had to be done, but it didn't matter if they did it at 6 am or 6 pm, as long as customer deadlines were met. Between them they had to ensure that the office had someone to answer the phone during normal business hours. They also had to water the plants in our absence.
                                ***
Coming up to the day, there was more organizing to do. Nalini, paula and i went shopping for a suitable wedding present. Part of the problem was simply that anything remotely useful would have already been given by the nobles; we didn't want to present something gaudy and useless. What can you give someone who is the king of a kingdom that is probably almost as large as Europe, and is the trading center for half the world?
We'd already presented Amrik with a full complement of gym equipment, high tech armor from some distance futuristic shadow, and the finest samurai sword we could buy. Weapons aren't suitable wedding presents, and even if they were, we had no intention of presenting modern firearms, missiles or the like. Prospero had presented amrik with one hundred rifles and ammunition; he'd looked at them, tried one out, thought about things for a while, then told prospero to take them back. He regarded them as too dangerous. Prospero had been crestfallen, but he'd brought them back to our house, and now we had a small arsenal hidden away under lock and key. Amrik wasn't being stupid, he had realised that other nations could copy the rifles once they knew about them, and could easily destroy the current military superiority that Aquilonia enjoyed, and with it the pax aquilonia. Guns would undoubtedly be invented there, but he preferred to wait until they were. All these considerations did not stop him from keeping a fortyfive semi automatic pistol which prospero also to him; he wore that where ever he went, along with the sword we had given him.
In the end, nalini and i hired a van, and accompanied by durathror and ra'anor, loaded up about a ton of choice chocolates, a ton of glace fruits and other confectionary, two palette loads of some of the best wine we could find, all of which would be consumed at the feast. We also bought an ornate bone china oriental style coffee set and similar tea set, along with a selection of the finest coffee beans and finest teas from several shadows.
With four of us the cabin was cramped, but I drove while durathror shifted us. Driving necessitated staying on something resembling a road, but that brought its own risks, as sometimes the traffic would be travelling on the opposite side of the road from which we occupied, and we would find ourselves driving toward oncoming traffic.
For three hours we followed a road that was sometimes black top, sometimes gravel and often rutted cart track, before we found ourselves in tarantia, at the city gates. Our van caused much consternation, but we drove through the gates, up the hill and into the palace courtyard.
Amrik himself stepped out to greet us - the appearance of sorcerers driving a horseless carriage was newsworthy enough to reach the king's ears. Amrik is a tall man, perhaps six three or six four, with a body builder's muscles, shoulder length dark hair, ice blue eyes, clean shaven. He looked about thirty. He was dressed in simple military uniform, almost indistinguishable from prospero's - dark brown leather boots, red trousers, sky blue jacket buttoned almost to the neck. The high prussian style collar bore a stylized bull's head on each side, worked in gold, whereas Prospero's collar bore two gold suns. He gave me and durathror gruff hugs, bent to kiss ra'anor on the cheek, and gave nalini a bearhug and kiss.
Enyil was with him. She is also tall, perhaps five seven or five eight, with the honey skin, blond hair and green eyes typical of the viharani. She wore green plaid slacks, white lace up bodice and dark green and red plaid jacket. She kissed me and nalini on the cheek, but greeted durathror and ra'anor more warmly.
We exchanged pleasantries, congratulated them on their forthcoming marriage. Amrik grinned, looked fondly over to where she was talking with durathror and ra'anor &quot;Aye, she is a good woman. A mind of her own, skilled in battle, the sort of wife a warrior needs. Not like all these high bred noble women, who faint at the site of blood or a coarse remark from one of the soldiers. Marrying her has set the cat among the pidgeons, i can tell you. All the nobles opposed it, until prospero pointed out that this meant that none of their rivals would be my father in law! Each has now realized they are better off with this outcome.&quot;
Enyil gestured, and a servant appeared. She spoke briefly to him, he barked some orders into the door behind, and kitchen hands appeared to unload the goods we had brought.
Amrik personally conducted us inside to a small audience chamber looking over an ornamental garden, and views to the river. Refreshments were served - pastries, fruit, two carafs of wine and even a pot of strong, sweet black coffee.
Amrik turned to us &quot;And when are you two getting married? Enyil and I will be coming to your wedding.&quot;
&quot;We have yet to set the date, or rather the dates. The fact that danny's parents live in one shadow, while mine in another complicates matters, especially since none of them know about shadows, or that we can travel between them. But when will you visit us? You must take time off from your duties and pay us a visit.&quot;
&quot;I intend to visit numerous friends ofter the wedding. There are people I must see in several shadows, so enyil and i will visit you in perhaps three or four weeks. I tell you, who would want to be a king?! I try to be a good king, but everyone wants your attention, and you must hear their urgent plea and do something to advantage them over their fellows.
&quot;But things are changing slowly. I am in the process of setting up a permanent public service, which will report to my advisers. I have convened a parliament of the nobles, and I am in the process of setting up a parliament of commoners. The nobles support their own parliament, because they realise that together they can have a say in how i govern, and the laws that are passed. They are vehemently opposed to the parliament of commoners, because they know this will give the common people a say. Fahgh! It is all about protecting their own priviledges at the expense of everyone else's. I come from common stock, I know what it is like to have nobles who treat us like dirt. And now a commoner is their king, and is curbing their priviledges. Hah! I have little sympathy for their grievances, and the army supports me.&quot;
Enyil joined in our conversation. &quot;What is making them accept the changes is that the king's power will also have limits set upon it. Presently the king is the law, which works when there is a good king, but fails badly when the king is weak or foolish. We strive to impose limits on both the king and the barons&quot;
Amrik added &quot;The excesses of the old king brought on the revolution. I did not choose to be king, but as the warlord, I commanded the armies. Once I imprisoned the king, I found myself in charge. The nobles were fighting amongst themselves, each wanting to be king himself, and lesser nobles scheming to put the degenerate slime back on the throne. Another faction backed prospero, since as the king's cousin, once the king and his heirs were out of the way, prospero was next in line. I would have supported prospero, he is my friend, i trust him, but he refused, and insisted that he crown me!&quot;
Ra'anor interrupted &quot;You pardon your highness, but this is a story I have not heard. Could I trouble you to elaborate?&quot;
Amrik grunted &quot;My lady, in private, with my friends, I would prefer to be called just Amrik. 'Tis a somewhat long story, and no doubt prospero could tell it better, he has a silver tongue. If you will accept me telling it plainly, then I will tell it.&quot;
Nalini and i already knew this from prospero, but we thought it would be interesting to hear the king's own version.
Ra'anor replied with a smile &quot;Amrik, use no titles to me in private either. I am Ra'anor.&quot; She pronounced her name with a glottal stop, like the apostrophe in li'l, approximately rah-ahnor, only with shorter vowels.
Amrik repeated her name correctly, whereas most people seem to mispronounce it as Rahnor. &quot;Very well ra'anor, I am a commoner at heart, I speak with a commoner's words, and with a commoner's distrust of nobles. It seems to me that behind every noble house was an ancestor who was a brigand. The old king was nothing better, and in many ways worse. No one was safe from his perverted lusts, neither young nor old, neither male nor female, not even the beasts in the field. They say he bathed in the blood of virgins to preserve his youth, and used their skins for his parchment. Certainly we found human skins in his quarters, and knives with handles made from human bones. But I get ahead of myself.&quot;
He took a long swallow of wine, then started. &quot;I was born in the northern reaches of aquilonia, one of the mountainous regions that borders the land of the picts. They are a tribal people, quite barbarous, but in my father's day their king of kings united them into a nation called Brythunia. They have raided the border regions for centuries, but when they became a nation, they sought to create an empire. Our village changed from Aquilonian to Brythunian at least three times while I was a child.
&quot;I was about eight or nine when raiders came to my village, they killed every male, they killed most of the children, and all the older women. They young pretty girls they carried off. I was hiding in my father’s workshop, and I saw them killed. They killed my father, they killed my mother, they killed my brothers, and they raped my sisters and carried them off. I was hiding in the rafters watching. But then they set fire to the place, and I had to flee. I was lucky to escape. I fled into the forest, and I was all alone.
&quot;For years the one thing that kept me going was the thought of finding those responsible and wreaking revenge. But by the time I became king I wanted to stamp out such goings on, and make the world safe for everyone. I’ve caught quite a few brigands in my time, and left their heads on poles as warnings to others.
&quot;I knew a bit about hunting, enough to keep myself alive for a few weeks until I came upon a band of wandering gypsies. They took me in and cared for me until I was about thirteen or fourteen. We traveled many places in that time. Then I left them to join a band of mercenaries, and headed further east for a few years. I saw a lot of fighting - that’s what people hire mercenaries for, and I became skilled with many weapons. But one day I decided to go back to Aquilonia. I believe that our god Mithras put that idea into my head, because much has flowed from that decision.
&quot;I joined a different band of mercenaries and we hired ourselves to the king of Aquilonia. Our company was put under the command of duke Leto, and I came to know his sons Baolo and Prospero. Baolo and I were about the same age, and duke Leto believed his sons should earn their position in his army. Baolo apparently told his father about me, and the next thing I know, the old duke offered me a commission in his army. He even put his second son Prospero under my command to learn his trade as a soldier. Several years passed, during which time Baolo, Prospero and myself worked our way up the ranks.
&quot;Then one day I realized the king, the degenerate Sarono, decided that my village was loyal to Brythunia, and he order it destroyed, along with several others in the area. I lost my father, my mother, my sister, my cousins. The king's own guard did the deed, but Baron Belgardo gave them shelter, and had some of his men show the king's guard where the villages were. 
“That night I sought out Numido myself and slew him
&quot;That led to my arrest and imprisonment. The tyrant himself came to supervise my torment at the hand of his torturers. He even told me he killed most of the young girls he captured after he had used them, and assured me my sisters would have died painfully. I cursed him then, and told him I would send him to hell.
&quot;That annoyed him, and he promised me I would live as long as his torturers’ skills would allow, and that every day would be absolute agony.
&quot;They tortured me for two days straight, but then Prospero and some of the men broke into the palace dungeons, slew the torturers and set me free. They spirited me out of the palace through the sewers, and we made our way to the hills. Prospero told me that Baolo had also been arrested, but the tyrant had killed him already. Duke Leto had taken his family into the hills along with his men and their families, and was planning a coup.
We became outlaws, and our numbers were swelled by survivors from the villages. For two years we moved around, harrying the king's soldiers, catching his tax collectors and emptying their purses, rescuing the columns of young boys and girls sent to the capital to feed his unnatural lusts.
&quot;Then the Brythunians invaded again. I considered an aliance with them, but I am aquilonian, not some savage Brythunian who dresses his hair in blood, and never bathes. So we harried them as well.
&quot;I had a long talk with both prospero and duke leto. The old duke  said to me &quot;Amrik, almost everyone must know the king is not fit to rule. My eldest son was cut down for criticising the king when he was in his cups. When the brythunians have been thrown back, I will take my army and march on Tarantia to depose the king.&quot;
Amrik took another drink, poured himself another. His face was no longer bleak. &quot;That summer we fought a long and hard campaign against the brythunians, and routed them. The king sent more of his best troops, fanatically loyal. The duke stationed them in border guard posts where their energies could be used to protect aquilonia, and not support the king. We were in the region near where my village had been, baron belgardo joined us with his army, and agreed to station troops in a number of border posts that the duke set up. He also offered the duke provisions, and his hospitality.&quot;
Amrik looked around at us. &quot;Although I distrusted belgardo, the duke thought the offer was genuine. He also wished a chance to sound out the baron on his feelings toward the king. So he and prospero, along with the other commanders, accepted belgardo's invitation to dine with him. I refused, and stayed with the main camp. The duke arranged with me that he would either return before midnight, or send a messanger if he was staying the night. About the tenth hour a messanger did arrive saying the duke would stay the night, but he did not use the code words the duke had arranged. I knew then that the duke had been captured, possibly killed.
&quot;I hand picked a group of one hundred volunteers, the best of the men, and we crept into the castle through the drains. We discovered the duke and the others in the castle dungeons, and after a fight, freed them. Prospero told me later that belgardo had been prepared, and after dinner had accused the duke of treason. The duke was badly injured in the fight that followed. I arranged for a small group to escort the duke from the castle, and a second group with instructions to bring the rest of the army. The rest of us went on a rampage. Prospero and i and some of the men fought our way to belgardo's apartments, prospero killed the baron. I cut off his head, wrapped it in the baron's cloak.
&quot;When we got out of the keep, we found the entire castle in uproar, with our men fighting belgardo's men and some of the king's soldiers. Prospero called out at the top of his lungs that the baron had been executed for treason, and to stop fighting. I would have been happy to sack the castle, but I saw the wisdom of prospero's deed. I held up the baron's severed head, and also yelled out, and eventually the fighting stopped. The old duke then rode in amongst the carnage, sitting tall and straight despite his wounds, and told everyone &quot;I promised my men that once we had secured our rear from the brythunians, we would march on tarantia, and depose the king. This night our rear is secure. Those who would join me, stand forth, be you king's guard or balgardo's man.&quot; He had all those who volunteered swear an oath to himself and prospero, then he had all those who did not swear rounded up.&quot;
Amrik was by now staring into the distance, not seeing any of us. &quot;I leaned much about leadership that night. The king's guard who refused to join us were summarily executed. The local lads, many of whom had wives and children in surrounding villages, were given the choice of death, or border guard. They all chose border guards. The local lads might be loyal to the throne, but they would support whoever wore the crown. Then the duke started coughing blood, and we carried him inside. He was still issuing instructions, about garrisoning the castle with local boys who had families to support, about who should be commander of the keep, about how to organize the troops for the march to tarantia.
&quot;Toward dawn, he called all the commanders together. He said &quot;I promised I would lead you to tarantia. I fear however that the gods may prevent me. I have given thought to who should command the army, I believe amrik is the best of my commanders, I would appoint him war leader.&quot; The other commanders all agreed, I don't think any of them wanted the responsibility. He made us all swear fealty to prospero and to see him installed on the throne. After his father the duke, who was cousin to the king, he was the next in line to the throne. Then the duke had us carry him outside so he could see the sun rise. 
“The duke did not die that night, though his wounds had weakened him.
&quot;Prospero sent messages to the neighbouring barons, none joined us, but only one, baron heraklo, joined the king. We fought several battles over the space of five weeks, during which we routed the both armies, and killed baron heraklo, and came to the gates of tarantia. We laid seige to the city, but prospero and i were loath to conduct an actual seige, which would kill many civilians. We did not lose many soldiers during the fighting either, because of the way we planned our campaigns.
&quot;Eventually we surrounded Tarantia. The tyrant had hired all the mercenaries he could find, and we found ourselves facing an army of similar size to our own. We were also facing the feared general Trocero, who had been a general for the tyrant’s grandfather. In his heyday it was said that armies would flee rather than face him.
&quot;But Trocero was a wily old fox. He sent the mercenary general Vizard into the field with all his mercenaries, while Trocero and his Aquilonian soldiers remained in the city. I think Trocero claimed he was too old to take the field - he must have been nearly eighty even then - and his Aquilonians might desert or surrender rather than fight. So we faced Vizard and his thousands of mercenaries.
&quot;That was a master stroke by Trocero - mercenaries are tough fighters, but they fight for gold, and when the going gets tough, they go rather than fight. Our troops were spared the worry they might face their relatives, or kill a fellow Aquilonian. But even so, that battle was a close fought thing.
&quot;Vizard was a seasoned fighter, and sent out his best men to assassinate the duke, who was with his standard on a low hill. I will forever regret that I was not on the hill at that time, for we heard the cries, saw the fighting, and as I spurred my horse up the hill I saw duke Leto fall, and his standard with him. Our troops began to falter, as troops will when their leader falls.

Our troops began to falter, as troops will when their leader falls.
&quot;Prospero was with me as my second in charge. Our troops slew the assassins, and prospero raised the duke’s standard. We propped the duke on some saddles, and put his sword in his hand. He wasn’t dead, but he was bleeding badly. The duke struggled to his feet, raised his sword and said clearly. &quot;Mithras will grant us success. My spirit will follow you into tarantia.&quot; Then he sank to his knees, rammed the point of his sword into the earth, and died, fingers clasped around the hilt.
&quot;None of us was relishing the prospect of hand to hand fighting through the city, but instead general Trocero himself rode out to greet us. He offered us the keys to the city, and told us that the remaining mercenaries were barricaded in the palace along with the tyrant, but that the rest of the city was ours. He had troops on every street to guard against pillaging and to reassure the citizens they were safe.The high priest of mithras joined us, along with many other priests, giving the blessing of the gods to our cause. We came to the castle proper with no fighting at all.
&quot;The high priest called on the gate guards to open the gates, saying that mithras had condemned king sarono as an abomination and anathema, and had ordered him deposed. Someone on the gate tower shot an arrow at the high priest, but it stuck in his gold breastplate. The priest cursed the soldier, and a moment later he fell from the tower and was killed. I think the heart went out of the palace guard after that. The small postern gate opened, and a number of the guard came out to surrender. We disarmed them, and then fought our way through the postern gate. Soon the main gates were opened, and the surviving guards at the gate surrendered. We marched into the palace with little resistance. We found the king in the throne room, surrounded by his fanatics. Many a good soldier died capturing the king. I wanted to kill him there and then, but prospero advised that we take him prisoner, and have him tried for his crimes. This we did.&quot;
Amrik took a deep breath. &quot;We captured the king, his advisors and toadies, plus his inquisitors and the palace guard. We convened a court, with myself, prospero, the high priest, the army commanders, and the other barons, and tried the king and the others. Many of the palace guard pointed out that their duty was to protect whoever wore the sun crown with their lives. In the end most of the surviving palace guard was pardoned, but the king, his inquisitors and torturers and many of his advisors were condemned to death. I had the pleasure of personally beheading sarono, and we stuck his head on a pike outside the castle gates.
&quot;The barons squabbled about who should be king, Prospero was next in line but he was adamant he did not want to be the sun king. He was content to be head of the house of poitain, and advisor to the king. He insisted that I should be king.&quot; He snorted. &quot;The barons squealed like stuck pigs, but prospero was right, the armies support me, in preference to him. The barons decided that I was preferable to one of themselves, and more civil war. I have no doubt that had old duke leto survived, he would have been king, he was popular, but prospero was younger than most of the barons, and did not have their respect or support.&quot;
He laughed. &quot;So that is my story, of the village boy who rose to be king. That was five years ago now. I knew little of statecraft, but prospero proved a good teacher. He is a good man and an honourable one like his father, and unlike most of the other barons. I often wish i was still just a simple villager, but if I don't do something about the injustices of the country, no one else will. At least as king I have that chance. I may not be a good king, but most of the barons would be much worse.&quot;
Prospero's tale was similar, although he tended to downplay his own role, and agrandize armik's role. If you believe prospeo, the barons had demanded amrik as king.
&quot;Well&quot; ra'anor remarked &quot;that is a tale worthy of a hero. You will make a good king amrik, provided you never forget your roots, and never forget what happened to you village. You must strive to see that things like that can never happen again, although never is a long time.&quot;
Amrik nodded and spoke softly &quot;Thank you ra'anor. I think prospero would make a better king, except he does not want it.&quot;
&quot;Prospero doesn't have the fire in the belly that you have, friend amrik.&quot; i remarked. &quot;I know he is smart and knows more about politics and so on, but he isn't ruthless enough to be king at this time. He makes a perfect second in charge.&quot;
Amrik looked at me with surprise. &quot;I hadn't thought of it in those terms, but that is exactly how I see him. People like him, but he is not his father, he cannot inspire them to follow him into battle the same way. He is a little fussy about necessary killing. Mind you, at the time of the king's execution, I could not see the need for the trials. I would have been happy to have all of them summarily executed and be done with. Now I realise that his desire for what he called a lawful transition of power was correct - after all, technically we were all guilty of treason. As best we could we had to act within the law, and by involving all the barons in the decision, none of them could later claim that we were guilty of treason, but he was not, and so lay claim to the throne.&quot;
He paused and looked thoughtful. &quot;I do not think I shall ever forget my village.&quot; Then his voice hardened. &quot;Also I shall never forget the king's torture chambers, and the poor victims we found there, dreadfully maimed and in terrible agony, or the drinking cups made from human skulls, the lamp shades made from human skin, and other artifacts made from human remains. We burned them all on a funeral pyre, so their spirits may at least find peace. My one regret is that the king and his torturers died swiftly. We did not burn them, instead we exposed their corpses on what is now called the field of blood, for the wild animals to eat. May their spirits be forever tormented!&quot; He glared angrily for an instant, then recovered.
&quot;We have decided that we should curb the power of the king and the nobles, try to avoid the excesses in future. That is where the parliaments come in.&quot; He looked to enyil.
She explained &quot;The idea is that there will be three lawmaking bodies, but a law does not become law unless all three approve the law. They will be the king, the parliament of lords, and the parliament of commoners. The king works alone, although he has advisers to help him. Some he selects himself, some will be drawn from the two parliaments. Those details have yet to be worked out.
&quot;The parliament of the lords draws its members one from each noble house. Normally that would be the head of the house, but the head may send someone else in his stead. The parliament of the lords has existed for a month now. The parliament of the commoners will have its members elected by the commoners, they will serve for three years, and will be paid a salary for that time. The details have yet to be worked out, and the nobles are vehemently opposed to the parliament of the commoners.
&quot;We have been studying different shadows, including your own, for examples of how parliamentary governments are set up. We like your westminster system, but not the fact that the king is a sinecure. We like your american presidential system, but not the fact that everyone including the president is elected.&quot;
&quot;Plus of course&quot; amrik added &quot;we must somehow get the support of the army and the nobles, or there will be another civil war.&quot;
Durathror shook his head. &quot;We elect our queen, plus her council of advisors. The electors are the adult members of our community. Once elected, their word is law, though if we have a bad queen we can convene a meeting of the electors and depose her. That has rarely happened. We have little in the way of armed forces, or police services. We don't seem to need them. Obviously your situation is far more complex. Our people may number only a few thousand all up.&quot;
&quot;And of course, your people have a tradition extending back thousands of years, all your adults are educated, and have a sense of community.&quot; i commented. &quot;Amrik's people are more like ours, many are not well educated, many selfishly look at only their own needs, and ignore those of the community. Parliamentary systems work well provided everyone plays by the rules. As soon as someone brings in a private army, you have trouble. What we've tried to do is to make the army loyal to the government, not individual leaders. But our governments cannot raise the army, and countries where army leaders go into politics always seem to have trouble.&quot;
Amrik nodded &quot;It is not easy is it? At least we can learn from other countries' mistakes and try to avoid them.&quot;
&quot;Who were you thinking of allowing to vote?&quot; nalini asked.
&quot;You may be surprised to know that enyil and i agree that electors should include both adult men and adult women. I know the custom here is to assume that women are good for nothing other than looking pretty, and taking to bed, but in my village the women often had more say than the menfolk on the day to day running of the village. What we are not sure on is how far to extend it. Many people here cannot read or write, but I do not think that makes them stupid.&quot;
Enyil added &quot;The barons want it restricted to rich landowners, and men only. I believe we should exclude those who are stupid, but what do we do about those who are uneducated? How can they make informed decisions?&quot;
Nalini chuckled &quot;That's just part of the election process - explaining policies to the voters. I agree with amrik, most of them aren't stupid. You should exclude the ones who are mad, and maybe those who are drunk? But consider this, in the shadow where danny and i live is a country called New Guinea. They have a parliament elected by all the adult population, yet most of the adult population can neither read nor write, and many of them have never been outside their own village. Their grandparents were headhunters and cannibals, with each village warring on its neighbours. Yet they vote, they have a workable government. I think it will work here quite well.&quot;
I added &quot;The main thing I see is communications. You can elect the government, but you may need to have smaller regions with local councils to oversee the day to day running of things, rather than continually defer all decision making to a central authority, and have the process take days or even weeks.&quot;
They both nodded. Amrik replied &quot;That is a good point. Each village could have its head, each group of villages its council, but with the same laws appying. It will still take some organization though.&quot;
&quot;Actually, one more point on that - you need to set up a system across the entire kingdom that will ensure that letters and parcels can be delivered to the right place and quickly.&quot; We got into a discussion about postal services, including things like the old Royal Mail with post houses every few miles to permit changing of horses.
Amrik replied &quot;We do have something like that, but it has been used only for the king, the barons and the generals. It only goes to major cities.&quot;
&quot;You should also consider treaties with your neighbours to allow passage of mail with them as well. That's probably not as important though.&quot;
Amrik looked thoughtful. &quot;I need to talk with my advisers. You should have brought prospero. Nemedia, Argos and Zingara are our main trading partners. They might be agreeable. We also have ambassadors from Corinthia, Ophir, Vanora, Masala, some smaller eastern countries I cannot now remember, and of course the huge Turanian empire that borders the inland sea far to the east. We will set up our own service first, but we need to think about exactly how this will work. Nemedia certainly has spies here, its king was friendly to the deposed king, not myself. He would look for any opportunity to cause trouble. Turania too has spies, and the Iron Emperor would certainly love to expand his empire westwards.&quot;
&quot;Trade and treaties can certainly help prevent war, but spies and a strong army will help.&quot; I was thinking about things prospero had told me. &quot;You need good roads so you can move the army about quickly, you need good communications so you know what is happening in distant places, and the army should be centrally controlled by good generals who are loyal to the government. If you have a lot of smaller private armies owned by the barons, then barons can be bought by neighbouring countries, and many of them may not fight if the trouble isn't in their back yard. And your soldiers should be professionals, who are paid by the government, and are willing to move anywhere around the kingdom.&quot;
Amrik was nodding as i spoke. &quot;The king's army is professional, and paid for from the treasury. Its officers and men are trained, no noble can simply buy a commission. Most of the men are loyal to me personally, and to the throne. But currently most of the barons have private armies; we are considering what we can do about that.&quot;
Enyil added &quot;In the system we are setting up, the king will always be the head of government, the commander of the armed forces.&quot;
Amril chuckled &quot;I have been considering appropriating each baron's private army, and amalgamating it with the king's. The barons will still have to pay for their private army, and in return they will receive an equal number of king's troops. Some of the soldiers will be their own men, but many will be from somewhere else, so their loyalty will be to their king, not their baron.&quot;
Enyil added &quot;We are also looking at creating a police force. Currently we have a city watch in each city, plus the palace guard in Tarantia. Soldiers of course are trained to fight and follow orders, not to solve crimes or perform community policing duties. Amrik has learned the difference, but before we can set up a police force we need to have police training centers, which means we need to develop our training courses. It is never ending!&quot;
Amrik nodded good naturedly &quot;I've always thought that community policing was the same as the city watch, which is made up of older soldiers. Enyil took me on a tour of six shadows to see for myself how police worked. I can't say I know a lot about it, but I can see how it is different from the city watch. We are thinking of hiring people from several shadows to set up our fledgling police accademy.&quot;
&quot;A police force is very necessary for protection of the public, the prevention of crime and for solving crimes. The army should be for the defence of the realm, and maybe putting down riots. They can act as deterrents to crime, but they lack the training to solve crimes or catch criminals. You need a good police force, but you will have to start with the watch. Good police take time to train, I'm sure you know&quot; nalini stated.
Amrik nodded, waving his wine cup around. &quot;Enyil thinks we should start an entirely new force, I am for training the watch and using them. What do you thing?&quot;
Nalini shrugged &quot;It probably doesn't make all that much difference, provided the watch don't lose their jobs. Then again, not all the watch may not be suitable for policing jobs.&quot;
I added &quot;Starting a new force has the advantage of a clean slate. You can start new traditions and customs, and do away with old ways. Actually, you should have a talk to young liz when we bring her here, her people have set up their own police assistants - they are not fully trained police, but members of the local community with a uniform and some training. They perform some of the functions; that may be a way of getting started quickly. Set up a force, train them for a month or so, then put them to use. You can continue their training as they work, and as they find out what works best. Maybe you can then include the watch, even if most of them do little more than patrol the streets like they do now.&quot;
We spoke for several hours, far longer than we expected to stay. Amrik wanted us to stay, but we had to return the truck. He seemed in good spirits, and now that much of the day to day running of the realm was delegated to others, he was free to concentrate on policy making, questions of equality, and to enjoy himself from time to time.
                                    ***
On our return journey durathror suggested that both prospero and paula should be allowed to practice their shifting on the way back to tarantia. &quot;It seems a fairly straight forward journey, and I believe they both have the necessary skill levels to handle it. You and nalini will need to keep an eye on them though. If you like, ra'anor and i will take the dog.&quot;
I was starting to reaslise how nalini had felt those first few times when I tried shifting us on my own. With an inexperienced shifter there is always a risk of selecting a dangerous shadow. &quot;Maybe you should take liz as well? Or perhaps we take liz and the dog, and you guide prospero and paula?&quot;
&quot;But that is precisely what we have been doing. We feel they are no longer dangerous, but in need of practice. We will take liz if she wishes, but she may be happier with the four of you.&quot;
&quot;Except that she may not be happy with some of the shadows in which we find ourselves.&quot; nalini remarked.
Ra'anor laughed. &quot;If she wants to learn, she should start as everyone else has. Perhaps atlendor may be free soon, and can start teaching her.&quot;
Durathror added &quot;She is not yet advanced enough in dreaming. But I will enquire with my sister imladril about a torc for her. These things cannot be rushed.&quot;
                                ***
Paula was excited about the prospect of shifting all the way to tarantia, prospero nervous. Liz was simply excited at the chance of going to a royal wedding. She was quite happy to come with the rest of us.
We would be walking, for exactly the same reason that durathror and ra'anor were taking the dog with them: with prospero and paula shifting, we were at risk of walking into odd shadows that could spook the horses. There always was a risk of this, but much lower with experienced shifters.
Walking meant that we were restricted in what we could carry, but the bulk of what we wanted to bring with us we would give to druathror and ra'anor, who would take our luggage on a pack animal or two.
Liz brought her luggage with her that day, on the understanding that she would stay the night. Durathror and ra'anor arrived in the mid afternoon, bringing with them atlendor. He stood tall and proud, honey skin, tribal tattoos and blond hair in beaded braids. I presumed he was shape shifted, because he should be no taller than durathror and ra'anor with green eyes. Previous times we had seen him he had been pale skinned with dark hair and eyes, so it was difficult to be sure.
They grabbed a bite to eat, loaded the pack horses, and then departed down the road. Liz asked &quot;Is that tall guy the same race as durathror?&quot;
&quot;I'm not sure. I know atlendor is kin, but i have never met either of his parents. Don't forget the viharani comprise a number of different races. You just have to look at ra'anor.&quot;
She nodded. &quot;He's a bit of a spunk actually.&quot; Then she giggled. &quot;Do you think there'll be a chance to talk to him at the wedding?&quot;
&quot;More than likely, we're going to be there for a few days. As far as I'm aware, he's unattached, so he might be interested in talking with you as well.&quot; We didn't mention that it was quite likely that if they hit it off, atlendor would assume responsibility for her initial tuition.
After dinner we shocked liz by bringing out weapons and armor. We'd fetched her a ceramic mail jerkin, and had her try it on for size.
&quot;What's all this for?&quot;
&quot;Shadow shifting can be dangerous, and it is quite a way to Tarantia.&quot; I held up the mail shirt. It appears to be made from linked rings of white ceramic, on a cloth backing, but there is some seriously high tech stuff behind the scenes. &quot;This is bullet proof, yet it weights about half a kilogram. We probably won't need them, but we'll all be wearing one just in case.&quot;
Liz made a face as if she were having second thoughts about coming, but she tried the jerkin on for size. It fitted reasonably well. &quot;Where did you guys get this?&quot;
&quot;A distant shadow. It's some sort of police anti riot gear, as near as we can judge. Nothing we've tried can cut the links, but when it's struck by a bullet, it stiffens to absorb the impact and spread it over your entire body. We figure it's better to be safe than sorry.&quot;
&quot;Okay, I'll wear it. What's with all the hardware though?&quot;
There were three swords lying beside our packs, one for prospero, myself and nalini. They were oiled and sharpened, ready for use. On the table prospero had spread out newspapers, and was checking the action on a thirty eight special. There were five nearly identical guns, one of each of us, but two for paula, spare magazines, and a number of boxes of bullets. Nalini sat down, spread some more newspaper, and began stripping another of the guns.
&quot;Shadows can be dangerous.&quot; she commented. &quot;We'd prefer to avoid ending up dead, or raped. Liz, can you use a gun, or any weapon?&quot;
Liz thought about it for a moment. &quot;Uh... I've fired my brother's twenty two a couple of times, that's all.&quot;
&quot;Mmm, I'd like you to carry a weapon, but only something you can use. I should have thought about this earlier, we could have given you some training with a pistol. Maybe you should just carry a knife?&quot;
&quot;Maybe she could take one of the rifles?&quot; prospero looked up. &quot;They're a bigger bore, but probably the same principal.&quot;
&quot;They're also heavy.&quot; i commented. &quot;We don't expect trouble, but this is just insurance.&quot; I sat beside nalini, picked up my pistol. &quot;I think you should just take a knife, but if you want a pistol, say so. We've others, there's time to show you how to use it tonight. The most important thing is weapon safety, and knowing which end to point, and where not to point.&quot;
Liz sat beside paula, who was busy loading bullets into magazines. She was carefully checking each one for signs of corrosion, or indications of imperfections that might cause that bullet to jam. Guns can be wonderful weapons but they have the damndest tendency to jam at the wrong moment.
Liz looked across at me with big eyes. &quot;What would I use a gun on? These things won't be much use against wild animals.&quot;
Nalini looked up. &quot;Liz, the most dangerous creature out there is human. You can walk into the safest feeling shadow, only to find there's a linch mob after you because you're black. The gun isn't to kill people, it's to give you the chance to shift out.&quot;
&quot;Or a rape mob.&quot; paula commented without looking up.
&quot;Yes, there are additional risks for females.&quot; nalini replied. &quot;Mind you, there are worse things than rape.&quot;
&quot;Nalini, how can you say that?&quot; paula asked. &quot;I'd rather be dead than raped.&quot;
&quot;Oh, i don't know&quot; nalini answered. &quot;How about being quadraplegic, with your eyes put out, and your tongue torn out, or being smeared with honey and buried up to your neck in an ant nest? It'll take you days to die.&quot;
Paula made a face. &quot;You know what I mean.&quot;
Liz commented &quot;I agree with you nalini. You can survive rape, if they don't rough you up to much. I'm not so scared of death, but injury.&quot;
Paula commented &quot;So how come you two agree? You been raped liz?&quot;
&quot;Paula!&quot; nalini interjected sharply. Then she looked straight at liz, adding more softly &quot;I was raped, I survived, I healed. I won't forget though.&quot;
Liz looked at nalini with wide eyes. &quot;Danny knows about this? He doesn't think any less of you?&quot;
Nalini shook her head. &quot;Yes, he knows all about it, probably more than most other guys would, he shared my memories of it not long after we met. That was deliberate - if it caused him a problem, I wouldn't be here with him. If any guy does have a problem with it, he's a jerk, and not worth worrying about. I don't go around advertising what happened, but i don't hide it either. It's nothing to be ashamed of.&quot; She paused for a moment, considering.
&quot;Liz, we were talking about how shadow shifting can be dangerous. It isn't a walk in the park, but usually it's quite safe. Back when I first learned, I was young and stupid. I travelled a lot by myself. I got gang raped five times before I learned to take proper precautions. Twice were just random bad luck, i was shadow shifting, walking along a road through a forest when some brigands waiting in the trees to waylay travellers waylayed me and raped me. They roughed me as well, and then let me go. I shifted out, but in my panic went straight into a similar shadow, where another gang of brigands raped me. But the other three times were people I knew, in shadows where I was staying, and where I thought I was safe. I'm lucky I didn't die, because one lot did try to kill me. I can now recognize danger more readily, so I avoid it. But like I said, I survived, I healed. There's worse things than rape. But if you want a gun, we'll get you one. You don't have to shoot a rapist, just point in in the right direction and pull the trigger.&quot; She snorted. &quot;Mind you, a shot to the balls, or perhaps a kneecapping, would be a good idea.&quot; She was smiling again.
Paula said in a small voice &quot;Sorry nalini, I can be a bit insensitive at times.&quot;
Nalini grinned an evil grin. &quot;We know paula. But if you've never been raped, maybe you should share some of my memories. It would give you an appreciation of what happens...&quot;
&quot;Uh uh&quot; paula shook her head.
Liz piped up &quot;I survived too.&quot;
Nalini said &quot;I though you might have been. You feel like talking about it?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I guess it's nothing to be ashamed of. Well, I was thirteen at the time, hangin' roun' with a mob on da beach.&quot; She was reverting to slang, indicating she was nervous. &quot;There were some older blokes dere, mebbe twenny or twenny one. Five of 'em took me up the dunes into the bushes, and took it in turns. They was threatnin' ta kill me, i was yellin' at 'em that if they beat me up they'd catch it anyway.&quot; Liz was staring into space, somewhere behind nalini's shoulder. &quot;Dey all did it twice, den dey pissed on me, and left.&quot; Paula caught nalini's look, put her arm around liz.
Nalini commented softly &quot;Don't say any more you don't want to.&quot; She reached over, patted liz's hand, leaving an oily mark.
&quot;It's okay. I went home cryin', me mum straight away asked me if some bloke had raped me. So I cried, an' I tole her who dun it, and she called me gran, and next fing me gran came roun' wiv some of de uver elders, and dey all listened. An' den de nex' day, de elders got de rest of de mob together, an' they brought out de boys what dun it, and they gave 'em a choice - they could each pay me five grand, or they could face a tribal spearing, or me dad an me cousins'd rough 'em up like they dun to me. One chose a spearin', the others tried to run. None of dem coulda paid five grand anyway. The other four got beat up, nothing serious, just black eyes, lots of bruises, and then people held 'em while they all got a spearing as well. We never told the cops or nothing. I don't think any of them ever did something like that again.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;I can understand your cousins beating them up, and I can understand the option of paying you money, but what is a spearing?&quot;
&quot;Tribal punishment. You do something that breaks tribal laws, the usual punishment is one of the menfolk from the victim's family spears the bloke in the thigh. Doesn't kill or cripple, but it sure hurts them for weeks. It's also a public shaming of them. Not everyone agrees with it these days, so the elders often give them an option of getting beat up instead. There's less chance of the cops causing trouble that way too, since spearing isn't approved by most courts.&quot;
Prospero was nodding &quot;Any punishment that prevents someone from reoffending is a successful punishment. You are very brave liz.&quot;
&quot;I felt good about what happened to them! Everyone knew what they dun to me, but they got theirs an' everyone knew about it too.&quot;
Nalini patter liz's hand again. &quot;Thank you for telling us liz. You are very brave. But like I said, it's nothing for you to be ashamed of, we have to stop thinking we should be ashamed. It's the men who should feel ashamed.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;Why do men commit rape? Is it because they don't have a girlfriend, or can't afford a prostitute?&quot;
&quot;It has very little to do with sex.&quot; nalini responded. &quot;It's a power thing. And usually it's someone you know. They decide to put you down, they use their dicks and their fists to try to do that. A female walking alone is a challenge to their power. There's probably a lot of latent homosexuality in it as well. They really get off having sex with their mates, but they can't do that, so they all have sex with the same girl, and watch each other. Most of them can't relate to women.&quot;
Liz commented &quot;I had some councelling after it happened. The councellor said something similar. I felt terrible for ages after it happened, because the whole community knew about it, and some of the kids'd call me names; but I'd call names back, and my mob.. sorry my family were very supportive, but they weren't pitying or anything, it was like &quot;okay, it's happened, but you're still in one piece, and we still love you, so pick yourself up and keep going.&quot;, and eventually i did. I don't think about it now, i don't have dreams about it, usually i don't worry about it, but i haven't talked to anyone outside my family since then.&quot;
Nalini said simply &quot;Your family has a healthy attitude. We should look at it as not much different from say getting beaten up and a broken arm. It happened, we heal, get over it, and go on with our lives. No one here will look down on you or anything. Paula can be a bit insensitive at times, but she's learning. In fact she was very lucky something similar didn't happen to her. It almost did, didn't it paula?&quot;
&quot;Um... yeah, I guess it could have.&quot; She took her arm away, turned to look at liz. &quot;I think you've heard how prospero and i met?&quot;
&quot;Probably not, because that was before I knew you guys could shadow shift. You said prospero comes from europe.&quot;
&quot;Oh, er... yeah. No, the three of us went shadow walking, or rather, danny and nalini went shadow walking, i was just tagging along, like you're gonna be. We stopped somewhere, I went for a walk. Had to pee actually. Next thing i know, these creepy lizard guys jumped me, and i wound up naked in a dungeon, chained up with prospero and amrik. I didn't get raped, but i guess if they'd been human instead of lizards they might have. Danny and nalini had to rescue all of us, it was quite an adventure really. I nearly got killed several times, in fact we all nearly got killed several times. [* See &quot;Shadow of the Serpent&quot; for more details] That made me decide to learn how to use a gun, and self defense. You should too liz. It's usually safe, but not always.&quot;
Liz looked thoughtful. Nalini added &quot;Shadow shifting isn't really any more dangerous than some places here. These guns are illegal here, so we don't carry them around here. There's probably counless other shadows where these are also illegal. Guns don't solve everything either. If you carry one, there's a tendancy to use them to solve sticky situations instead of relying on your wits. We carry them because we all know how to use them. There is time tonight to show you how to use one, although we won't make you a good shot in that time.&quot;
Liz shrugged. &quot;I do know a bit of self defense actually. I started after i got raped. I don't like knives, but a gun might come in handy.&quot;
Nalini and I had finished checking our guns. She put the kettle on, I went to collect some pistols. All our guns are kept out of sight under lock and key. I returned carrying several boxes and put them on the table. Liz was asking &quot;Nalini, I've just had a thought. Those chain mail shirts are from some place that is more advanced than here, so why don't you have any weapons from there?&quot;
&quot;Good question. We never actually visited the shadow, we used our powers to search for chain mail that was light but bullet proof. This we found. To find a weapon, we first need to visualize it,otherwise we cannot find it. One day we should try to find that shadow, and take a look around. I would like to find crowd control type weapons that don't kill.&quot;
I added &quot;It would be good if we could, but a shadow that specializes in crowd control might be a police state that could be dangerous to us. Don't forget our adventures with prospero were only a few months ago. We don't want too much excitement!&quot;
I opened one carton, displaying a gun similar to the ones we carried. &quot;First things first liz. Weapon safety. We need to be sure you won't shoot us accidentally.&quot;
We spent perhaps thirty minutes going through weapon safety and firing drill with an empty pistol; long enough to drink our coffees. Then we adjourned to an empty shadow with sunlight for some practice with live ammunition.
The sky was pale yellow, streaked with orange and brown clouds. The region was fairly open, tufted reddish grasses covering the ground. There was a stand of bottle shaped trees nearby, their broad trunks about three meters hign and one meter wide, each with five or six red feathery fronds standing up another four or five meters.
I put the box containing the gun similar to ours on the ground in front of liz. &quot;Okay liz. I'll get you to try each gun, to see which you prefer. Start with that one. Load it, shoot five shots into that tree over there, and then unload it. We'll all stand behind you. You're on your own. Good luck!&quot;
We stayed parhaps an hour or so, until we ran out of ammunition. By that stage liz could manage to hit the tree four times out of five with the thirty eight like ours, two times in five with the small berretta, and maybe three times in five with the other thirty eight.
Nalini commented &quot;You've done well liz. Now you get to clean the guns.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Uh... my hands feel a bit sore.&quot;
&quot;That can happen. We probably overdid the shooting in our enthusiasm.&quot;
We got back and sat liz down at the table, setting her to cleaning each gun. Paula asked &quot;Which one are you going to choose?&quot;
Liz picked up the berretta &quot;I like this little one the best, but it doesn't shoot straight. I guess i should take that one like yours.&quot;
Nalini chuckled &quot;That little one is suitable to stick in your handbag, but you really can't hit anything more than about five meters away. Take it if you want. We've found this particular model, the stallion thirty eight police special, is the most accurate, and the most reliable. Doesn't come from this shadow either, but we can walk there in about forty minutes. We'll take you there for shooting practice from time to time. It's a fairly close clone of America, almost everyone carries guns, so parts of it can be quite dangerous.&quot;
I laughed &quot;And apart from that, you'll probably love the place.&quot;
                                ***
The next morning we were up not long after sunrise, around five thirty. None of us like alarm clocks, preferring to wake when we are ready. The bedrooms being on the east side of the house usually means we wake with the sun, in late summer that is still quite early.
We ate a hearty breakfast, cleaned up, and set off. Nalini fussed a little, asking questions like &quot;Everyone been to the toilet?&quot;, and making sure we had everything with us.
Nalini and i wore similar back packs, lightly loaded with a change of clothes plus a few necessities like towel and soap. Nalini carries a medical kit, I carry our camera. Our swords are attached to the packs, hilts projecting over our shoulders for easy grasping. We both wear our guns in specially made holsters that resemble bum bags or fanny packs, depending on your country of origin. Worn to the front, they hold the gun itself plus three spare magazines. The guns themselves are loaded, but there is no round in the firing chamber. I wore dark blue army style fatigues with several pockets and a selection of little gadgets, hiking boots, a t-shirt with the chain mail over that. Nalini wore loose black slacks, similar boots, and a t-shirt.
Paula wore black jeans, black t-shirt, chain mail. She wore a long knife on her right hip, one gun in a modified shoulder holster attached to her pack strap, and a second in a special holster like nalini and i wore. Her shoulder holster was designed to prevent the gun from falling out, but unlike our holsters, made for a quicker draw. Grasping the gun handle released the clasp
Prospero wore a sword at his left hip, a dagger on his right, and a gun in a holster similar to the rest of us. He wore new looking blue jeans, hiking boots, mail, and a pair of binoculas slung around his neck. There was a steadying clip that attached to the pack strap should it be needed.
Liz wore faded blue jeans, new looking boots we'd bought her a month ago, and the mail we'd given her. Her pack was new, and she wasn't completely comfortable wearing it. We didn't have another special holster for her, so her gun was in a modified shoulder holster similar to paula's, only slung lower because of her larger breasts.
&quot;All right&quot; nalini remarked &quot;One of you two can start, and we'll change over in about half an hour, or when you feel tired.&quot;
&quot;Let me go first!&quot; paula asked.
&quot;Okay, but we'll be monitoring where you shift to, if we tell you no, don't argue, and don't shift. Let's go out into the street, and head toward the park.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;We'll all stay together. Liz, please keep close to danny or me. The others can find their way home, you can't.&quot;
I don't know why it is, but we always head off toward the park. It's down hill, with views across the valley, and we usually walk the dog that way. Then again, the bus stop is in the opposite direction. We proceeded in a series of small shifts, with a pause between shifts while paula selected the next one.
The sky became a little darker, the houses slightly different, growing more different with each shift. By the fourth shift we reached roughly where the park had been. Nalini and I could still see our own shadow, but then our powers were stronger. Our park was just a flat expanse of green where children played and dogs ran about. This park was larger, with a lake in the middle. I realised that there were no high voltage transmission towers in the distance either.
Paula was doing what we all do, following a line of related shadows in the rough direction of our destination. I could see that the probably line curved away in a few more shifts; she'd have to switch tracks soon. Following a line is usually reasonably safe, but switching to a new track has risks. A shadow shifter can feel if a shadow is dangerous, but this isn't always a hundred percent reliable.
We walked toward the lake, the air growing colder and deeper blue with each shift. The lake developed an island covered with birches and alders in full autumn color. Three more shifts and there was a bridge across to the island, with cars and trucks.
Paula asked &quot;Hey guys, does this curve back, or just keep diverging? Can you tell?&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;Paula, we aren't supposed to tell you about that. This is your practice, you have to do the best as you see fit. But if you are going to change track, just let us know which track.&quot;
&quot;Okay, I guess you're right. As far as I can tell, this line curves away, so I have to change tracks. Lemme think.&quot;
I added &quot;You can discuss it with prospero if you like.&quot;
Nalini and i checked out the choices they discussed. At one point I commented &quot;If that's the same one I'm looking at, I'd suggest you two tke another look.&quot;
Prospero remarked &quot;It doesn't feel right, somehow. That's my impression, but I can't put my finger on it.&quot;
&quot;Hmmm, I agree, but I can't see why.&quot;
Nalini and I consulted mentally. Nalini answered &quot;It's subtle, and not that dangerous, but it isn't a line you want to follow. Paula, take us there to have a look, then bring us back here.&quot;
We shifted to a world with pale green sky and brownish orange clouds. The air smelled strongly of oil, tar and other aromatics. Liz remakred &quot;It smells like an oil refinery!&quot; To me it seemed that if we lit a match, the whole place might explode. We walked across cruddy brown mud, and paula shifted us back to the lake side.
&quot;Ugh! I didn't like that place. Now I know why it didn't feel right.&quot;
We nodded. &quot;Often, the only way to learn is to go to places like that, but be prepared to shiftback again immediately.&quot;
We let her select a different line, and we walked under a yellow sky across a lush green landscape. I noticed my breathing rate increase, indicating the carbon dioxide levels were probably higher. There seemed to be a faint smell of sulfer in the air. Somewhere in the distance some animal trumpeted loudly.
There were animal trails to follow, we picked the broadest and set off. Liz asked &quot;Is this place dangerous?&quot;
&quot;We're in no danger here, although there are large animals out there that would hunt us. We'll follow this for a while.&quot;
Much of the vegetation was ferns and brackens, but taller trees grew here and there. Many resembled palm trees with darker leaves. We came upon some tracks of large animals. One type looked like an elephant but was about the size of a car tyre, indententations on one side showing vestigal toes. There were several different sized sets with three toes, ranging in size from about a foot long to over a meter long.
Prospero stopped us to study them. Liz commented &quot;They're bloody big animals! What are they?&quot;
&quot;You took the words right out my mouth.&quot; Prospero replied. &quot;They are not that fresh, perhaps a day old, but these large ones look familiar.&quot;
&quot;They're probably dinosaur tracks liz.&quot; I commented.
&quot;Kewl!&quot; from Liz.
&quot;Oh Gawd!&quot; from paula. &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot;
&quot;How can you tell how old they are?&quot; liz asked prospero.
&quot;Well, hunting is still a popular pass time among the nobles back home. It is not something I enjoy, but tracking animals is a skill I have learned. You see how these smaller three toed prints are on top of these large round one? They mean the large ones were made first. There are a number of them, it looks as if two large animals walked this way.&quot; he pointed in the same direction as we were walking. &quot;The edges of the tracks are not sharp, there are puddles of water, my judgement is at least half a day has passed, perhaps a day. There were five, maybe six of these bird footed animals, I think they walk on two legs, i think there are six different sets.&quot;
&quot;Or maybe they have six legs each, and there are two of them.&quot; nalini commented. &quot;We can't assume that animals here have four legs or two just because those back home do. But you are probably right prospero.&quot;
Prospero pointed &quot;See how these round ones are relatively even? The front and back are a similar depth? That is an animal that has four legs, or more. Two legged animals tend to lean forward, so their toe impressions are deeper. I think these pursuers have two legs, they are probably a little larger than we are. The large animals must be massive, at least four times larger than an elephant, possibly as large as ten times the size. I have not seen these before. I think maybe the smaller animals hunted the larger, but they may not be large enough.&quot;
He stood, walked back to the large three toed print. &quot;But these have i seen before. Do you remember those beasts the serpent men rode?&quot;
Liz shook her head. Paula supplied &quot;They look like a T-Rex.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;They can eat a horse in two bites, and can run fast enough to catch one easily. The stride of this one is about four meters, so it probably stands eight or ten meters tall.&quot;
&quot;I hope there isn't one near by. I guess guns won't be much use against them.&quot;
&quot;Nah, but an anti tank missile does wonders!&quot; paula replied. &quot;Let's get moving before it comes back!&quot;
As we regrouped, I remarked &quot;And millions of years from now, archeologists will puzzle over our bootprints!&quot;
Nalini laughed. &quot;They'll probably decide we're some strange kind of animal!&quot;
Paula continued shifting along this line, and after three shifts I spotted a small herd of animals in the distance, cropping the tops of trees. They looked a lot like the large herbiverous dinosaurs, with blimp like bodies, long tails and long necks. Prospero stopped us again so he could study them with his binoculars. He took a photo with a telephoto lens, and then we continued.
Again this line of shadows snaked away, but now we were faced with a bewildering array of strange shadows. Nalini and i agreed on which one we would choose, so we advised paula.
We stepped onto pink gravel under pale pink skies. Here and there were high streaks of yellowish clouds. The wind was cool, blowing from some distant snow covered peaks. There was nothing else in sight, just the expanse of pink gravel blown into dunes. The next shift brought tufts of rust red vegetation, but with the next that became white spikey finger like things.
Then we stopped again, because the nearby shadows all reeked of danger. The shadows seemed similar to the current one, empty deserts. Paula asked &quot;Do we have to backtrack? What's wrong with these ones, can either of you tell?&quot;
Nalini and I stood quite still for a while, using our sorcerous senses to sift each of the shadows around us. &quot;Poison gas. Some of them are low pressure. Okay paula, prospero, sift them, decide which one we should take.&quot;
There was some discussion, because routes nalini and i would have taken were not visible to them. Nalini said to me &lt;&lt;I think we should restrict it to the shadows they can detect. This is good practice for them, if they have to back track, so be it.&gt;&gt;
Prospero announced &quot;Some of the odd ones seem safe.&quot;
&quot;What do you think paula?&quot;
&quot;There are three I can see.&quot; She described them, prospero agreed with her assessment.
&quot;All right, take the second one.&quot; nalini advised.
We walked onto a highly polished metalic surface, silver colored, with regular corrugations that ran off into the distance. A brassy mist obscured the distance. Odd blimp like creatures floated nearby, while a swarm of small silvery insects buzzed around them. Strange plants that looked like messes of brass tubing with offshoots bearing brightly colored ceramic bowls spotted the landscape here and there.
We shifted again and now the sky was silver mother of pearl, the surface regular tiles of silver and gold. Pink crystaline structures grew here and there. A red river flowed down a nearby rise, stepped as if built from large blocks. The river was sluggish and sticky, reminding us of blood.
The next shift was abrupt, silvery blue mother of pearl sky, soft violet colored moss underfoot, green crystal boulders, strange silver trees that tinkled like wind chimes in the breeze. A large slug like creature was seated on what could have been a mushroom five meters wide and four high. It had several branches from the trees in front of it, a hand like appendage holding one against what had to be a mouth, the orange rubbery lips closed on the branch, while something worked behind the lips on the branch inside the mouth. It had four eyes on stalks, two of them swivelled to follow us as we walked past. Prospero snapped a picture; he was using fast film to avoid having to use a flash.
With the next shadow, the moss turned silvery grey, the sky became a copper bowl. There were odd angular bushes that seemed to be made of milky white crystal, and yellow barrel shaped plants covered with bright red spines. Nearby were three huge snail like creatures, their conical shells the color of slate. They seemed to be grazing on the cactus like plants. Prospero took another picture.
Paula announced &quot;I'm tired of shifting. It's your turn prospero.&quot;
&quot;Does anyone want to rest? Or a toilet break?&quot; nalini asked.
There was a chorus of noes, we were walking slowly. Prospero took a different line, branching into a freezing cold shadow, high up a mountain trail. The trail was perhaps two meters wide here, its edge dropping steeply into a ravine where a tiny silver thread ran. The other side of the ravine was much lower, whitewashed stone houses nestled on flatter areas, and terraced crops grew. Dark skinned people in bright colored dresses and shawls tilled the ground. In the distance sharp fangs of tall mountains reared into the sky, snow and ice covering their flanks, and plumes of snow blowing from their crests. Ahead of us was a pale skinned person with long hair, bright red and yellow woollen skirt, blue back pack, walking away from us.
&quot;Sorry!&quot; prospero appologized. &quot;I didn't realize it was this cold!&quot;
&quot;Don't worry, it happens. We can't always pick temperate shadows, we'd be a whole month travelling.&quot;
&quot;Howdy people! Didn't see you below at Ang's place.&quot; a male voice hailed us in american accented english.
We turned to see a sandy haired guy about thirty five, wearing wollen slacks, woollen jumper, knitted beanie, and carrying a huge bright red back pack.
&quot;No, we're with a different group.&quot; i told him.
&quot;Really! It's a great view isn't it?&quot;
&quot;You bet. We were thinking of taking a picture or two.&quot;
Prospero obligingly took out his camera. The guy started admiring the camera, so prospero made his accent heavy. &quot;Sorry, not spik Inlish many. Good camera, yes?&quot;
&quot;Uh yes, good camera. good view. good luck!&quot; he walked on.
We stopped to let him get ahead, and then started walking slowly. More people rounded a bend in the trail about fifty meters behind us. &quot;If we shift now, they'll see us.&quot; prospero noted.
&quot;Do it while they're still far enough away.&quot; nalini replied. &quot;It doesn't matter if they see us, as long as they aren't close enough to be sucked after us. Three or four meters is good enough.&quot;
&quot;It'll give them something to talk about.&quot;
With a swirl of color, the scene shifted. The sky was pale blue, greenish overtones. We were still on a mountainside, but it was warmer. The ravine was shallower, the river broader. On the other side was another village of stone houses with red roofs. In the distance reared tall snow covered peaks. Fifteen meters ahead, our trail headed across the ravine via a rickety wooden bridge suspension bridge. On the otherside a team of what looked like pack yaks were heading onto the bridge, accompanied by an elderly man and a young boy. They both wore brightly patterned clothes, trousers and pullovers.
&quot;I'm not having much luck, am I?&quot; prospero complained.
&quot;Hey, enjoy the view! Don't worry. This is normal.&quot; I tried to reassure him.
Nalini commented &quot;This area and the previous one reminds me of the himelayas. This one, the sky looks like in my home shadow. I wonder?&quot;
&quot;Is there any way to know?&quot; paula asked.
&quot;Probably not unless I'd thought to bring a radio or my mobile phone. I didn't think the bridge would be strong enough to carry those yaks. If we're going to stand here and watch, I suggest we move away from the edge so they can pass on the outside.&quot;
The young boy took the lead, the old man standing beside the bridge, and beating each yak with a stick as it passed. They walked in single file across the narrow bridge, which swayed alarmingly with their passage. Prospero clambered a little up the path to take a photo of them in the middle of the bridge. When they reached the other side, the little kid looked hard at us, but walked on without a word.
Prospero commented &quot;I was going to walk across the bridge and start shifting on the other side.&quot;
&quot;That's fine. In terms of shifting, it doesn't matter, although the shadows are probably different on the two sides.&quot; i remarked.
&quot;That's what we thought. I'm not happy with the shadows i can see over this side.&quot;
The yaks passed us. The old man looked at us, then tugged his forelock. I nodded, prospero touched his forehead. The old man walked on away from us, we started across the river.
Partway across I detected a shadow with an immense bridge, and the shadow seemed to be in the right direction. I mentioned it to the others, they were game, so prospero shifted us.
A rain washed sky, as painted in water colors on wet paper. There were pinks and greens and greys in the clouds, and brilliant yellow gold tops where the unseen sun struck them. An immense bridge stretched away from us in both directions, disappearing into the clouds at either end. It was wide enough for at least six lanes of cars, but the bridge was devoid of any life we could see. It seemed to be made of bronze, but this could not be the case, since bronze could not have withstood the loads. There were huge beams and girders arching up out of a black chasm, in which we could see nothing. The sounds of many people sighing washed up over us from that chasm, along with the occasional groans. The surface of the bridge was roughened metal that rang under our feet.
&quot;I wonder where it goes?&quot; paula asked.
&quot;It might be fun to come back here one day and find out.&quot; I replied. &quot;But it's a long walk to the clouds, so we won't go there today.&quot;
We discussed the sounds we were hearing, but other than the possibility of the wind blowing through unseen structures, we couldn't think of any answer. Prospero took another photo, and we walked on along the bridge.
Somewhere along the bridge it coincided with another bridge, and we switched. This was an older bridge, iron girders and rivets, across a wide brown river. It carried four lanes of fifties style vehicles, a railway line on the further side, and a footpath where walked. It was dusk.
Another switch and it was full dark. Five bright moons hung in the heavens like scattered coins - copper, silver, gold, red and green. This bridge was narrower still, with no overhead structure. The surface of the bridge was wood, and horse drawn carriages rumbled past.
We switched several times, following a cobbled road that lead to a city that reminded me of london, but back in the nineteenth century. We were now in a fairly busy area, where people in period clothing walked about under the light of two large moons.
&quot;I'm going to try for sunlight again.&quot; prospero announced. It was all a matter of selecting the right shadows. Our current one was a more direct route, but it probably didn't matter.
Early dawn on a european country lane, fog on the ground, birds stirring in the hedgerows and trees. Then a green sun peeping over the distant hills, making everyone look billious. Now dirty grey sand, grey water and leaden skies, a cold wind blowing. Several more shifts as the countryside grew greener and wetter. A sudden shower of rain, turning to hail and sleet with the next shift, then back to rain, and finally the aftermath of a storm. The ground squelched.
Next we were walking a causeway over grey sea under leaden skies. The causway seemed to link the green little islands behind us with the mainland ahead of us. The causeway was wooden boards, and wet from the rain. We shifted again to black top on a more modern causeway, red gold sunshine peeping through the heavy clouds. A couple of trucks lumbered past, reminiscent of those back home. There was a whitewashed village nestled around where the bridge joined the mainland, streets radiating out into the incredibly green hills.
&quot;Anyone want timeout? I'd like to walk around the village.&quot; nalini asked. The rest of us were agreeable.
Liz added &quot;I'd like to stop and explore a lot of the shadows we've been through. I wouldn't mind a coffee and something to eat.&quot;
&quot;Liz, nalini and I like to stop in interesting shadows like this, but if we stopped in every interesting shadow, we'd never get anywhere.&quot;
The village wasn't that big, all the shops seemed to be in the main street. The locals looked european, and spoke a quaint dialect of english. So mangled was it that we needed to keep the translation spell in order to understand a lot of what was said. An obliging shop keeper told us the main cafes were down toward the shore, where the old ferry terminal used to be. Nalini bought a couple of postcards and a map, and we walked to the ferry terminal. We found ourselves a picturesque little cafe that served devonshire teas and other goodies, found ourselves a table with views of the islands, and settled down. Surprisingly enough, after an hour of walking we were all hungry, and made good use of the clean toilet facilities.
The map was in english, which made things easy. Translation spells will not work on writing or recorded voices; they need close proximity to the speaker's thoughts. This map showed we were on the largest one of a number of islands called collectively the Oakleys. Britain was a different shape, what passed for ireland was joined by a long spure from what might have been Wales. The islands themselves were to the northeast of scotland, and formed a long archepego running up toward a land mass that might have been Sweden or Norway back home. Interestingly enough, the causeway connected all the islands with Britain (they called it that) and also to Norsland, the country to the northeast.
Nalini commented &quot;These probably are the local equivalent of the Orkneys back home. They are in a similar place, and the name is similar.&quot;
Liz commented &quot;Somehow I thought that if they spoke the same language, the maps would look the same.&quot;
Nalini laughed &quot;Anything you can think of is out there somewhere. Korum used to tell me that. He used to debate with durathror whether they created the shadows by thinking about them or whether they already existed. I don't think either of them understood the concept of infinite. There will be many shadows very similar to our own, and many that are quite different. There will also be a group that are much the same, but with obvious differences. There is a related group that all speak english, but the dialect differs from shadow to shadow. There is an infinite number of shadows, we can never hope to visit more than a small fraction of those.&quot;
I added &quot;So just do what we do, enjoy the journey. Stay places you find interesting, make friends. If you do pass through an intersting shadow on the way to somewhere else, make a point of stopping for a look around, because you may may never be back.&quot;
We all studied the map over our coffees, cakes and devonshire teas, and watched the little fishing boats out in the water. Later the waitress brought the bill: four pounds seven shillings and six pence.
Liz asked &quot;How are we going to pay? Our money won't be any good here will it?&quot;
Nalini smiled &quot;Watch and learn liz.&quot; She had the air of someone about to perform a trick. She took out a wad of assorted notes collected from any number of shadows, peeled off the outer one. It read X Dracma, and was mainly red. She folded it in her cupped hands, closed her eyes for a moment. She opened her hands again to reveal a slightly tatty green five pound note, complete with image of a king on one side.
&quot;How did you do that?&quot; liz was astonished.
&quot;Sorcery liz. One day you will learn to do the same. It's just an application of power to the universe. Or this banknote in this case.&quot;
&quot;Is is legal?&quot;
&quot;Probably not, most countries are very particular about people creating bank notes. I don't think it matters if we are just passing through, but nalini and i don't do it if we're staying somewhere.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Liz, this is a real bank note, which is what I think you meant to ask, but it will be identical with another note somewhere around here, probably in the till. The serial numbers will be the same, so the police or banking officials would conclude that one was counterfeit. It's easier with coins because they don't have serial numbers, and it is more difficult in modern shadows where they have electronic cash. I don't know how to create that.&quot;
&quot;It won't change back to what it was?&quot;
&quot;No, that would be illusion. Illusion is often easier, but that would mean the shop keeper is robbed, because the next day they'd find a bank note from some other shadow in their till. That could cause a few other problems as well! We prefer to move through the shadows touching as lightly as possible, so most people who encounter us won't ever realise we aren't from their shadow.&quot;
&quot;But how did you change a bank note from one shadow so it looks like one from another shadow? I mean, you'd have to change the size, change the color, even change the material. How do you do that?&quot;
&quot;We'll have to teach you, once you have enough power. Neither paula nor prospero can do this yet.&quot;
I added &quot;Liz, it comes under the same category as shape shifting. I'm not going to go into that now, but we don't push atoms and molecules around. Instead go back to the dreaming. Everything is shadows, projections if you like. The sorcery works on the projection, by changing the thoughtform that creates it. The same sorcery that changes a bank note into another can change a human body into an animal or something. Once you realise that this can be done, you have to rethink your concept of the fixedness of the physical world. It is harder to change than a dream, but it is the same mechanism.&quot;
Liz shook her head. &quot;I don't think I understood most of that, but I've changed things in dreams recently, I guess that's what you're talking about.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;I'll wait until you guys teach me.&quot;
After this, nalini paid the bill, and we left. Paula took over shifting again. We walked down the main street, and with each shift we seemed to be going back in time. The old stone cottages and shops looked progressively newer, the ashphalt on the road became bluestone cobbles, the footpath beside the road changed from concrete to ashphalt then to flag stones. The road became grey gravel, and we were suddenly out of the town and walking through green scottish countryside. The grey skies lightened to deep blue, then shaded to lilac.
With abrupt suddenness, we shifted to concrete paving beside a busy street carrying trucks, cars and busses. There was much exhaust smoke, honking of horns, the cars and trucks were mostly delapidated, and could have come from anywhere in the sixties and early seventies. Most of the people were euopean featured, but with yellowish skins. The building were all featureless, grey concrete constructions six or seven stories high.
With the next shift we were walking a stone flagged path through striking dark blue grass in what appeared to be a park. There was a distant hum of traffic, and white stone buildings could be seen rearing over the tops of the trees. The trees themselves were spreading things with large dark blue leaves. Off to our left was an odd structure of metal and concrete. It was difficult to describe, there were bits of concrete daubed on metal pipes, bent wire dangling here and there
&quot;What on earth is that?&quot; paula asked.
&quot;Sculpture?&quot; i hazarded.
Prospero declined to photograph it, so we walked on. Our next shift was an underground parking lot, full of unfamiliar cars, concrete pillars and pipes snaking around the ceiling.
Our next shift took us out onto brilliant emerald green grass, pale blue skies with masses of dark cloud off to out right, and a distant ring of black standing stones on a hill to out left. Three more shifts and the grass was deep blue green, the sky deep purple, and the sun startlingly green. We were nearing the summit of a hill, with three concentric circles of pink standing stones that almost glowed in the sunlight.
&quot;Hey! wow! Doesn't that look great!&quot;
&quot;The stones don't look weathered. I'd say they are fairly recent in this shadow.&quot; I remarked.
&quot;So that village down in the valley is probably where the caretakers live. We shouldn't stay for a picnic.&quot; nalini announced.
We looked where she was pointing. Perhaps half a kilometer away a stream ran between rocky banks. On a flatter area was a village of perhaps thirty small huts arranged in a three quarter circle, with a wooden palisade around. With prospero's binoculars, I could see that the people within the village were clad in clothes made from the skins of brown and white spotted animals, that they had thicker bodies than humans, and that their faces resembled those of pigs, with snouts and tusks on some of the larger ones.
The rest of us were a little blase, after all you can see all manner of strange creatures in shadows. Liz however almost squealed &quot;Oh my god, the have faces like pigs!&quot;
Nalini remarked sardonically &quot;And they probably find us just as ugly. There are many variations on humans, many of them we'd regard as crosses between humans and animals. Some are friendly, most are wary, some are actively hostile. We won't stay long. Take some pictures prospero if you like, and we'll move on. I'm sure none of you want to find out whether those people are friendly.&quot;
&quot;Nalini, does it seem to you that the shadows seem to twist and swirl around those stones?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Yes, I see what you mean. There is some sort of power here that is affecting shadows. I think we should be careful, and go around it. Oh no!&quot; Liz had just walked through the first ring, and was approaching the second. &quot;Liz, how do you feel? Did you notice anything strange?&quot;
Liz turned in the process of walking through the second ring, moved into it, then replied &quot;Yeah, I felt a tingle both times I crossed a ring. The second one was stronger.&quot;
&quot;Maybe you should come back? There's some sort of power centered here, it might be best to avoid it.&quot;
&quot;It's ok. I won't be long.&quot; With that she turned and walked to the top of the hill, and into the third ring. Nalini and I decided to investigate the sensation she had felt, and hand in hand we walked through the first ring. It was almost like the sensation of stepping through very cold water, but passed in an instant. I felt refreshed, cleansed. The same happened with the second ring.
As we approached the third ring, we saw that Liz was talking with a what appeared to be a dark haired male who was standing beside a stone block. He wore a grey pelt around his loins, and a wolf skin tied around his neck as a cloak, the head forming a cap. In his left hand he carried a flute made from bone, and he wore a necklace of teeth. There were tribal tattoos on his arms and legs.
We hurried up the hill and through the third circle. The figure turned his head to regard us with piercing blue eyes. His face was long, his nose narrow. He was clean shaven.
&lt;&lt;Definitely not one of the locals.&gt;&gt; I thought to nalini. &lt;&lt;I hope he's friendly.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I'm sure he wasn't there before. Is it possible he shifted in?&gt;&gt; she thought back. &lt;&lt;He seems friendly enough.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;But if he shifted in he's a sorcerer, that has to make him dangerous.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Maybe we shuld start with appologising for invading this sacred area?&gt;&gt;.
We spoke in unison, something we tend to do almost without thinking, since we are telepathic with each other. &quot;We appologise for invading your sacred area. The girl is in our care...&quot;
&lt;&lt;...and you merely seek to ensure that no harm befalls her.&gt;&gt; His words echoed in out mind. His mouth did not move.
&quot;Oh I'm sorry, I should have realized this is a sacred site. Can you forgive us for intruding on sacred ground?&quot; Liz spoke.
&lt;&lt;Commendable sentiments. Appology accepted. None of you could have entered here without my approval.&gt;&gt;. He turned to liz, beckoned. &lt;&lt;Come girl, join your friends.&gt;&gt;. He turned back to us. &lt;&lt;As you can see, no harm has befallen her. Two who would be sorcerers, and their three pupils. You are far from home. What do you seek here?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Let's hope he stays friendly.&gt;&gt; i thought to nalini.
We spoke again in unison. &quot;We seek nothing here, we are passing through on our way to a distant realm. But you are right in your assessment, we still have much to learn.&quot;
A hint of a smile was playing round his lips. His eyes seemed to twinkle. &lt;&lt;Are you of one mind, or do you seek to impress me?&gt;&gt;
&quot;We are often of one mind....&quot; A tangle of thoughts. We have been telepathic with each other since nalini attuned me to my torc, but while that happened with paula to some degree, and prospero even less, our link was far stronger. There are times when we seem to be but two halves of some greater whole. When we shadowshift, we normally link minds, sift shadows together, and generally share thoughts. We were in this state now, which meant that to an observer we didn't talk much with each other, but then we didn't need to, we were in continuous communion. We spoke to paula, prospero and liz, since the telepathic link hardly existed with them.
He finally smiled. &lt;&lt;You should know that your thoughts are as plain as speach to me...Welcome...&gt;&gt;.
&quot;Is this a private party or can anyone join?&quot; paula asked. She and prospero had just entered behind us, and moved over to us. &quot;Hi, who are you? Isn't the view marvellous from up here?&quot;
&quot;Paula, can you show some respect? This is a sacred place.&quot; I told her.
&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;Is there anything special we should do to show our respect?&quot;
&lt;&lt;As long as you are aware, and are respectfull within yourselves, that is sufficient.&gt;&gt; the stranger said.
Nalini introduced us &quot;This is liz, paula, prospero, I am nalini, my partner is danny.&quot;
&lt;&lt;Ah, you do not fear to give your names. But they mean nothing. I am called Prowling Wolf. I shall give you better names.&gt;&gt; He pointed to me. &lt;&lt;I name you soaring eagle.&gt;&gt; He pointed to nalini. &lt;&lt;I name you stalking jaguar.&gt;&gt; He pointed to paula &lt;&lt;You I name running fox.&gt;&gt; He pointed to prospero. &lt;&lt;You I name laughing wolf. I bid you return here in dreaming. You I will teach.&gt;&gt; He turned at last to liz. &lt;&lt;You I name sea eagle.&gt;&gt; He turned back to nalini and myself. &lt;&lt;Laughing wolf I will become mentor to. The rest of you must find your own. Return here in dreaming, it may be that others of my group will also be here, and one of them may select one of you. For now, all of you watch me closely, there is one thing i will show you.&gt;&gt;.
He turned, walked away a few paces. In one step his form flickered into a black bear. There was a gasp from liz. Nalini and I were watching the lines of force around the figure with our sorcerous sight. In a second pace he flickered again and became a loping wolf. The wolf turned to face us, became a man with a wolf skin cloak again. &lt;&lt;Who among you saw what I did?&gt;&gt;
Paula commented &quot;We all saw you become a bear and then a wolf. Was it illusion or or did you really change, like nalini changes money?&quot;
Nalini thought to me &lt;&lt;That is what durathror promised to teach us one day.&gt;&gt; Aloud she said &quot;It was real, like the money paula.&quot;
I added &quot;Nalini and I could see what he was doing. The viharani can do the same.&quot;
&lt;&lt;A good start. Who among you can repeat what I demonstrated?&gt;&gt;. He was looking at nalini and me expectantly.
&quot;We can't do that!&quot; Paula responded.
&quot;Paula.&quot; I said in a warning tone. She looked at me and quietened down.
&lt;&lt;Do you think we should try?&gt;&gt; I thought.
&lt;&lt;We saw what he did with the energies. It is the same as the money trick, only bigger.&gt;&gt; she thought.
&lt;&lt;And of course we're experimenting with ourselves.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;It's probably safe enough. We need to picture what we want, just like the money. I think we know how to do it, but I'm not sure if either of us have enough energy.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Shall we try?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Yes. Together?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Together&gt;&gt;
&quot;Okay&quot; We began shucking our packs.
Paula commented &quot;You guys aren't going to try are you?&quot;
&quot;Its one more step along the road to knowledge. You lot aren't powerfull enough, and you don't know how. We think we know how, but we're not sure if we have enough power.&quot;
We stood together, and linked minds. It's a sort of nebulous state where individual awareness fades. We can have no secrets from one another in this state. Many people could not handle such. But somewhere down underneath is a well of power we can tap into. We'd done something similar while nalini was teaching me shadow shifting.
&lt;&lt;Shall we try for a wolf?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Wolf seems good. We saw him do that.&gt;&gt;
To feel the energies that flow from the ground and from the sky, the energies of the winds, the energies from the torc and from that other place is to feel alive. We do this in shadow shifting all the time, but this time we needed to turn inward, so manipulate the image we present to the world. We stood there for a time, gathering energies, organizing our thoughts. Mine and hers evaporated; there was an itching in our belly, our knees, little feet were running down our spine. And then suddenly it was as if some halucinogenic drug hit us. The outside world swirled in a vortex that was ourselves, and i was on four legs, looking up at prowling wolf.
Paula yelled something unintelligable. Nalini was there beside me, a wolf, standing, turning her head to look at me, just as i turned my head to look at her. &lt;&lt;We did it!&gt;&gt;.
There was a world of scent assailing my nose, a world I had never dreamed of before. My scent, sort of bluish with gold overtones, nalini's scent, sort of brighter, greenish with golden undertones, the grass, a different green scent, the strong pungent odours from paula and prospero, colored red from their meat diet, somehow reminiscent of bacon, a lighter though similar scent from liz, who ate less red meat, while from the wolf man was a grey blue odour with darker streaks, a scent that said wolf. Nalini and i exclaimed in wonder to each other as we identified each scent.
&lt;&lt;Very good. Now walk over to me. Do not think about it, just do it.&gt;&gt;.
To think about walking was to wonder how to move with four legs. We were both paralised for a moment before we trotted over to the wolfman.
&lt;&lt;Good. Now follow me. This will not take long.&gt;&gt; He became a wolf again, and lead the way through the stones. We loped briefly down the hill, he shadow shifted us twice, quite long shifts, once to green scrub, a second time to dark red earth with sparse eucalypts and bracken. The earth had a rich scent, the eucalypts quite overpowering. A fire was burning, we smelled it before we knew it, and someone was playing what sounded like a didjeridu, accompanied by a harp, and sticks. We rounded a boulder, and there seated on a log was an aboriginal man of indeterminate age, playing a didj. He was naked apart from a loincloth, and his body was painted in white circles. Beside him stood a brown skinned woman wearing only a short skirt made from a spotted pelt, like a leopard or jaguar, playing a five stringed harp made of wood inlaid with gold. She was definitely not aboriginal. Seated on a nearby rock was another woman with pale skin, red hair, dressed in what looked like a skirt made from a reddish pelt. She was beating two sticks together. Another man sitting near her wore a bear skin as a cloak, and beat time on a small drum made from a skull. There were several others that I did not see clearly. None of them smelled like humans.
The wolf man switched back to human form &lt;&lt;Now change back yourselves.&gt;&gt;
It was easier going the other way, as if energy is required to maintain the image, and less for our normal form. &lt;&lt;Like energy states in atoms!&gt;&gt; nalini thought to me. &lt;&lt;There are many stable ones, all but the lowest one require energy to reach, and require energy to move out of that stable state as well.&gt;&gt; It made sense to me at the time.
I turned around and realized that paula, prospero and liz had followed us, prospero and liz holding our packs. They looked a little aprehensive. The wolfman began playing his flute, joining the music the others were playing. They played for several minutes, then as one accord all stopped.
The wolf man introduced us using the names he had given us, so i presume he had brought the others with us. The man with the didjeridu stood, walked around us almost glaring at us. He reached out, touched me. &quot;Hah! You I shall teach. You will know how to find me.&quot;
The dark skinned woman beside him touched nalini. &quot;I shall be your mentor.&quot;
The red haired woman walked over to paula. &quot;You will be my pupil.&quot;
The aborigine looked around at the others. &quot;No one for the young girl?&quot; He walked over to her, studied her intently. She stood quietly under his scrutiny. &quot;You are of my people!&quot; he exclaimed exultantly. &quot;I claim you too.&quot; He threw his arms around her and hugged her briefly.
He returned to his seat by the fire, looked us over. &quot;So, in dreaming you will find us. Sometimes we will seek you out. You are on the path of knowledge, you have a long way to travel. Now, let us not detain you longer. You have things to do. Goodbye.&quot;
The wolfman gathered us with a wave of his hands, and lead us back to the hilltop, this time outside the stone circles. &lt;&lt;This is my place of power. In the future there may be occasions where you need a place of refuge. You will find it here. No doubt your mentors will show you other refuges. Now it is time for you to go.&gt;&gt; He turned to nalini and me. &lt;&lt;You two did very well. Do not forget what I showed you, do not forget what you did. There will be times with you will need such a skill.&gt;&gt;. He became a wolf, loped up the hill and into his place of power. His thought lingered &lt;&lt;Goodbye, and good hunting!&gt;&gt;. He faded out.
Nalini and I shouldered out packs and started walking down the hill. &quot;Let's get on our way. Whose turn is it to shift?&quot;
Prospero volunteered &quot;I think it's mine. Are you two okay?&quot;
Paula added &quot;What was all that about? Do any of you guys know? Who were those strange people?&quot;
Liz commented &quot;Danny, you remember some time back you asked me what I thought sorcerers looked like, and I said scarey old men and women? Well, those people look like that.&quot;
Nalini turned to talk. &quot;Liz, why did you walk up the hill away from us like that? Getting separated from the rest of us could be dangerous. If the wolfman hadn't been friendly, it would have been dangerous.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I know. I've been thinking about that. I really don't know, I just wanted to go up the hill. I'll try not to let it happen again, okay?&quot;
&quot;It's okay. He probably summoned you anyway, probably there wasn't anything you could have done.&quot;
The blue grass had lightened, the hills had shifted and grown rocky teeth, a paved road ran before us. The flag stones were irregular crazy paving style, there were grooves from cart wheels, and the odd weed grew here and there. The road was wide enough for seven or eight of us to walk abreast.
&quot;Powerful sorcerers is right, but beyond that, neither nalini nor i have any idea who they are or what they want beyond what they said.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;Liz, what did he say to you before we arrived?&quot;
&quot;Oh, nothing much, maybe something like &quot;greetings girl, you are a long way from home&quot;, and I told him i was following you mob, and i had no idea where i was, and then he asked me if i was studying sorcery, and i was sort of telling him i'd started, and asking who he was, when you two arrived.&quot;
&quot;I wonder what they're going to teach us?&quot; paula asked.
&quot;Well&quot; nalini replied &quot;That was shape shifting. It's something imladril promised me she would teach us when we were ready, but she hinted that it might take years. Danny and I are aware of the basic principals, they are the same behind all sorcery, but we'd never gone beyond money. We never thought we could. It is something that is open to a lot of abuse if you think about it.&quot;
&quot;Hey, yeah!&quot; paula replied. &quot;Just think - you could change the way you look, commit any crime, and get away with it!&quot;
&quot;I'd say that with sorcery you can commit crimes and get away with them anyway.&quot; I responded.
&quot;There are lots of shadows where sorcery IS a crime!&quot; nalini added sardonically.
&quot;I think we should discuss those people with imladril and durathror, see what they advise. We don't know what their hidden agenda is.&quot; I always assume people have a hidden agenda, I usually try to find out what that is.
We debated about the strange sorcerers for some time, stopping for lunch in a city cafe. The sun was shining redly in a pink sky. The breeze was chilly. We were walking through a paved outdoor mall, shops and cafes spread on both sides and down the middle. The patrons sat at pavement side tables, but in most cases there were large transparent blinds to keep the breezes out. We selected a more upmarket one that probably catered for tourists, this one had heaters installed on poles to keep patrons warm.
Most of the people wore heavy coats, had pale skin and almond shaped eyes. Most had dark hair, although some had really pale blond hair. Our odd looking clothes occasioned stares, nalini and liz felt that their dark skins also attracted attention. The stares weren't too bad though, we generally stop in places where people seem similar to ourselves. There are many places where people aren't quite human, we would stand out there as obvious aliens, so while we may pass through, we will not stop.
However, the food was excellent, and out of the wind the seats were warm enough. We couldn't read the menu, so we had to get the waitress to tell us what was on. We placed our orders, the waitress went away.
Liz changed the topic from the sorcerers. &quot;I've been wondering. People look at us funny sometimes, but no one seems to notice our weapons.&quot;
&quot;How do you know they're not just being polite?&quot; prospero asked.
&quot;People tend to see what they expect to see. Our guns aren't that obvious, even yours in its shoulder holster looks more like a piece of hiking equipment...&quot;
&quot;I still think we should get you girls less obvious holsters.&quot; I put in. &quot;It's a bit of a detour today, but we might make a side trip once we get to Tarantia, get some more of these holsters.&quot;
The others nodded. Nalini continued &quot;In civilized societies, people don't carry weapons, so they don't expect to see them. Those who do probably assume we're entitled to, or we're some sort of theatrical group. With these mail jerkins we look a little like some group that specializes in medieval pageants. Now that prospero has put his on his backpack, we don't look like we are actually wearing swords, just carrying them around. If a cop stops us, we'll deal with that then.&quot;
&quot;A gun is easy to conceal, as is a knife, but what practical use is a sword?&quot; liz asked.
Prospero chuckled. &quot;Guns run out of bullets, swords don't. Ask nalini about that. Less advanced civilizations don't know what a gun is. Most of them can recognize a sword as a weapon. I think you'll find if we go to those sorts of places that people will recognize we are carrying weapons, but then so will many others.&quot;
&quot;And there are shadows where guns just don't work. The laws of physics are sufficiently different that the cartridge doesn't explode.&quot; i added.
Liz looked puzzled. &quot;Yeah, I think you said that before. I hear what you say, but I can't see why it should be that way.&quot;
Nalini countered &quot;Why should the laws of physics be the same in each shadow? That's like asking for the land masses to be identical, or the skies to be identical, and so on.&quot; She smiled. &quot;This isn't really an explanation, I don't think any of us know why shadows can have different physical laws, but that's just how it is. If the laws are different enough, your bodies life processes can't be sustained, and you die rapidly. We have to check out each shadow before we shift into it.&quot;
&quot;But how do you see them?&quot;
&quot;Liz, could you explain sight to a blind person?&quot; Liz shook her head. &quot;Right now you are blind to the shadows. One day your sight will be opened, and you will know. There are no words in english, which is why we talk about seeing shadows. We don't really use our eyes, it's more like mental imagery, except that it isn't.&quot;
Liz shook her head again. &quot;You're doing it again, explaining round in circles.&quot;
&quot;Not deliberately Liz.&quot;
&quot;Hey, I've changed a bit, haven't I? From not wanting to be involved with sorcery, now I'm getting impatient.&quot;
&quot;I didn't want to get involved with sorcery either.&quot; prospero remarked &quot;I always thought it was about mumbling incantations to demons, and that most of it didn't work. It wasn't until Amrik, paula and myself were captured and then rescued by danny and nalini that I realized that sorcery is real, and the other stuff is just magic.
&quot;Shadow walking is probably the most interesting and impressive part, but there's many other aspects as well. I saw that with durathror, atlendor and imladril. But why is it that we learn shadow walking before almost anything else?&quot;
Nalini smiled &quot;It's probably my fault. Korum taught me shadow walking, and almost nothing else about sorcery. Imladril and durathror taught me other aspects of sorcery, but I am biased in favor of shadow walking. As you say, it's interesting, practical and so on.
&quot;Simpler and easier sorcery is telepathy, spells of illusion, and some other spells. Telepathy is a two edged sword, you really have to trust the other person, because it is very easy to broadcast more of your thoughts than you would say. That's the main basis behind the translation spell. You and paula should be able to set your own translation spell, but you've had far more practice at shadow walking.
&quot;Illusion is where you make something seem to be something else. Danny and I have set a simple illusion spell that is something like a poor relation to an invisibility spell. People see what they expect to see; our simple spell just builds on that so they don't notice just how strange we look. We could use illusion to make a bank note seem valid currency, but it would wear off later. By the way paula, illusion does not fool cameras and machinery, although you can create spells for that purpose. So if you used illusion to look like liz here, and then robbed a bank say, the security camera would still see you as you are.
&quot;There are other practical sorcery spells that work on enhancing or diminishing what is already there. I'm trying to think of an example. Opening locks, starting fires or putting them out, putting people to sleep so you can sneak past them. They vary in difficulty, but they are around that of shadow shifting, or maybe a little harder, or a little easier.
&quot;Harder spells are those that actually change matter. I mean shape shifting in all its forms: the money changing, what danny and I did earlier in that ring of stones, the instant healing that imladril did on prospero's arm some time back.
&quot;Harder again is spells that create something out of nothing. Korum told me that the beings from the primary shadow can create and destroy shadows. I can't vouch for that, but other examples would be to create food out of thin air, or to create money out of thin air.&quot;
The food arrived at this point. The discussion continued in fits and starts as we ate. Liz asked &quot;What about rain making?&quot;
Nalini shrugged. I answered &quot;I guess it depends on what you have to start with. If there are big storm clouds, all you are doing is giving things a little push. If there's clear sky, then you'd be creating something out of nothing.&quot;
&quot;What about when you produce food out of thin air? I've seen you do that at least a couple of times.&quot;
Nalini sighed. &quot;That's just fetching. It's like shadow shifting, you visualise what you want, except that instead of walking to where it is, you bring it to you. We do it when necessary, but we have reservations about it. We don't create it, we find it off in shadow somewhere. So if we bring that here, we've taken something that belongs to someone else. That's how danny and i see it. Korum sees it completely different, but then he and i disagreed on a lot of things.&quot;
&quot;There's other aspects too&quot; I announced &quot;Like seeing auras. You can tell a lot about a person when you can see their aura, and you can work on their feelings and thought processes. Nalini and I are starting to be able to see auras. I don't think it takes a lot of energy, but it does take practice, like anything else.&quot;
Prospero observed &quot;As I said, I used to think sorcery was mostly useless. Certainly the sorcerers I know of back in my home shadow cannot achieve much. But you two have stumbled onto sorcery that actually works. Now that makes me wonder about its potential for abuse, for committing crimes, and so on.&quot;
Paula was nodding. &quot;Even shadow walking could be used to commit perfect robberies and murders. Are there evil sorcerers out there?&quot;
&quot;I'm sure there are. I know that nalini and i are particular about who we teach - and that's just you three. We know we can trust you, imladril and durathror have vouched for you as well.&quot; I remarked.
Nalini added &quot;We should also tell you that you should not teach anyone unless both imladril and durathror say that you should. And don't let anyone else know that you are sorcerers.&quot;
Paula nodded &quot;I'm sure the pentagon would love to get their hands on us.&quot;
I added &quot;I think you're thinking X-files and conspiracy theories. I'm sure the CIA and similar organizations would love to have their agents trained. It may be that there are shadows where that happens. I don't know. But I think that evil sorcerers have ambitions like anyone else, and they probably move on from petty robberies to much larger crimes. I'd love to think that the training process weeds out the bad guys, like my first karate teacher used to tell us, but that isn't true.&quot;
Liz had been sitting quietly, taking in all that we said. She observed &quot;I've been thinking about everything we've been talking about today. Basically, God as i was taught in school, doesn't exist. Neither does the devil. When we die, we go into the world of dreaming, and later we are reborn. There are beings like gods, and ones like devils, but there is no heaven or hell, there is no punishment or rewards, we just keep on being reborn. Our desires themselves determine who we get reborn as. There's no justice. There is power that can be used or abused. What is the purpose of it all? Where is the meaning in all this? People go around doing their petty little things, is that so they don't feel the terror of existance, the knowledge that there is no purpose to their lives, that it's all empty?&quot;
I responded as best I could &quot;'Vanity of vanities. It is all empty, and a chasing after the wind' Ecclesiastes. It's not quite as bleak as all that liz. Look within, it isn't emptiness you see, but the well of the world, and down below is the mind of god. In a sense, we are all children of god, we are all part of god. We are the eyes of the universe, we see the beauty, the terror, the mystery. Our desires do determine what happens, and where we go, but we can learn to modify our behaviour. We can go through our many lives never learning anything, always repeating the same behaviour patterns, making the same mistakes, wasting our lives, or we can learn from our mistakes, we can learn about the mysterious world out there, we can learn something about its shaping, its workings. Life is an art, it's your work of art. Hell exists, and mostly it's here on earth, but there are hellish places in the dreaming too, we'll take you visiting one day with imladril or durathror. Shakespeare said life was a stage, and we were players, but that isn't quite right, because we can change the script. In a sense life is a game, it has rules, and we agreed to abide by those rules when we came down here in the first place. So we play the game, and we do the best we can, because that is all we have. This is god looking back at his creations, experiencing the dreaming of this world. Life is a school, a journey. It is important that we enjoy the journey, enjoy the game. It doesn't have a point, a reason, and that's its point. It is, it is sufficient for itself. Dreaming in being, and being in dreaming. From one perspective, nothing matters, but at the same time it all matters. I am, I experience, I am aware, I can act, I can learn, I can remember, I can make a difference!&quot; I ran out of words. I reached across the table, took her hand, and squeezed it. &quot;We care about you liz, we love you.&quot;
Liz looked across at me with big soulful eyes. She stared for what seemed like ages, then she blinked. &quot;I could almost see what you were talking about danny. I almost understood.&quot; she looked thoughtful for a moment longer, then explained &quot;I had a black period after i was raped, where i was depressed, and suicidal. I guess i felt that everything was pointless, god didn't care, or didn't exist, i was on my own and had bad luck, couldn't see how to change it. I would have said I grew out of it, but I was thinking about a lot of things, and i got stuck into a train of thought about there being no justce.&quot; she smiled. &quot;That black mood comes back from time to time, but it goes away again just as quickly. Part of me understands what you were saying. I realise now that the universe isn't how they taught me in sunday school, but I don't yet understand how it is, I'm not even sure of what it is. But you and nalini have shown me that in some ways it is a lot closer to what the elders told me about the dreaming. I can understand about life being a bit like a game, but I prefer the idea that it's a work of art, my work of art. I'm doing my best, even if that isn't as good as I want. But I do want to learn what you can teach, I do want to learn what that crazy old aborigine said he'll teach me today. And hey, i love you guys too, okay?&quot;
&quot;Liz, no artist is ever as good as they would like to be, it goes with the territory.&quot; I squeezed her hand again.
Nalini put her hand on top of mine, we spoke together. &quot;We're proud of you liz.&quot; Paula was looking all emotional, as if she were thinking about crying. I let go of liz's hand. &quot;That includes the two of you, paula and prospero, we're proud of you as well.&quot;
Prospero had the final word. &quot;You're quite a philosopher danny. I understood part of what you said, but bits of it made no sense. Unlike the rest of you, I don't have a christian world view to unlearn. The universe is different from what i thought, but I can see that what i thought does fit in with what I'm learning. It all seems to come back to responsibility coupled with knowledge. We all have to learn to take responsibility for our lives, we have to learn more about this mysterious world of ours. We're all on that path, the path with a heart as you call it.&quot;

            <Text>Chapter 3

After lunch, Prospero took us through a succession of city and town streets. Sometimes the buildings were modern skyscrapers, sometimes modern looking but smaller, ten or fifteen apartment blocks with parkland and once river views, sometimes they were smaller four to six storey whitewashed brick or stone buildings, but by gradual shifts they became smaller, more historical.
Paula took over, and lead us through suburbs that varied from modern to turn of the century. A bank of clouds began to build up on the horizon, growing bigger with each shift. Soon we were walking along a gravel road past small red brick houses, the sky leaden and brooding. There was a growing sense of danger.
Paula finally asked &quot;There seems to be a storm ahead, and it's in all the shadows I want to go through. What do you want me to do?&quot;
I was about to make a suggestion, nalini shushed me. &quot;Paula, right now you are the shadow shifter. What do you suggest?&quot;
&quot;Well, normally i'd avoid a storm, but that means going around. This one looks like it covers a lot of shadows, so it'll be a big detour.&quot;
&quot;What do you think prospero?&quot;
&quot;Oh, I don't mind getting wet, that happens often enough back home on horseback, but I think I would prefer to make a detour. The only thing is, the storm seems to be in such a large number of shadows.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;Paula, stay close to the edge of the storm, but don't take us into it.&quot;
I nodded and added &quot;Like you said, it's a big storm. If we don't go around, it gets fairly ferocious.&quot;
&quot;Okay, but what's so bad about storms? We'll just get wet won't we?&quot;
&quot;Paula&quot; i said quietly &quot;Stop and feel the shadows ahead. Can you feel the danger?&quot;
Nalini added &quot;It's so strong it's screaming.&quot;
Both paula and prospero stood still, eyes closed. &quot;How can a storm  be that dangerous?&quot; he asked eventually.
Experience is often worth a thousand explanations. I thought a question to nalini, she agreed. &quot;Okay, take us into the storm, but be ready to jump back.&quot;
The first shift was into driving rain and deafening thunder. The wind was incredibly strong, almost blowing us over. With the second shift the rain and wind were even stronger, we clung to each other to avoid being pushed over, we were drenched to the skin in seconds; in the distance was a huge black swirl, stretching from the ground into the sky, making its way lazily through part of the town, smashing buildings into matchwood. The noise was somewhere between railway shunting yards and a war zone during shelling. We could not make ourselves heard over the the sound.
Paula took us away, and in two more shifts we were back in dry weather. I commented quietly to prospero &quot;There are hundreds of shadows experiencing variations of that tornado. There could be thousands of people dying because of it, and hundreds of times as many being made homeless.&quot;
He replied &quot;I have heard of tornados, but we do not have them back home. I never thought a storm could be that bad.&quot;
Liz complained sarcastically &quot;A little rain you said! I'm soaked to the skin!&quot;
We were standing on a suburban street, the sun peeping through clouds, glimpses of pale pink sky here and there, and dripping water onto the dry pavement. Nalini said &quot;Gather round, danny and I will try a little sorcery to dry us out.&quot;
We all held hands, nalini and i linked minds and together thought our way through the spell. Spells can be thought of as recipes or rituals, they serve to focus the will on the purpose. With this one, we were inventing it as we went along. I felt the small surge of power swirl through all of us. Within seconds I was dry. I commented to nalini &quot;We should do some more work on spells, I think we're deficient in that area.&quot;
&quot;I agree, but I don't think of spells until I need to do something I can't achieve by normal means. It's a bit hard to come by a book of decent practical spells to get ideas.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;Do you need working spells, or just the ideas?&quot;
&quot;Ideas only. We could talk to durathror about working spells he knows, but from what he has said, he improvises, just like we do.&quot;
&quot;Bur of course he has had twelve hundred years of improvising, and has quite a repertoire built up. We're starting with nothing.&quot;
&quot;Well, there are several fantasy role playing games that have books of spells. I've got no idea whether they'll work, but they should give you some ideas.&quot;
We looked at each other. &quot;It's worth a try. Where do we find books like that?&quot;
&quot;Games shops. I'll show you one my brother goes to when we get back to Brisbane if you like.&quot;
                                ***
We spent some time skirting the storm, which was good practice for both paula and prospero. You can't just navigate toward your destination, but you have to keep it in focus and move around the blocking shadows.
We found ourselves crossing many shadows that resembled european countryside, although the sky colors varied, as did vegetation. There were fields of young corn, fields of young wheat, fields of other grains we could not identify, fields with sheep or cattle grazing, little villages dotted here and there along gravel or dirt tracks. Flowers bloomed in the hedgerows and ditches. We walked variations on a country lane, mostly rutted dirt covered with animal dung.
We crossed a single railway line, separated from the fields by little more than a raised embankment. It seemed to be early morning in late spring. The sky was pink, the sun liquid gold, the breeze cool.
Prospero complained &quot;All the shadows look the same! Except for those ones over there where the storm is raging.&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;There is an infinite number of shadows, so chances are that many of them will be similar. Durathror told me one that if one of korum's kin were living in a shadow, then his presence would create many similar shadows. I never asked korum about it, so i don't know if that is correct. It does seem unusual though.&quot;
We contined down the lane toward a field of young corn, and a village behind. There was a sense of danger forming, both from our current shadow, and from the others. We stopped by the cornfield to rest, and discuss whether we should backtrack. The only thing was that the shadows we'd just been through were also signalling danger.
We didn't have to wait that long to find out what was happening. Across the fields rode two armies, looking as if they intended to converge on the flat area near us. There were similar armies in the shadows around us. We trusted to nalini's intuition, selected one shadow, and stayed there. We settled ourselves under a spreading beach tree to one side of the cornfield, the village perhaps two hundred meters behind us.
Prospero commented &quot;The village will not necessarily be safe, the victors could well rape and pillage, and the fighting could easily spill over.&quot;
&quot;We'll keep a close eye on things, and maybe shift from shadow to shadow as the situation changes. If the fighting comes our way, we're leaving immediately.&quot; I was adamant about this.
Paula opined &quot;I think the storm might be safer.&quot;
&quot;Except that it's fairly close. The other nearby shadows don't seem to be capable of supporting life.&quot; I countered.
Prospero took out his binoculars while I was speaking.
Nalini asked &quot;Do you boys have some hankering to watch the battle instead of brave the storm?&quot;
I shrugged. &quot;I guess I'm curious, but the storm might be safer.&quot;
Prospero said &quot;I have an interest in the tactics the opposing generals use. The ground is quite open out there, but if the situation looks dangerous, i agree we should retreat to the storm.&quot;
Liz said simply &quot;I've never seen a battle. Do they have guns, or is this going to be knights in armor?&quot;
Nalini snorted &quot;Battles aren't pretty, as the rest of us know. Here at least is dry, if we stay out of the battle we could be safer than in the storm.&quot;
The armies were still distant, so we had to rely on prospero's binoculars. There were lines of horsemen in iron hats and breastplates, one side seemed utilitarian and plain, but practical, the otherside more gaudy and less practical. Behind the horsemen came waves of infantry armed with pikes. There was a group that carried weapons that looked like matchlock muskets.
Prospero commented &quot;They seem oddly equipped. They posess armor, but only on the chest and thighs, yet it seems to be well made. There is no evidence of chain mail, they use iron plate. I expect that both of them well send detachments this way in a flanking manouver, the fighting could well erupt behind us if they meet.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;I think they are somewhere from the sixteenth to the seventeenth centuries. The advent of firearms made armor largely obsolete.&quot;
I was thinking that the combatants looked vaguely familiar. &quot;They look a little like cavaliers and roundheads to me.&quot;
Paula shrugged. Liz borrowed the binoculars, then commented &quot;We studied that in school. I was always interested in history.&quot; she was quiet for a minute. &quot;They do look like pictures of them, don't they? One lot look like Cromwell's dragoons.&quot;
Prospero was mystified, nalini only marginally less so. Liz and i explained about the English civil war, where Cromwell deposed King Charles the first. Nalini commented &quot;I know of the civil war in your shadow, but only what danny mentioned some time back. We never had a civil war in my home shadow.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;But that was hundreds of years ago in our shadow, so how could it be happening now?&quot;
&quot;This probably has little to do with the english civil war. But don't forget that shadows run time at different rates. We are quite far from our home shadows right now.&quot; nalini explained.
While we waited, the two commanders formed up their lines, and the battle began. The side we thought of as the roundheads set a line of pikemen, put their musket men into three lines behind the pikemen, and their cavalry off to the far side.
The other side set a double line of pikemen, but bunched their musketmen behind the pikemen at the edge closest to us. They seemed to have more mounted men and fewer men on foot; their cavalry was spread out behind the lines of pikemen.
Prospero commented &quot;Both have spread their pikemen too thin. They should have a double line to hold the cavalry back. But what do you make of their men with rifles?&quot;
&quot;They aren't rifles as far as i can tell, but muskets, smoothe bore barrels that aren't accurate, single shot, and must be loaded from the muzzle with powder and then shot. That takes time, probably as slow as a cross bow...&quot; I replied.
&quot;Then bunching them makes sense. Spreading crossbow men thinly is a mistake, they have little effect because of the time between shots. But why three lines?&quot; prospero interrupted.
&quot;Ah... it's just occurred to me. When you bunch them, they all fire as soon as they reload, in dribs and drabs?&quot; Prospero nodded. &quot;So, form them into three lines, the front rank all fire on command. Immediately the front rank retires to the rear to reload, the second rank advances, and fires on command. Then they retire to the rear, the third rank advances and fires on command. By this time the original first rank should have reloaded, and returns to the front. You can keep this up for as long as you have shot and powder.&quot;
Prospero was thinking out loud. &quot;In my home shadow, the first volley from crossbow men is devestating, but after that they take differing times to reload, and their effectiveness goes down. If they are busy reloading they are easy prey to cavalry. But the process you describe would mean that each volley is as effective as the first one. Any cavalry charge could be cut down. So the line of pikemen can be thinner because fewer cavalry will reach their line.&quot;
We looked again at the battle lines. I commented &quot;Guns make cavalry obsolete. Once you get rifles such as we have back home, you don't even need three lines. The cavalry charge is suicide. I think the roundheads are going to win. Prospero, in your shadow, how does a battle start? when would the cavalry charge?&quot;
&quot;Normally there would be an exchange of arrows, several volleys, which can decimate the front ranks. Then the cavalry charge, and fight it out in the middle. After a time one side gains the upper hand, and chases the defeated from the field. Of course, this is simplifying very much, but in my shadow, the mounted man, wearing armor, is more effective than the foot soldiers.&quot;
&quot;Look!&quot; liz exclaimed, pointing. Puffs of white smoke appeared in the ranks of the cavaliers' musketmen, the sound reaching us as liz exclaimed.
There was a volley from the other side in reply, and we watched as precision changing of ranks occurred. &quot;Just as you predicted&quot; prospero enthused.
More volleys rang out, raggedly on the part of the cavaliers, and in time from the roundheads. They seemed to be very slow about returning fire. Prospero was studying the lines with his binoculars. &quot;Very few casualties. I expect they are too far apart for the guns to be effective.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Their armor might be bullet proof as well. It looks heavy enough.&quot;
Prospero was doubting. &quot;Knowing the power of my gun, I also know that any iron armor would have to be very thick and very heavy to withstand a bullet. I've tested it back home. The armorers could not make armor thick enough to stop my bullets.&quot;
&quot;But yours are high velocity nickel jacketed bullets.&quot; nalini replied, beating me. &quot;That makes them very good at piercing armor. Those guns out there would be firing lead balls. They will still make a mess if they hit you, but a quarter of an inch of iron should stop them.&quot;
Prospero looked horrified &quot;Nalini! A quarter of an inch of plate iron is exceedingly heavy. A man could not walk in such a suit of armor, let alone fight.&quot;
&quot;That's probably why they wear breastplates, thigh pads and helmets only. There's nothing on their arms or backs, and very little on their legs.&quot;
Prospero nodded as he considered this. &quot;Hmmm... that would change things then.&quot;
Nothing much happened for a time, then the cavalier pikemen advanced, under cover of continuous if ragged fire from their musketmen. It seemed the roundheads were content to stay where they were. Every now and then they would return a volley.
Prospero asked &quot;I would have expected the cavalry to charge by now, but I suspect the commanders believe they would be cut to ribbons. How does the cavalry get past the muskets?&quot;
I shook my head. &quot;I've been wondering about that myself. I've a feeling they are kept in reserve until the front ranks have been cut to pieces, then they ride in to mop up.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;I think you're thinking of the nineteenth century, when cannons played more of a role. I think that here the cavalry is expected to charge to open up the opposing lines. That is why the commander is moving his front line closer. He knows if he charges across that distance, his cavalry will be cut to ribbons.&quot; She looked at prospero, then back to me. &quot;I agree with you boys, the cavaliers have lost, their commander already knows it. What he probably doesn't realise is that should the roundhead infantry advance on rapid fire, they would walk all over the cavaliers.&quot;
I was inclined to agree with her. Prospero looked doubtful. &quot;Should they advance, that is the correct time to charge....Um... I suppose if the fire were rapid enough, and the ranks could keep their discipline?&quot;
&quot;Have you timed how long it takes them to reload?&quot; Nalini asked. &quot;The cavaliers are managing about twenty seconds, but many of them take longer. The roundheads i've timed at about fifteen seconds. Given they are in three ranks, that would be fairly steady rapid fire wouldn't you say? If they advance in four ranks it would be even more rapid again.&quot;
&quot;They don't have to charge the other side, just move forward gradually, clearing the field before them.&quot; I commented. &quot;I wonder if their commander is aware of it?&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;I suppose, if you advanced each rank, fired, then advanced another rank, it would be slow, but at that rate of fire they would certainly clear the field. Hmmm.... if the cavalier commander charges, he loses, if he stays where he is, he loses. Now if he could form his musket men into three ranks and advance them, or perhaps dig a defensive bank, then his line could hold.&quot;
He thought about things for a while, and then added &quot;If I were the king's commander, I would bring my cavalry around to this side, so they can charge cromwell's line furthest from his cavalry. He must also move his musket men to the other side to fire on the other cavalry, and this must be done without the other side realizing, or they will reinforce this end.&quot;
We sat and waited. In the shadows around us, battle was already raging, with soldiers charging through the cornfields around us. I kept a watchful eye on the surrounding shadows, keeping one of the less storm wracked ones in mind for a quick escape. We also kept out eyes open for any flanking movement, which prospero claimed would be happening as we sat and watched. However, all we did notice was several peasant farmers in smocks who stood on the other side of the cornfield, pitchforks and axes in hand, and eyed us warily. They were of varying ages, some grey haired, some younger. All had that weather beaten look.
After a time, two of them crouched low, and tried to come up behind us. Realizing they were seen, the elder one spoke &quot;'ere, 'oo be you?&quot; The language was archaic english, heavily accented. He was lined and grey, with teeth missing. The other looked to be his son.
I replied slowly &quot;We are travelers, trying to avoid the fighting out there.&quot;
They appeared to ruminate on this before the elder spoke again. &quot;Be rum biznez, that. Not nat'rel loik.&quot;
The others came over, stood behind the speaker. Some stared open mouthed at nalini and liz. All of them had that family look, I guess you expect that in a village.
Prospero asked &quot;Do you know which side is which?&quot;
The spokesman looked into the distance for a moment, then replied slowly &quot;One be for king, god bless 'im, t'other be for cromwell...&quot; he hawked and spat. &quot;Oi know nowt else 'bout 'em.&quot;
One of the younger ones asked &quot;Think 'ee who'm win?&quot;
Prospero gestured &quot;Would those be cromwell's men?&quot;
There was a general staring into the distance, some half finished sentences like &quot;That be flag&quot; &quot;them 'as crab&quot; before the elder man assented. The younger speaker added &quot;'em both be flyin' England's flag, but yon be flag o' parl-ee-ment&quot; he said is slowly as if he'd only recently learned the word.
Prospero replied &quot;Sadly, the king's soldiers are lacking equipment. If they charge cromwell's men, his guns will cut them to ribbons. They have more horse, if they can entice cromwell to charge, then they could win.&quot;
There were some noises as this sank in, then the younger asked &quot;Be'e lord? 'ee knows summat o' battles, an' speak proper loik. Be no' vrom round 'ere.&quot;
Prospero smiled. &quot;No, we are from the colonies. We are loyal to the king, though there is little help we can offer right now.&quot;
Nalini asked the key question &quot;I am from India, I know little of cromwell. Could you good people explain about him? What does he want, and why has he turned on his king?&quot;
Someone at the back anounced &quot;Oi tole 'ee zo! They's vrom owa indian colony. That be woi she be zo dark!&quot;
Nalini smiled &quot;Correct my good man. Now, would you be so good as to explain about cromwell?&quot;
They did not know much about the politics, but they were full of greivances about cromwell; about merchants fencing in the commons so they could not graze their cattle; about cromwell's soldiers stealing their pigs, cattle and chickens; how the local squire supported cromwell, and was trying to drive them off the farms they had worked for untold generations; that already many of their neighbouring villages had had their tennant farmers thrown into the street, and a few hired hands installed to work the fields, while the disposessed were left to starve, or send their children to work in dark dangerous factories; the prices of everything had gone up while they had little money; the list went on.
Two women came out, chasing children. One ran up to liz, looked at her hand, then touched it with a look of wonder on its face. She smiled at the child, patted its head. &quot;No, the color doesn't come off.&quot;
The child ran back to its mother again, hiding behind her skirts, while the conversation went on. We must have talked for almost half an hour. We answered a few questions in return, but we let prospero make most of the answers as if we were all from his home shadow.
During this conversation the progress of the battle changed. The commander of the king's forces withdrew many of his cavalry and congregated them in an orchard near our cornfield. We missed this, so presumably the opposing side did also. The company of musketeers moved away from us toward the center of the line. At this point the cavalry hiding in the orchard charged, crossing the field near our position, and aiming at the nearer end of cromwell's line, where there were fewer musketeers. The king's musketeers started a covering fire directed toward cromwells heavy cavalry. Cromwell's musketeers put up a disciplined display, shooting volley after volley at the cavalry, with devestating effect.
The shots were coming our way. The peasants fled, we decided to move to a safer position. On the side of the cornfield closer to the village was a ditch about a meter deep by two meters wide, and behind that a dry stone wall perhaps a meter and a bit high. As I scrambled over the wall I remember noting several hens scratching around in the bottom of the ditch, oblivious to us. Several of the villagers were hunkered behind the wall, they grinned at us as we hid with them. The women and children had vanished.
Much of the action was hidden by the backs of the charging horsemen, but prospero still kept up a commentary. &quot;Yes, a masterful stroke that, I do not think cromwell's commander expected that.&quot; As the charge closed with the opposing line, the muskets became more accurate. Men and horses began to drop like flies. &quot;By mitra, cromwell's muskets are devastating! I must remember those tactics for our crossbow men. It will be touch and go whether enough of those brave men survive to breech the line.&quot;
About half the cavalry did reach the line of footsoldiers, and began cutting them to ribbons. Cromwell's cavalry performed a counter charge, but they were facing the massed company of musketeers, and a number were killed. However, it did look as if their armor stopped the bullets from the primitive muskets, because the casualty rate was much lower. The remaining part of the king's cavalry charged into the dragoons from the side, and after that everything degenerated into a free for all. The foot soldiers advanced into the melee using pikes and swords.
Prospero commented &quot;When it gets to this point, there is often little a commander can do to influence the outcome. Extra cavalry in reserve is handy, but at this stage a charge would kill your own men as well. It comes down to the number of your troops, their bravery and their training, plus how a commander has positioned them going into the fight.&quot;
Nalini made a face. &quot;I've seen a few battles, especially the aftermath. I think it's a tragic waste of life.&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;Yes, many brave man are dying right now. Their leaders should not allowed the situation to come to this.&quot;
Nalini snorted &quot;Hah! The soldiers know what they're risking. The horses don't, and that it criminal.&quot;
Prospero looked put out, and kept quiet.
Liz commented &quot;I find it hard to believe this is real. I feel I should be sitting here with a bucket of popcorn.&quot;
Paula nodded. &quot;I know what is going on out there, I've even been in one, but from here it seems like a movie.&quot;
Prospero raised his eyebrows at this, but said nothing. Nalini and i agreed with paula and liz - sitting behind the wall watching the battle was to remove much of its reality. It did seem like a re-enactment or movie.
The battle lasted a couple of hours. The peasants invited us to join them for a meal, we declined politely. We fetched food for ourselves. I wanted to move on, but almost every shadow we could move into featured the battle, and in many the battle had run through the village and beyond. It was still likely to do so here.
Battles are not really pretty sights. Two hours after the melee commenced, it was obvious to us that there were far fewer of the king's men than before. The fighting degenerated into a general rout of the king's troops, with cromwell's men in hot persuit.
Prospero was still watching the progress through his binoculars. He was suddenly incensed. &quot;They are killing their prisoners! The king's men are surrendering, once they are disarmed cromwell's soldiers are killing them! That's disgusting!&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;It may be the norm in this shadow. Persue the losers and kill them. There are several groups headed this way. We should move.&quot;
The peasants volunteered that there was a big royalist stronghold a few miles north in the town of &quot;yark&quot; Prospero turned to us and said &quot;That is to where many of the king's soldiers will be retreating, and probably that is where they came from. Heading south might be safer, with fewer people.&quot;
&quot;It's a detour though.&quot; nalini thought for a minute. &quot;We've wasted enough time here, let's take a detour.&quot;
We took our farewells of the peasants, and headed through the village along the road south. Liz asked &quot;I hope they'll be okay.&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;There is little we can do for them if they won't be all right. If we hadn't been here they would take their chances.&quot;
We passed the last of the houses, and were passing another cornfield. five dragoons on horseback were riding through the field, trampling the young corn, and heading toward the village. Their leader hailed us. &quot;Identify yourselves!&quot;
I called back &quot;Do we look like king's men? We are simple travelers, heading south. Let us pass.&quot; Nalini and i exerted our wills on them.
They glowered at us. &quot;Miserable sinners by the look of ye! Pass on.&quot; They rode on into the village, laughing amongst themselves.
Out beyond the cornfield, the butchery was continuing. Hundreds of horses lay dead or dying, there were probably several thousand humans in similar condition. Shots could still be heard, but most of the noises were screams of the injured. The roundhead soldiers were methodically going over the field, killing their injured opponents, loading their own injured onto carts. The dragoons were spreading out, riding after their fleeing enemies, killing them if they caught them.
We stopped to look. Nalini remarked &quot;Behold the folly of humans. We may use different weapons, but the results are still the same. It's times like this I'm embarrassed to be human.&quot;
Prospero replied &quot;I have always tried to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence. I agree with you nalini, violence is the last resort of the incompetent, but sometimes nothing else works.&quot;
Nalini managed a faint smile. &quot;We know. Danny and I have killed quite a few people because we couldn't find a better way to stop them from trying to kill us. Neither of us will be soldiers, although we have been in war zones before. We leave the soldiers to their games, but we draw the line when they start hurting civilians.&quot;
I added &quot;I took my first gun from a sniper who was in a tall building shooting civilians.&quot;
&quot;What did you do to him?&quot; liz asked.
&quot;I came in behind him and threw him out the window. He'd killed several women and children before I could get to him.&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;There is no excuse for acts of terrorism.&quot; He gestured out onto the battlefield. &quot;You may regard this as pretty barbaric, but the villagers didn't seem to think they were in danger of being raped or massacered. I've read things about your modern wars where the victorious soldiers rape, loot and murder the civilians, while the civilians can do little in return. Here at least, the villagers can kill the soldiers with their pitchforks, axes and pruninghooks.&quot;
Liz borrowed prospero's binoculars, took a good look at the carnage from the safety of the road. &quot;I feel sick looking at that. I don't want to go any closer.&quot;
Prospero took the binoculars back, remarking &quot;Sword wounds may be gastly, but someone has to walk up and do that. A soldier always has a chance with swords. Your modern bombs, land mines and exploding shells are far worse, and you have little chance of avoiding them.&quot;
Nalini and i said together &quot;We don't condone any of that. But human nature is to continue to develop weapons to maim and kill.&quot;
&quot;I think we should get a move on!&quot; paula pointed across the field. Two cavaliers were riding almost directly toward us, persued by a number of mounted dragoons.
However, we'd let go our link with safe shadows, there wasn't really time to re-establish that. We'd have to deal with this crisis as it unfolded. There was barely time to drop our packs.
One of the cavaliers was crouched down in the saddle, his helmet gone, his long blond hair streaming behind him. The other carried the army's flag or standard, it served to make them stand out. They galloped into the cornfield and came to the rock wall at the other end, very near where we were standing.
The horse with the standard balked at the jump, its hapless rider sailed over the fence to land with a thud on the hard ground only meters from us. He didn't move. The other horse cleared the jump, but stumbled as it landed, throwing its rider and turning a quite spectacular cart wheel. It got to its feet, shook itself, and trotted away. Its rider got gingerly to his feet, limping and massaging his left arm.
Nalini knelt to the fallen rider, removed his helmet and began checking his limbs. The fallen man was middle aged, balding, fairly tall. The other rider cursed in some gutteral language. He looked at us, the rapidly approaching riders, and seemed to realise that he wasn't going anywhere. He drew his sword and limped over to us. &quot;Is he alive?&quot; His english had a foreign accent. His face was young, clean shaven.
Nalini got to her feet. &quot;He's breathing, but unconscious. I don't think anything is broken, but we won't know for sure until he wakens.&quot;
The persuing dragoons arrived at this point. The leading riders tried to jump their mounts over the wall; one balked, five jumped, but two of them stumbled. The others reined in on the other side of the wall. Several dismounted and began clambouring over the wall.
The cavalier called out loudly &quot;I am unhorsed. It seems I must surrender.&quot;
The leader of the dragoons was a man with a black moustache, sitting on his horse to the rear of the group. &quot;No prisoners!&quot; he called out. &quot;Kill them all!&quot; He drew a single shot pistol from his belt.
I wondered briefly about going for my own gun, but a gun isn't a lot of use in hand to hand combat unless you can put some distance between you and your attackers. We were effectively surrounded by dragoons, who attacked.
Prospero shouted &quot;Barbarians! You would kill civilians and soldiers who surrender? You give butchers a bad name!&quot; As he said this, he blocked his attacker's sword with his arm, caught his boot with his other hand, and tipped him from his horse. He ducked under the horse, drawing his sword as he emerged.
By now I was too busy to notice too much about prospero. There was a single gunshot, the dull heavy sound of their black powder. My sword was in my hand, I took the hand off the nearest attacker, and the head off a second on my back swing. Their heavy armor made them slow. The cavalier stabbed the man prospero had unhorsed, swung round to face another attacker. Prospero was fighting two and running rings around both of them. Nalini sliced the throat of another dragoon, and suddenly there were very few attackers left standing. More were clambouring over the wall, when gunshots rang out, sharper barks of our thirty eight specials, firing steadily. The dragoons by the walls began to fall.
I sliced the head off my attacker, turned to see nalini wiping her sword on a dead dragoon's cloak, prospero dance his sword past his attacker's guard to stab into the throat. The cavalier was looking around wildly. A little to our left paula and liz were standing, each with a pistol held in a two handed grip, and still firing at the three remaining dragoons, all in the process of turning their horses around in preparation to flee. One by one they fell from their horses. The whole fight had probably lasted no more than fifteen seconds, during which eighteen dragoons had died.
I wiped my sword, checked with nalini that we were both unharmed.
Paula called out &quot;Hey! Annie Oakleigh eat yer heart out!&quot; She removed the magazine from the gun, ejected the unfired cartridge into her hand, then pulled the trigger to release the hammer cock.
&quot;Good shooting both of you!&quot;
She worked the slide again to ensure the gun was empty, released the hammer cock again, and slid a fresh magazine home, and holstered the gun.
The cavalier walked back to join the rest of us.
Liz was still standing, gun in hand, staring with a very strange expression.
&quot;Liz! You okay?&quot;
She looked right through me, then suddenly shook her head. Her hands were shaking, as were her legs.
&quot;Liz, disarm your gun!&quot; I was walking over to her, but paula put her hand on liz, took the gun from her unprotesting fingers.
&quot;Liz, you okay?&quot; I reached her, put my arm on her shoulder. Suddenly she buried her face in my shoulder, sobbing. I stroked her back, letting her cry. Paula walked away to join prospero.
The cavalier was thanking us for rescuing him. &quot;I really tort i vass dead! I cannot belief we kilt all the dragoonss.&quot; His accent sounded germanic.
Liz took out a hankie, blew her nose. I gave her a squeeze, said &quot;We're proud of you. Ya dun well!&quot;
&quot;Sorry, I don't know why I went like that.&quot;
&quot;It's just reaction.&quot;
&quot;But I shouldn't go to pieces. None of you have!&quot;
I kissed her cheek. &quot;Hey, there's a first time for everything. You didn't go to pieces during the fighting. It's okay to cry after.&quot; I led her back to the others.
Both paula and nalini were solitous for her. &quot;How're you feeling now?&quot; Nalini gave her a hug.
&quot;A bit shakey, I'll get over it. How come you guys aren't like that?&quot;
&quot;Ya wanna bet? My knees are knocking! I'm just pretending it doesn't affect me.&quot; paula responded. &quot;We saved the day though. They'd have all been in big trouble if it wasn't for us!&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;Danny and I were physically active, that tends to burn up the chemicals that make you shake. Plus we don't get rattled much these days, our bodies have learned to be serene in the face of danger.&quot;
&quot;Yeah liz, Nalini and I have done years of martial arts training, mind training and so on. It helps, but we still get the shakes sometimes.&quot;
Liz made a wan smile. &quot;Jeez, how many did we kill? Ten or twelve? I never ever thought i'd kill someone!&quot;
The cavalier spoke. &quot;I count eleven shot, eight killed by sword. I find that hard to believe myself. The girl is correct, but for your guns, we might well have all died. I have not seen their like before.&quot; He was watching paula reload her nearly empty magazine. &quot;Can I see one?&quot;
She handed him a cartridge &quot;I'm paula by the way.&quot;
&quot;My appologies, I am forgeting myself.&quot; He drew himself up. &quot;I am Prince Rupert of the Rhine. I was the commander of the king's forces. I take it you are all royalists?&quot;
&quot;I am Duke Prospero of Poitain. The lady paula is my betrothed. She is also the sister to Danny, who is the earl of Bendora. This is his wife nalini, who is a princess from the royal house of Delhi in India. That is her cousine the lady Elizabeth. We are passing through, trying to avoid notice.&quot;
The prince inclined his head with each introduction, saying either &quot;My lord&quot; or &quot;My lady&quot; I wasn't sure whether he believed us, because we had no retinue.
&quot;How fortunate to meet so many nobles travelling incognito, who also happen to be such excellent fighters. Is Poitain in France?&quot;
&quot;No, Aquilonia, much further east, on the other side of India, but further north.&quot;
I added &quot;You too are a long way from home, a Rhineland prince fighting in England.&quot;
&quot;The king is my uncle. It is my duty.&quot; He held up the cartridge paula had given him. &quot;How does this work?&quot;
Paula gave him a quick rundown on how a cartridge was constructed. Prospero added &quot;We use cordite, but black powder will work almost as well. You will need fulminate of mercury i think it is called as primer. These particular cartridges are designed for these guns, they reload automatically from a magazine.&quot; he indicated the one paule was reloading. &quot;The mechanism is complex, and can jam. You need a very good gunsmith, better than you currently have. Try for something simpler, where you work a bolt...&quot; he mimicked using a bolt action weapon &quot;.. by hand to load each round. You can still achieve quite rapid fire, certainly much faster than your muzzle loading muskets, even if you do arrange them in three lines.&quot;
Rupert nodded. &quot;You saw the battle? I had not thought to do that with the muskets.&quot;
&quot;Yes. You had more horse, by rights you should have won. But their use of muskets cut your charge to ribbons. We were discussing that earlier, before you charged, saying that you were between the rock and a hard place. To charge their guns would be suicide, but they could advance in ranks, firing, and clear the field before them if you did not charge.&quot; Prospero replied.
Nalini said to the rest of us &quot;I think we should be getting along. We don't want to become embroiled in this conflict any more than we are.&quot; She bent to check the fallen soldier, who was groaning and jerking. &quot;He's coming round. Prince Rupert, if your man is unfit to ride, I suggest you strip him of his armor and leave him in the village. It is important that you escape.&quot;
He nodded. &quot;There are spare horses here. If we dress as dragoons we should escape capture easily. I thank you for your help. But for you I would be dead. It is a shame we will be unable to make better acquaintances.&quot; He held up the cartridge again. &quot;May I keep this?&quot;
&quot;You may. I wish you luck in your endeavours.&quot;
Prospero turned and asked &quot;Are we just going to leave like that? There is a civil war going on here. We can make a difference surely!&quot;
&quot;Five of us?&quot; Nalini asked. &quot;Prospero, would you have us charge against cromwell's forces, guns blazing? We would die swiftly. We already have made a big difference, for we saved prince rupert's life. He is the army's leader. You don't have your army here. We are on a mission for your king. We should be on our way.&quot;
Prospero made a wry smile. &quot;I suppose you are right my lady. But I believe I could make a difference. I have commanded king Amrik's armies in the field, I ... &quot; he paused &quot;But I would prefer to resolve this conflict without further bloodshed. But to do that I must talk long with prince rupert about why it has come to this in the first place.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;Prince rupert, why were they trying to kill you? I thought they were supposed to take prisoners.&quot;
&quot;So they should my lady, but parliament has deposed the king, and claims their actions legal. When the army was raised against cromwell, parliament decried that as treason, and declared king charles, myself and all his supporters outlaws to be killed on sight.&quot;
Liz started &quot;But that's not how it's supposed to happen...&quot;
&quot;My lady?&quot; prince rupert enquired.
&quot;My cousin is a seer. She forsaw this conflict, but the details are somewhat different from her vision.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I thought parliament just deposed the king, but later during the civil war he gets arrested. He escapes, and raises a second army in France, and this time when he is captured he is sentenced to death for treason. Least that's how I remember it. Prince rupert wasn't killed, but lived out his days with plenty of grand children. But this is different.&quot;
Prince rupert's man sat up at this point. Nalini checked him out, reassured him &quot;I don't think anything is broken. But you might have a head ache for a few days.&quot;
&quot;Arr lady, moi 'ead 'urts zummat shockin'. I think i'm gonna be sick.&quot; He leaned over and vomited. We all moved back.
Nalini looked at rupert. &quot;I don't think he'll be up to travelling for a day or so. In a smock he'd pass for a local with that accent. I suggest you leave him, and you should remove your armor as well, and borrow a tunic from one of these dragoons.&quot;
&quot;That might be wise.&quot; He began doffing his armor.
Nalini summoned a cup, poured water into it, and gave it to the soldier, who rinsed his mouth out, then drank some. Prince rupert and he had a discussion about what should happen next. Finally prince rupert said &quot;Will, I am reluctant to leave you, but if I stay with you, we will both be captured.&quot;
&quot;Ye'll be killed yer mean, yer highness. I'm vrom yark, oi've kin roon' these parts. Save yersel', ye'll do the king no favor boi gettin' killed&quot; Will responded.
&quot;I'll do myself no favor either. Well, let's get rid of this armor, and we'll help you to the villge.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;Where will you go, prince rupert?&quot;
He shook his head. &quot;York is for the king, but that was the flower of our army. The roundheads will take it on the morrow, there is no comfort to be had by travelling there....&quot;
Liz interrupted &quot;This must be marston moor! But york isn't supposed to fall. The king's army was defeated, but that was all. They retreated and continued to fight.&quot;
Will confirmed &quot;Oi, this be marsden. Cromwell has threatened to sack york if we do not hand the king over to him.&quot;
Nalini interrupted &quot;Liz, your vision isn't always correct with regard to details.&quot; She turned to rupert &quot;Is the king in york? They will likely capture him?&quot;
Rupert nodded. &quot;The king is likely fleeing the city right now, for parts further north. But as an outlaw with a price on his head, he dare not go into scotland, for the money loving scots would sell him to cromwell.&quot;
The more we heard, the more it seemed we should do something. Nalini and i were hoping to leave as soon as will and prince rupert headed for the village, but prospero insisted on helping prince rupert support the injured man.
Nalini turned to the rest of us. &quot;Prospero wants to help. I don't know how to make him leave. What do the rest of you want?&quot;
Paula commented &quot;He gets like that sometimes. Can we do something that doesn't put all of us in danger?&quot;
We waited for liz. Finally she said &quot;I thought this was going to be a holiday. If you told me before, I would've stayed at home. Now, I dunno. We are involved, I think we should help prince rupert somehow. I remember from my history that the king and his nobles weren't all that good, but cromwell and his puritans were even worse. The poor thought they'd be better off under cromwell, eventually they had a restoration with king charles the second.&quot;
Nalini looked at me. I smiled at her. &quot;Sweetheart, I know you'd like to help rupert, otherwise you'd never have stayed this long. It's like imladril said back when you were teaching me shadow shifting. 'Sometimes the workings of power will throw a particular shadow across your path, and there will be no way you can avoid it. When that happens, you will need to use your powers to help that place.' Or something like that. If we think in terms of armies, we can't make much difference. We have different powers. I'm not suggesting for a moment that we sneak through shadow and assassinate cromwell, but I think prospero is on the right track. Somehow we have to get all the interested parties together and reach a diplomatic solution.&quot;
Nalini sighed. &quot;Yes love, in my heart I think we should try to help. It may be this is mainly for prospero, after all, he is a diplomat. If it were just you and i, no problem. But i don't want to drag paula and liz into this, when there is a chance they could be killed or injured.&quot; She turned to the others. &quot;This is your chance. If either of you say no, we go, if necessarily leaving prospero here. You saw what happened. Getting further involved could get you killed.&quot;
Liz looked at paula, they both nodded in unison. Liz sighed &quot;We stay. I've always felt my life lacked purpose, that i've never really amounted to much. If we can help here, I'll feel i've done something good.&quot;
Paula added &quot;I've got used to the idea of dying. When it's time to go, I'll go. Until then, I'll use my powers to help others.&quot;
Nalini nodded. &quot;All right, let's go join prospero and rupert. Let's have a discussion about what we can achieve, but not here, it's too dangerous.&quot; She turned to paula. &quot;Could you and liz round up some horses? We'll need six, and don't forget to remove any insignia.&quot;
There were more dragoons in the distance heading toward the village, some from the direction in which the king's army had fled, and others far south down the road we had been walking. There were several rolling hills in between, they were heading down on the furthest visible hill.
We entered the village again, a peasant woman popped her head out and beckoned us to her house. We walked up three steps and ducked under the low doorway into a wide corridor with three rooms leading off it. Shelving ran the length of the corridor, holding ceramic storage containers, baskets of carrots, and other vegetables, eggs and other produce. Dried herbs hung in bunches from hooks, some farm implements were in one corner, and there was a bench that looked like someone did leather work using it. There were several pairs of dirty shoes by the door. Several villagers were crowded in there along with prospero, rupert and will. Will was dressed in a simple smock and legging like the other peasants, sitting on a chair. He had a tankard of ale beside him. He still looked bad, but he seemed in better spirits.
Prospero turned as we came in. &quot;It seems the villagers know will's family, they will take good care of him. I suppose we must go now?&quot;
&quot;There are more dragoons headed toward the village. If they find prince rupert, everyone is in danger. Me must leave now. Prince rupert as well.&quot;
They put their boots back on, said brief farewells, and then we all left the house. According to our shadow shifting senses we weren't in danger just yet, but we could well be spotted very soon. We walked to where paula and liz waited with horses by the south road; the approaching dragoons were now invisible below the line of next hill. Presumably they would be upon us soon.
Nalini remarked to prince rupert as we walked from the village &quot;We have decided it would be remiss of us if having rescued you, you were captured soon after we left. When we get safely away from here we must talk about where you would go, and whether we can assist you.&quot;
&quot;Thank you, my lady.&quot;
She laughed &quot;Please, I am not your lady. Call us all by our first names. Use of titles could get us all killed.&quot;
Nalini and i fetched a coat of ceramic mail and a pack for the prince. I made a pretence of rummaging in nalini's pack then presented them to rupert. &quot;If you wear these, you will look like one of us. You might avoid detection then.&quot;
He picked up the jerkin, asked &quot;Is this some sort of armor? It is very light.&quot;
&quot;Yes, it is a special substance. It is bullet proof.&quot;
&quot;What is it? It is not steel.&quot;
&quot;No, it is a substance called ceramic plastic. Um... you know that diamonds are the hardest gem?&quot;
&quot;Yes, they will scratch any other gem.&quot;
&quot;This is like diamond, but it does not shine.&quot;
He seemed satisfied with that explanation, and dressed rapidly. We were riding south along the road by time the dragoons crested the hill. Nalini asked &quot;Do they know what you look like?&quot;
&quot;Some will have seen my likeness, but most would rely on my armor and standard to recognize me. But as a man with long blond hair and a foreign accent I will still stand out.&quot;
As we walked, nalini and i worked a seeming on him, a simple illusion, changing his hair from shoulder length blond to short and brown. We saw no need to tell him, and it would wear off in twelve hours or so. We did tell him to look confident, as if he had every right to ride with us, and not to make them suspicious by hiding his face.
The dragoons came abreast of us and stopped us. There were about fifteen of them, but one by his black clothes was a puritan. He was portly, middle aged, florid of face, with a sour expression permanently fixed there. &quot;Ask them what they are doing captain.&quot; he said to a dragoon at his side.
This man called out to us &quot;Where are you from, and where are you going?&quot;
I replied &quot;We are travellers, we thought to go to york, but with the fighting we decided it would be safer to go south again.&quot;
&quot;York will be safe again soon.&quot; the dragoon said.
The puritan added &quot;Safe once the devil spawn who hide there have been rooted out and destroyed. You be not english, whence do you come?&quot;
&quot;We are indeed english good sir.&quot; nalini replied, her accent suddenly very english. &quot;We are from our Indian colony...&quot;
&quot;English! You be a black-a-moor! Heathens the lot of you!&quot;
&quot;Sir, we are all good christians of the anglican persuasion. But you insult my lady wife.&quot; I can do a passable immitation of nalini's english accent. &quot;The indian sun is strong, it browns the skin. I request you withdraw your remarks.&quot;
&quot;'Tis not ladylike to wear britches. Ladies must wear skirts.&quot;
Nalini drew herself up. &quot;Think you 'tis ladylike to ride in skirts? When all and sundry can see one's legs?&quot;
&quot;Ladies ride in carriages, not ahorse!&quot;
&quot;Not all places a lady must ride have roads suitable for dainty carriages, my puritan friend. And do not tell me we must ride side saddle, with our legs on public display! Fie sir! Britches are far more practical and far more decorous!&quot;
I was hard put to suppress a smile.
The puritan bristled, but the dragoon whom he addressed as captain, had little time for his antics. &quot;Malory, I grow tired of thy constant carping. Those of us who do not wear the puritan garb are christian too. These say they be anglican, like most of us, though not thyself. You puritans would drive the commonfolk from your cause.&quot;
&quot;Rooting out the devil and his works is our real cause. The king and prince rupert are his tools! These could be too. The world will not be safe until all follow the puritan ways, and all witchcraft has been destroyed!&quot; He waved his finger at the dragoon, then breathed deeply, calmed himself. &quot;I appologise to you folk, I was remiss in common courtesy. Have you seen a tall cavalier, with long blond hair? Fairly young, clean shaven. He rides under the king's standard.&quot;
&quot;We saw someone like that an hour back, with a companion carrying a standard, riding north with perhaps twenty such as yourselves chasing him.&quot;
The dragoon captain looked at the puritan. &quot;Mayhap he has already been captured.&quot;
The puritan looked sour. &quot;And mayhap he has reached york, where his witchcraft will give our forces a hard time.&quot;
The captain made a face. &quot;Malory, had he magics, he would have won yon battle. He did not. Tonight the king will be surrendered, or tommorow York falls.&quot;
&quot;You will sack York?&quot; prospero asked.
The captain shook his head. &quot;No, but today we defeated her royalist defenders. Tomorrow Cromwell's army will ride through the gates in triumph, and take any remaining royalist prisoner.&quot;
The puritan added with what sounded like glee &quot;They will be tried for their treasons and beheaded.&quot;
&quot;But the general population will be safe?&quot; I asked.
The captain nodded. The puritan volunteered &quot;We will search diligently for witches and devil worshippers, and round them all up for execution.&quot;
&quot;Do you expect to find many? How will you search? We have business interests there, will they be safe?&quot;
The puritan replied &quot;Be they protestant they will be safe. But catholics, jews, royalists and other devil worshippers will be rooted out, the branch cut off! We will purge this land with god's holy fire!&quot;
&quot;And we anglicans will be exhorted to join the puritan faith?&quot;
&quot;Of course, we have the one true faith! Anglicans and other protestants may be admitted as christians, and so have before them the hope of being saved it is true, but they need reformation, otherwise they would backslide and lose their salvation.&quot;
&quot;Aren't catholics christians too?&quot;
&quot;Liz, don't antagonize the good man. We have delayed them long enough.&quot;
The puritan was looking quite angry. &quot;Catholics? Catholics! They still claim that the king of Spain is the rightful king of England! They worship idols in direct contravention of our blessed scripture! Their pope is a demon, their so called virgin is a pagan abomination, they would have us believe our blessed saviour must decend from his throne and personally visit every mass that is said across Europe...&quot;
I thought we'd better shut him up before Liz said something to really put the cat amongst the pigeons. &quot;Then we are agreed that catholics are christians, though in need of reformation. I'm afraid we haven't time to debate that now, you good people all look as if you are on a mission.&quot;
The puritan wagged his finger at us. &quot;How can you call them christians? They don't...&quot;
&quot;But sir! All our forefathers, including yours, would have been catholic. It was king henry who started the protestant movement in England, in an effort to reform the excesses of what was then simply 'the church'. You can't go around claiming that catholics are not christians, otherwise neither would protestants be christian, because they base their faith on the same teachings as catholics. But enough of this please. We must find lodgings for the night, we have business in York, we would like to know when it will be safe to travel there.&quot;
The puritan looked thunderous. He breathed heavily a couple of times, before he responded &quot;King Henry was not a true reformer. Yes he started the Anglican faith, but instead of taking the opportunity to purge all elements of catholicism, he retained many of them. It is the puritans, following in the footsteps of John Calvin, who are purging england of all corrupt religions and religious practices.
&quot;Anyone who does not hold to the true christian faith, and all that our blessed saviour taught, cannot be called a christian. I would need at least an entire evening, probably longer, to explain to you all the errors in doctrine, dogma and faith that catholics hold. It starts with the office of the pope...&quot;
The captain cut him off, sounding bored. &quot;Enough Malory, there isn't time for this! We must find whether our men have captured or killed rupert.&quot;
&quot;Before you go sir, when will it be safe to travel to York?&quot; i insisted.
The captain thought for a moment &quot;Bide a day or two. If you ride to the manor, mayhap you can follow cromwell's party when they come to take posession of York. 'Twill be safe then.&quot;
We moved our horses to the side to let them pass. I said &quot;Good Malory, perchance we will meet some day under more pleasant circumstances, and can then discuss this issue in greater detail. I am sure we would find your discourse on what makes a true christian and into what errors the various christian faiths have fallen quite fascinating.&quot;
&lt;&lt;Hey, don't overdo it! He's sure to spot the sarcasm.&gt;&gt;.
That seemed to molify him though. &quot;That heartens me sir. There is hope for you yet. Good day.&quot;
&quot;And may god go with you.&quot; i called after them. We rode on. Everyone was quiet until we cleared the hilltop and were heading down the other side. Then several conversations started at once.
Rupert exclaimed &quot;They did not recognize me! They did not recognize me!&quot;
Liz was angry. &quot;Hey! I'm a catholic. What was all that shit about?&quot; Rupert gave her a sudden wary look.
Nalini replied enigmatically to prince rupert &quot;People see what they expect to see. They do not expect prince rupert to ride openly up to a squad of dragoons and engage them in conversation. Liz and I caught their attention with our dark skin.&quot;
Liz continued &quot;I thought that puritans were supposed to be good people. He was a nasty piece of shit!&quot;
&quot;Liz, I'm sure you recall from your studies that religious tolerance wasn't their strong suit. A lot of it's political as well. Just remember Queen Elizabeth had to be anglican to be ligitimate, and that Philip of Spain had a claim otherwise.&quot; She nodded, remembering her history.
I turned to rupert &quot;Rupert, are all the puritans like that? We thought they were generally good people, not fanatics. He was downright evil.&quot;
Rupert shook his head. &quot;At first like you I heard that puritans were good christians, intent simply on removing the more questionable practices that have crept into the christian faith. I am protestant, though not anglican. There are many catholics in europe, most of them are no worse nor no better than protestants. The popes have caused problems by meddling in politics. There are some problems with the catholic faith, but all the other faiths came from it. I could give you a discourse on what is wrong with catholicism, but I will agree with you that they are christian.
&quot;But did not queen Mary institute persecution of protestants? I seem to recall that she brought in specialists from Spain, on the pretence of rooting out herecy from the catholic faith. Surely you recall that protestant faiths were outlawed, and many who would not bow to Spain were executed, their lands forfeit. That was what led to the thwarted rebellion by Sir Thomas Wyatt who wanted to depose Queen Mary and replace her with Elizabeth. He was executed, and Elizabeth was luck not to be executed also. There are still some in the court of king Charles who claim Queen Mary was poisoned.&quot;
Liz interrupted &quot;I seem to recall she was only in her early forties when she died, so it could be true. Elizabeth succeeded her, and she could be legitimate only if king Henry's divorce was legal, and that was legal only if parliament took the Anglican point of view. She must have taken some action against catholicism too.&quot;
Rupert nodded. &quot;She did indeed, barring catholics from all official positions, and forcing the catholic church to pay tax. She also had many leading catholics executed. But she also barred puritans from public office. She may have had some of their leaders executed. When she died, James 6th of Scotland became James 1st of England, he was more moderate toward the catholics, as is his son Charles. King Charles overturned the bans on puritans, and for a time they seemed content. But then they rebelled, claiming that protestants were almost as corrupt as catholics.
&quot;Sadly, the puritans in England have become filled with hatred of all things non puritan. They see everything as the devil's work, including dancing, having fun or the wearing of colored clothing. At first their diatribes were against the pope and witches, but they became more outspoken, until not only witches were claimed to be devil worshippers, but also catholics, jews, the Irish, the Spanish and the French. To be a christian is no longer good enough, nor even to be a protestant one, now to be saved one must be a puritan. And now their claims have grown even more outrageous, I am become magician and devil worshipper, along with the king!
&quot;Down south, they have a insituted a reign of terror, where people are burned daily as witches because they happen to be catholic, or royalist, or Irish, or have a mole or a mark upon their bodies. Neighbour denounces neighbour and receives their property for reward.
&quot;Our only hope is for the king to be restored, and parliament abolished, but they have superior numbers, superior weapons, they win each battle. They claim it is because heaven fights on their side. York was our last bastion, but our army is scattered, many brave men died today. Scotland will not help, they favor the puritan, and would sell the king back to cromwell.
&quot;With the army destroyed, York will surrender, and hand over the leading royalists. If the king is captured and executed, all our hopes are gone. But I very much fear that with our army destroyed, we have very little hope even now.&quot;
He had become agitated during this recital, and I began to realise just what stress he was under. He was the commander of the king's army, such as it was, and he saw himself as the only chance to stem the tide of terror rolling across England.
Liz spoke first &quot;The king could take refuge in Wales, Ireland or France. He might be able to raise another army in France. There's still hope.&quot;
Rupert looked at her appraisingly. &quot;It's true, he might be able to raise an army there, and perhaps from some of the German states, but the French are not liked in England. France might be the choice for a life in exile though.&quot;
I think the rest of us were wondering at what we could do to help in a situation like this. &quot;Torquemada, the Spanish Inquisition, the French Revolution, Hitler and the Nazis, the Russian Revolution, the Chinese revolution. The terror can only be maintained with the help of spies, inquisitors who denounce people who stray from the one true way, and the army. The general populace support such revolutions because they are fed up with the current government. After a few years they realize they swapped a bad government for one even worse. King Charles must have made many mistakes for the revolution to have happened.&quot;
Rupert sighed. &quot;It is true, he was always more interested in his pleasures than in good government. But he has changed, he will be a better king this time.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;Didn't he abolish parliament and rule as a despot? Wasn't that part of the reason why cromwell originally started the revolution?&quot;
Rupert commented &quot;I was a child then, but I believe he did abolish parliament. When it was reconvened it pressed him to abdicate, but once cromwell gained control, he removed all parliamentarians who were not puritans. Now it is nothing more than a rump, comprising religious fanatics. Cromwell is already styled the Lord Protector, but his protection has turned to terror.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;This may sound harsh, but government by one man depends very much on just how talented that one man is. A democratic parliamentary system is much better, but from what you describe, your parliament is really a junta, which is just as bad.&quot; Seeing the look of puzzlement, she added &quot;A junta is government by a small group of people, typically with the backing of the army. A democratic parliament, where representatives are elected by all the people, works much better. I don't think england has had this yet.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;I'd say not all the army supports them either, judging by what we saw today.&quot;
&quot;If they have started a reign of terror, then the populace won't support them any longer either. An army can only rule in terror for so long before it has to choose whether to massacer the population, or support a revolution to overthrow the government.&quot; I added. &quot;Religious fanatics skew the equation, because they believe the terror earns them salvation or some such garbage. I think rupert is right that parliament has to be abolished to stop the terror. Then a strong government must be installed to oversee the transition, or everything falls apart, and suddenly the French and the Spanish invade. But nalini is also right, the new government must oversee a peaceful transition to a parliamentary democracy. Of course, most people here don't know what that is.&quot;
Rupert asked &quot;Is that something from ancient Greece? Didn't they have somthing where all the adult men of athens met to decide what their city did?&quot;
&quot;Yes, but that is unwieldy when there are more than a few hundred people wanting to have a say. Parliamentary democracy is when people elect representatives of their town or group of villages, um... I think the correct term here is burrough?&quot; the others looked blank. &quot;Anyway, you end up with a few hundred representatives, who meet to form the parliament. after three or four years they retire, and new representatives are elected. They can stand again, but if they did things that were unpopular, they don't get re-elected.&quot;
Nalini was nodding. &quot;You don't really need an army if the people are on your side. These examples won't mean anything to you, but in our experience there was the Berlin wall, the fall of communism, the indonesian coup and so on where people stood up to their rulers and brought down the government.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;There must be a small group of people who control things. They are the ones to target, not the army. Remove them, it will all fall apart.&quot;
&quot;There are the religious fanatics like that Malory we saw. They need to be neutralized as well.&quot;
Rupert had been watching us as we talked. He seemed to be thinking for a while, then asked &quot;Where are you headed?&quot;
&quot;Actually we're just following the road right now.&quot; I replied. &quot;What ever we do is a detour. I'm not sure we can be of much help, but I think we have some ideas to mull over. I know you want to rejoin your army, but you need to be sure that you will not be captured trying. We have to talk about this, see what we think is the best course. Do you know where cromwell is at the moment?&quot;
&quot;Not right now, but he has taken posession of a manor half a days ride from here. He dispossessed a royalist to obtain possession, and had him beheaded for treason. Now parliament is convened there while his forces subdue the north.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;Apart from cromwell, do you know who the leaders are? and where they are? Would they all be at his headquarters?&quot;
&quot;Well, apart from cromwell, there are six others who control the parliament. They would all be at the manor.&quot;
The rest of us were tired and hungry. Although in this shadow it was mid afternoon, our internal clocks were five or six hours ahead. &quot;We need some food, it has been ages since we last ate. Rupert, you must be hungry too.&quot; nalini asked.
He nodded. &quot;I have not eaten since this morning. I am not sure where around here we could eat.&quot;
&lt;&lt;Danny, we need to shift somewhere else. Then once we've eaten and rested we can return rupert. How do you think he'll react?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;He's intelligent, not too superstitious. I was going to say probably no worse than prospero, but here witches are burned. Perhaps we can claim to be elves or something? Can we find our way back to this particular shadow, when there are so many similar ones?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I was thinking of taking him to where he is supposed to rendezous with his army. Like we took prospero and amrik back to tarantia. This place needs help, but they may not see our interference as help.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Yeah, I'm not sure what we should do. We can talk over dinner though.&gt;&gt;.
&quot;All right, we will look for somewhere to eat and rest. We can talk there about what we should do, how we might help. Rupert, do you know where you would rendezvous with your army? Is there somewhere pre-arranged, and do you know it well? Or will you just ride north west in hope of meeting them?&quot;
&quot;Umm... there is a place, I have been there once before. I would need to ask in villages along the way for exact directions though.&quot;
Prospero snorted &quot;And leave a trail for the dragoons to follow?&quot;
Rupert looked downcast. &quot;We did not expect to lose this battle. I did not expect to be separated from the survivors so easily. We always thought the north was for us, but we did not reckon with cromwell's ironsides. Regretably I do not know the north well.&quot;
We came to a point where the raliway crossed the road. In my shadow, railways did not exist during the english civil war, but were invented a century or more later. &quot;How long has the railway been here?&quot;
&quot;Ah, it is relatively new, I know that. I believe they built the line from london to york only five or ten years ago. There is one that brings coal from Wales, another that joins this line in the Midlands. The merchants built them to transport goods to london. But cromwell used them to transport his army swiftly to York.&quot;
Nalini thought to me &lt;&lt;Right here is fairly distinctive. I feel sure I could find my way back here.&gt;&gt;.
I looked around. &lt;&lt;That small crag over there may help as well.&gt;&gt;. Aloud i said &quot;All of you look around, fix this site. This is where we can return to.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Prince rupert, please trust us. We need food and rest, there is none to be had round here. We will take you somewhere else for a time.&quot; We were walking our horses over the rails as she spoke. She reached out and shifted us to a shadow with lemon yellow skies, an ashphalt road and two railway lines. There were now hedges along the side of the road. The horses hoofs rang on the road.
Rupert had time to ask &quot;What has happened? Is this something you are doing?&quot;
&quot;Do not be afraid rupert, you will not be hurt. We are journeying away from your home to another realm.&quot;
Nalini shifted us again. The sky shaded to brownish orange clouds, the road became dull orange gravel, while the trees became spare, dirty looking gnarled pines. It didn't look inspiring.
&quot;Where exactly are we going?&quot;
&quot;We're going somewhere safe, where we all can eat and rest, and discuss what we are going to do to help you and your king, without worrying about shopkeepers informing cromwell's spies.&quot;
We shifted again, and now it was toward evening, the sky yellow green with fluffy pink clouds. In the distance was a small town. The road was gravel, the bushes cleared for some distance on either side. Two more shifts and we were riding into a town along a grey gravel road in twilight. The road was busy, horses and carriages thronging in both directions.
The population seemed mostly to be a cross between asian and indian, but there were as many pale faces as darker ones. Just ahead was a large hotel. We left the horses in the care of a groom, and went in to register. Prospero and paula were trying to explain shadow shifting to rupert. Nalini and i registered four rooms on the second floor, paying with gold coins in advance. Rupert was mystified, looking around goggle eyed at such wonders as electric lighting. The rooms featured such modern wonders as running water for baths and flushing toilets; prospero made sure that rupert knew how to use everything. While that was happening, nalini and i concentrated on fetching some clean clothes for rupert.
&quot;Rupert, our appologies if these clothes don't fit properly, but they are the best we could find at short notice. They may not be exactly what you're used to, but they should be comfortable.&quot;
&quot;By the way, this fastener here is called a zipper. It works like this.&quot; I demonstrated.
He thanked us, but there was a strange expression on his face. We agreed to be ready in half an hour for dinner.
Nalini and i had a quiet chuckle about rupert's expression as we'd led him up the stairs to his room. &quot;I think he's wondering if he's dreaming right now.&quot; I commented.
&quot;He's taken it reasonably well, but it may not have sunk in yet. One thing though, he cannot tell anyone back home about this without being thought either mad or a sorcerer.&quot;
We ran a bath, washed ourselves in a basin while it was running, then soaked for a while. We follow the japanese practice of using the bath to soak, and making sure we are clean first. One thing led to another, and we weren't ready when prospero knocked on our door.
As we headed down, I put my arm on Liz's shoulder. &quot;How're you feeling liz?&quot; Nalini put her arm round liz from the other side, gave her a squeeze.
Liz looked at me, looked at nalini, gave a wan smile. &quot;I'm okay, just a bit sad, that's all. I wish I hadn't had to kill those soldiers. I'll get over it.&quot;
&quot;Death stalks us all, Liz. They were trying to kill us, they ran out of time. It was self defense.&quot;
&quot;Hey, I'm not worrying about it. I'm not sure if I should have come along, 'cos then none of this would have happened...&quot;
&quot;Not to you anyway.&quot; nalini interrupted. &quot;We'd have still been there, but then there'd have only been paula to stop the others from coming over the wall. Things would have been a lot more dangerous for us.&quot;
Liz slipped an arm around each of us. &quot;Thanks guys, I'm feeling better. In fact, I'm starving!&quot;
&quot;It can't have effected you too much then.&quot;
&quot;Nah, takes a lot to put me off me tucker.&quot;
We all went downstairs to a huge restaurant that served cuisine from the four corners of the world, mostly asian style dishes. The menu was written in several languages, the only one we recognized was chinese, but using the complete form characters, not the simplified ones that I am used to. I could read part of the menu only. Nalini can read the complete form, she sent some time explaining the dishes to us, with some help from a waiter for some of the more exotic ones. The waiters spoke a language reminescent of chinese, but neither nalini nor I could understand without the translation spell.
Eventually we ordered up a feast to share between the six of us. Nalini, as she often does, ordered hot chillis on the side. There was more food than we could eat, but prospero and rupert were mainly to blame for that.
Prospero was in gourmet heaven, he insisted we order a few delicacies just because they were there, like a made with snake, and another one made with tiger. Prince rupert was game to try asian style foods, and wanted to be able to taste as many as he could.
Rupert sat back, looked around at all of us, then said firmly &quot;I have been quiet until now, but I think you owe me a full explanation. Where are we? Who are you people? How did we get here?&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;Prospero told you something of the explanation. There are different realms that lie side by side, we can travel between them. We generally refer to them as shadows, sometimes as realms. That you must accept on trust, english has no words to describe this properly. Neither can we explain exactly where we are in relation to your home realm. Think of it this way: a few hundred years ago we all believed that the earth was the center of the universe, and that the sun and stars revolved around it. Now, at least I think this is the case in your shadow, we believe the earth revolves around the sun.&quot;
Rupert looked thoughtful, but nodded. &quot;That theory is banned by the puritans and the catholics alike, but we germans know of it. It is not intuitive, but I understand it.&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;Many theories are not exactly intuitive. They are held because they describe observed behaviour better than intuition. But a theory is no more than that - an attempt to explain how the universe works. It isn't necessarily correct, none of us can claim to know the mind of god when he designed the universe. Even the idea that the earth goes around the sun is very human centric. We assume that we are the most important beings in god's universe, and that there is only one earth. Even the word universe implies there is only one. But&quot; she held up a finger &quot;God has made many suns and many earths, and separated each one by a veil. While this image is not strictly correct, we can visualise these many earths like the pages of a book. It is possible to travel through the veils, god has given some of us the necessary powers. Normally we don't reveal that to anyone who does not already posess such powers. I think you realize that the puritans and others would try to burn us as sorcerers, when all we are doing is using natural powers granted by god.&quot;
&quot;Prospero mentioned something of the elves, implying that they could move between these realms. Admitting that you speak to elves in front of a puritan could be enough to have you burned.&quot;
She nodded. &quot;Then you see why we do not advertise our abilities. Now, it is necessary to travel through each page to get to a particular one. We were passing through your shadow when the battle started, on our way to somewhere else. Now we are trying to help you.
&quot;We are who we said we were; I do come from india, except not the one in your shadow; prospero does come from aquilonia, he is second in command after king amrik. His country is in the process of moving to a parliamentary democracy, I think it would benefit you, your king, along with cromwell and his cronies if they visited there and saw how things are being set up. They are trying to stop the despotism that rule by one man or a small group encourages. Cromwell deposed the king, but now he is dictator in his stead, with his own group of advisors he calls parliament.&quot;
&quot;That is certainly true.&quot; rupert sighed. &quot;I feel I can trust you, that you are not witches despite your strange powers.&quot;
&quot;Prince rupert, we are all christians, although not all identical. Liz is the only catholic here, but despite what you may have heard, she won't grow horns or bite you.&quot; I replied.
Liz added &quot;I'm just the same as everyone else really. We're all human. I mean, where we come from it is illegal to discriminate against people because of religion, or the color of their skins. But I read somewhere that Cromwell excluded catholics from his army, and everyone thought he was being very tolerant. We find that extremely intolerant.&quot;
Rupert looked at liz, who was seated beside him, for a few moments. &quot;It is true, he excludes catholics and jews. I have to admit I was brought up to believe that as a protestant I was morally superior to all catholics, but as I grew up I have changed. Some of my best friends are catholic.&quot;
Liz suddenly laughed. &quot;I'm sorry, that's a bad joke where I come from people who hate those of us with dark skin will say &quot;but some of my best friends are...&quot; Usually I have a problem of people being prejudiced against me because I'm black, or brown really, no one else i've met is prejudiced against my religion. But you are setting me apart because I'm catholic. I should get upset, but I realise you are a product of your age. Listen, catholics aren't bad anymore than protestants are, or puritans for that matter. They are all people, and some people are good, and some are bad. Judge each one by their own actions.&quot;
Rupert replied &quot;To be honest, I have never seen people with colored skin before, although I knew they existed. I believe I never formed an opinion on this. It surprises me to think that people would be prejudiced because of your color. I know we don't like what we call black a moors, but they are heathen, not christian. But you are saying that we should not judge people together because of their religion.&quot; He nodded to himself. &quot;In fact I am sure that scripture says something similar.&quot;
At this point the food started arriving. Nalini announced &quot;All right, while we're eating, no talk of politics or religion, or anything else that is going to get anyone upset. After dinner, we will have a round table discussion about what we can do to help prince rupert. Tomorrow we will start what we decide.&quot;
There was plenty of food, and each dish very tasty. Prince rupert tried eating with chopsticks, but claiming he would starve, he resorted to a fork, like liz. Everybody enjoyed the meal, we all drank wine, and by the end of it i think we all felt quite friendly and mellow.
After dinner we did have quite a free-ranging discussion.
Rupert started &quot;As I see it, my duty is to return to king Charles, and see how things are. If York has fallen, then there will be no safe haven in England, we would be best fleeing to France, living in exile until we can raise another army. If York has not fallen, and our army survives, we may have a chance.&quot;
Prospero shook his head. &quot;Exile i can agree with, but fighting a superior army will not work. You need more men, you need better equipment, you need better cavalry, better guns, better discipline. Cromwell has a well disciplined army, you only had to look at the way they use their guns; his horse are heavily armored, so many bullets will bounce off. If you flee to France, you could raise an army and train it to be better than Cromwell's. But you will also need money to pay for all that. Are there kings in Europe who would lend your king such a sum?&quot;
Rupert rubbed his jaw thoughtfully. &quot;France would let him live in luxurious exile, they might loan him money, but probably not enough. Spain might be willing to lend Spanish troops, but on unacceptable conditions. They have never given up their claim to the throne since Queen Mary married Philip of Spain. They are dangerous catholics, they would probably try to outlaw protestantism. The english have little love for the French, they have even less for the Spanish. If he were to return at the head of a French or Spanish army, he would look as if he were invading. He would not have popular support.&quot;
Prospero remarked &quot;I still think it is possible to resolve this without further bloodshed&quot;
&quot;How could we do that? The civil war has been running for almost two years now.&quot;
&quot;It would have been better to resolve it before it ever came to war. Once a war has started, people support one side or the other, and a peaceful resolution has to wait until people grow tired of war.&quot;
&quot;So what do you propose?&quot;
&quot;Somehow we must gather together the leaders of each side, encourage them to talk with one another, perhaps by means of go-betweens. It is a process, and it can be almost as long drawn out as a war. Each side states a position, the other side discusses what is wrong with it, and then each side modifies their position in the light of the other side's comments. Eventually they reach a point where there is agreement, and the conflict is resolved.&quot;
&quot;But prospero,&quot; i commented &quot;that only works if both sides are prepared to compromise. And even then, the compromise must be acceptable to the general public, or it's not going to work.&quot;
&quot;Yes... as a general rule you are right. But with skilled negotiators, acceptible compromises can be worked out.&quot;
&quot;So how do we get them to dialog? Do we just march into cromwell's manor, and round up the gang of seven at gunpoint?&quot; I couldn't see how it would work.
&quot;No, first we must find out what makes cromwell tick, what his real goals are, and then we can offer some of those as prizes for negotiation....&quot;
&quot;Uh huh... we sell him on the idea of talking to charles. But what? I'm sure charles would negotiate if he was offered the throne back, but that might be completely unacceptible to Cromwell.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;And anything Cromwell wants might be completely unacceptible to charles.&quot;
Rupert added &quot;If this war were at a stalemate then such a tactic would probably work. I am familiar with the general ideas of negotiation and compromise. But Cromwell has all but driven the royalists into the sea. We are trapped between the puritans of England and those of scotland. The only countries likely to offer assistance will be catholic ones, because they want to restore catholicism as the official religion of england. The protestant countries of europe cannot afford to anger their much larger catholic neighbours, nor anger England.&quot;
Prospero made a rueful smile &quot;Gunpoint may be the only way to get them into the same room. But I think I understand this situation a lot better than you others. I come from a similar environment where the king is supreme ruler, by divine right. I am sure Cromwell still has the awe of the king and a love of the king's office buried somewhere inside. He feels guilty at deposing the king, which is why he wants to have him executed. While the king is alive, he is a threat to cromwell, and a source of guilt. With the king dead, executed for treason, he can be given a funeral and is no longer a threat, while the use of the law, and the spreading of the responsibility to the judges will partly ameliorate Cromwell's guilt. I believe that Cromwell and his advisors will negotiate because of that guilt. Offer them an honorable way that doesn't involve killing the king, and they will take it.&quot;
&quot;Sounds good&quot; Liz commented &quot;but what about the reign of terror? What about the religious bigotry? Bigots won't negotiate, because they see that as compromising their religious beliefs.&quot;
Rupert responded &quot;Cromwell is largely a man of honor, even though I do not agree with what he has done. I agree with prospero's assessment of him. However, some of his advisors and some of his supporters are religious fanatics, they will brook no compromise, and will cause trouble.&quot;
&quot;Part of the negotiated solution would have to be dealing with those, and removing them from power. If Cromwell is more reasonable, he might have to be left with some power, and so keep his followers happy.&quot; I put in.
Rupert considered this. &quot;It is likely he would agree to a restoration with sever limits placed upon the king's powers. He must keep his government legitimate, or be tried for treason as soon as king Charles is restored. The king will never accept the limits Cromwell would impose.&quot;
Prospero responded &quot;It must be made workable, else you all condemn the country to an ongoing civil war coupled with a reign of terror. The principles are more important than the people. You could stage a restoration using Charles' son if that is more acceptable.&quot;
Rupert looked at propsero appraisingly. &quot;And if not Charles' son, why not myself? After all, I am his nephew, I too have a claim to the throne. But I see your drift. You would have a restoration, with limits placed upon the king's powers, and a modified form of parliament. Cromwell would not settle for less.&quot;
We tossed around other ideas for helping, but there did not seem to be a lot we could do to help, other than return rupert to his army, or king Charles. We did not have an army, nor were any of us prepared to convince amrik to lend Aquilonia's army to prospero.
Prospero suggested capturing cromwell and having a long talk, but he agreed that without both parties being willing to negotiate, no settlement could be reached.
In the end, we all seemed to agree that it was a black day for the english people in rupert's shadow, but it was a problem of their own making, and they had to develop methods to deal with it. Rupert seemed resigned to returning to the king, and helping him to France, there to live in exile until such time as he could raise a new army.
&quot;But rupert, if we can convey you to the king, you must introduce us to him, or at least myself. I am willing to be the go-between, and see what I can do to get this process going. I admit it will not be easy, but I can try, and I am skilled in such negotiations.&quot;
&quot;Prospero, I thank you for offering. I will try, that is all I can promise. If you are to be the go-between, we must ensure that you do not lead cromwell's men to the king.&quot;
&quot;I would travel through neighbouring realms, no one can follow me that way.&quot;
&quot;Prospero, there would have to be time out while we went about king amrik's business. That can wait a little, but not too long.&quot;
&quot;Oh, they would not expect instant communications. Once the process is started, it may take weeks of to-ing and fro-ing just to set up the framework. It may well be that during this time king Charles retires to France. In my home it has taken months to work out the big picture as you call it for the powers and scope of parliament and the king. It will take months more to set everything up, maybe longer. The same applies to this situation. What is important is a peaceful restoration, and a removal of Cromwell's reign of terror. That could take months or longer.&quot;
Rupert snorted &quot;And it could take years! A good decisive battle would be better.&quot;
&quot;But for how long have you been fighting now? You are not winning either. What if this process had been started back when cromwell sought to depose the king?&quot;
Rupert looked somewhat tired. &quot;There is nothing else you can suggest? Can you not perform some magic, and fix everything?&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;Prince Rupert, we are not magicians, we do not traffic with demons or any other powers. What we accomplish is through the application of natural powers. Even if we could perform some magic, it would not solve the underlying problems. When problems arise, people try to solve them. When rulers or others interfere and prevent that from happening, they fester, and break out again even worse. This civil war tells me that the problems have been around for some time, and rulers have been suppressing any resolution of them.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;Think of it this way, prince Rupert: God keeps arranging for people with ideas to step forward and try to fix the problems that arise. In the past, those people were suppressed by the ruler of the day. The problems become worse year by year, like an unchecked disease, and the remedy becomes more severe each time. It is a shame the situation has come to civil war, but if we were somehow to remove cromwell and his cronies, a new cromwell would arise, and his remedies would be even more harsh than this one.&quot;
He suddenly chuckled. &quot;Suppose you had taken a wound in battle. If treated, it will heal. If you do not treat it, you will swiftly develop gangrene and die horribly. Once it is festering, mormal treatments will not work. But you can still treat it by allowing maggots to eat the rotting flesh. It is not a pleasant remedy, but it can save you.&quot;
&quot;Ugh!&quot; from liz.
&quot;Oh yuck!&quot; from paula.
Rupert raised his eyebrows. &quot;I know there are some soldiers who swear that will work. I do not know of any physician who would prescribe that though. But I take your point, if you are sickening to die slowly from your wound, it is likely you would try such a treatment. So if we liken England to a wounded soldier, he is now sickening of his wound, and the physician is applying red hot iron to burn out the poison.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;But a hot iron should only be used for badly bleeding wounds. The heat itself causes further injury. Distilled alcohol is much better. I am told it causes far less damage, and can reach parts of a wound a hot iron cannot reach easily.&quot;
&quot;But not easy to come by. At least not for the common soldier.&quot;
&quot;Wine will work as well, I am told.&quot;
Nalini butted in &quot;If you boys are going to swap battle medicine, then let me add my two pence worth. Distilled alcohol works on a fresh wound, maggots work where the wound is festering. If the wound does not bleed freely, it should be washed with boiled water, or wine, to get the dirt out. Now let me tell you two other remedies that work. First, take bread that has gone mouldy, and apply the mould directly to the wound. Re-apply fresh mould night and morning for a week, maybe two depending on how deep the wound is, and the wound will heal. You can leave it on the bread, and place the bread onto the wound, or sprinkle the mould into the wound. The other is spiderwebs, you apply them night and morning to a wound. But you must be sure to collect enough spiderwebs to cover the wound. Mouldy bread is easier to arrange.&quot;
Rupert mused &quot;Most soldiers who die from a battle do so afterwards, as a result of their wounds. I will remember the mouldy bread remedy. If I ever get a chance, I will try it.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;The bread rememdy is one I will remember too. I think we've gone a little off the track though. I think I was talking about remedies for despots.&quot;
He looked directly at rupert. &quot;I grew up under an evil king, a despot and tyrant; no one was safe from his depraved lusts, his inquisitors were everywhere in search of those who did not worship the ground he walked upon. He killed all his close relatives lest they become a threat to the throne, including his own children. We had our civil war, the tyrant was deposed and executed. The nobles would then have fought a protracted civil war to promote their own candidate to the throne. Instead we arranged to put a commoner on the throne, but one who has more nobility in his little finger than all the nobles I have met put together. Now we are setting curbs and checks on the king's powers, as well as those of the nobles, and creating a parliament of the nobles and another of the commoners. Kings are not divine, aristocratic birth is no guarantee of noble temprament. It is our duty to create a framework for good government, such that it can be handed down to our children and grandchildren.&quot;
That lead to a story about how Amrik came to be king. Prospero downplayed his roll in the business. When he had finished, Liz asked &quot;Prospero, weren't you the rightful heir? Why didn't you take the job?&quot;
Prospero made a face. &quot;It is true that I probably have the best claim, but once you go past immediate cousins, there are many nobles who have a connection through a grandparent or great grandparent, and most of them will support their own claim. There were eight other factions supporting their own claimant. Amrik was the army commander, he was popular with the army and the general people. Some of the nobles liked him, many feared him, but most of them were willing to back a him in preference to one of their own from another faction.
&quot;So far, Amrik is the most popular king we have ever had, he has the will for reform to prevent abuse of power in future, he has guts to take on the nobles, and he can be ruthless if it is necessary.&quot; He looked around at each of us, his smile flashing. &quot;He is a much better king than I could make, I am happier being a voice of reasonableness. If I were king in his stead, I could not travel as I do. I also have the ears of the nobles, they are more willing to talk with me about their objections than to the king. They still remember how the tyrant would have them flayed alive for the slightest criticism.&quot;
He turned suddenly somber. &quot;I have heard enough about the despotism of king Charles, and Cromwell's reign of terror, it all reminds me too much of the tyrant. I can't just walk away, I have to try!&quot;
                                   ***
That night we ended up going to bed quite late. Nalini and I snuggled up, and later went dreaming together. Nalini has always been slightly better at this than I am. She says I should write that women are better at dreaming than men. They do seem to find it easier, I have to admit.
I was asleep, when I became aware of someone calling my name. I sat up in bed, then realized that the bedcovers were still in place, that nalini was asleep beside me. That meant I was dreaming. The walls were pale pilk, and seemed to bubble a bit like a glass of lemonade. Everything vibrated and danced, proving to me that this was the physical world, not some dreaming double.
Nalini hovered over the bed, wearing a black one piece dress wih emerald green panels. Her hand was outstretched to me. &quot;Come sweetheart, we have some things to do tonight.&quot; She looked as she might in waking, except that there was an aura streaming out around her.
I floated off the bed, took her hand. She felt much the same as in waking. &quot;Yes, where should we start?&quot;
&quot;The village is a good starting point.&quot;
It is simply necessary to visualize where we wish to go, will it, and we are there. Traveling in dreaming is part of the skill of shadow shifting.
We drifted hand in hand above the cornfield from which we had watched the battle earlier today. It was late evening here, but to our eyes everything was luminous. There was a silvery light as if from a full moon, only brighter. Dead soldiers and horses lay everywhere, many horribly injured; hands cut off, faces shorn partly off, some disemboweled. Live humans scurried around, some wheeling carts and checking for wounded, but others were scavangers, checking the dead and dying for anything of value, stealing what they liked.
Over the scene floated spectral soldiers, still dressed as when they died. Some were trying to talk to live colleagues, others berating the scavangers, both with no success; still others wandering around in groups, looking lost.
There were others there as well, others who were not newly dead. Most looked human, some did not. As far as we could tell, nalini and i were the only dreamers, we were the only two who seemed to have a chord coming out of the backs of their heads. The others were either spirit beings, or those who had died at some earlier date. Many were trying to attract the attention of the newly deceased soldiers, with limited success. Not until the newly dead soldiers were over their shock would they be in a position to acknowledge these helpers.
As far as we are aware, the helpers are volunteers who attend death scenes to aid those who have newly passed over. When the death is known in advance, like disease or old age, they are often deceased relatives. But in cases such as this it is simply who ever wants to help. Some were non human, and we have no idea whether they were there to help as well, or were working to other agendas.
Nalini and I sometimes work as helpers for a few hours, but that tends to be very much on an ad hoc basis. There are plenty of deceased spirits around to do that.
We stayed away from the battleground itself with the many newly deceased wandering in shock. Nearby one man was crying out to himself &quot;My wife! My children! Who will look after them now?&quot; I had no words of comfort. If they had no relatives to care for them, they would probably starve, or the wife might have to turn to prostitution to support them. The puritans of course would comdemn her to death if she did and they caught her.
Our plans were to find Cromwell's headquarters, check out the situation around York, and perhaps locate king Charles. We were about to zoom into the sky when we spied a young dragoon sitting on the ground, looking dejected. &quot;Can you help us?&quot; he called out.
He was obviously dead, but only recently, for there was still a trace of the chord that had tethered him to his body. From the look of the body, he'd died from a nasty abdominal wound, probably in great pain, after several hours.
&quot;That depends on what you mean by help.&quot; nalini replied. We floated over to him.
He indicated a young cavalier lying close by, a broken sword blade thrust into his side. There was a pool of blood around, and blood frothing from his lips. The sluggishness of the flow and the dullness of his aura suggested he was very close to death.
&quot;I'm sorry, but he is almost dead.&quot;
He nodded. &quot;You cannot ease his pain? I tried, but I cannot pick up a knife.&quot;
&quot;We doubt it. We have no physical bodies. We cannot pick up a knife either.&quot;
A look of anguish crossed his face. &quot;Then I am dead?&quot;
&quot;Yes, you are dead. The world of the living is no longer your concern.&quot;
&quot;What do I do now?&quot; it was almost a wail.
&quot;Death stalks us all. You just ran out of time. Don't be upset.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;We'll show you where to go shortly, but we should wait for your friend to die first.&quot;
&quot;He isn't my friend, he killed me did you know? And I stabbed him as well, and we both fell down....&quot; He spoke in jerks, as if he were thinking aloud. &quot;It took me hours to die... I was in terrible pain... We talked... I no longer hate him... There were so many things I wanted to do in my life...&quot; He began to talk about his hopes.
We encouraged him to talk, but to be honest it was rather sad listening to him. Liz suddenly popped into existance. &quot;Hi guys, I've been trying to find you. What are you doing?&quot;
We explained. The young dragoon sat there listening. He nodded to liz. Liz looked around, taking in the newly dead, the helpers, the hangers on. &quot;Kewl! I've always wondered what happened when you died.&quot;
The young dragoon asked &quot;Then you aren't dead? How is it?&quot;
&quot;Nah, we're asleep, that's why we can see you and talk to you.&quot;
Just then the young cavalier gave a groan, and expired. He sat up as a fluffy ill-defined cloudy image of himself. &quot;The pain is gone. I feel peaceful at last. Is this death?&quot;
&quot;You are both dead. The world of the living is no longer your concern.&quot;
He looked downcast. &quot;I didn't want to die. I heard you talking to Tom, after he died, and I knew then that there was no hope. Then this feeling of peace came over me, and here I am. Where are we? What happens now?&quot;
&quot;This is when you find out that all your religious beliefs were not quite correct. It can be quite a shock.&quot; We helped both of them to their feet, introduced ourselves. The cavalier's name was James.
&quot;Look around you, you will see all the other dead souls, plus volunteers to help them adjust.&quot; nalini instructed. &quot;War is such a waste.&quot;
Tom, the dragoon, commented &quot;It was supposed to be glorious, fighting for god and country against the forces of evil.&quot;
James countered &quot;But we fought for god, king and country. Your side was the evil one.&quot;
Nalini swept her arm around, indicating the strewn battlefield. &quot;There is your glory: dead bodies, blood and shit.&quot; There was anger on her face. &quot;As for the forces of evil, both your leaders claimed to act for god and country. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. This is where fanaticism, intolerance and bigotry lead. You have cut short each other's life. War is never glorious! Violance is the last resort of the incompetent. Both your leaders were incompetent. They bear the bulk of the blame, but each of you bears responsibility for your own actions. Remember that.&quot; She sighed.
&quot;So what happens now? Do we get judged? Will we meet the saviour, or weren't we good enough?&quot; Tom asked. Both of them were hanging their heads, as if ashamed of their lives, or their situation.
&quot;While you were alive, you were spiritual babes, you were given milk, not meat. Even your priests were spiritual babes.&quot; I replied. &quot;While you are here, you will meet others who live in their own little fantasy worlds. They expect certain things to happen after death, like cherubs with harps, or demons with pitchforks, and they will create them with their imagination. You will also meet others who will explain in much more detail what we are telling you now.&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;We won't overburden you now, there is plenty of time to learn and understand. Firstly, hell, by and large, is out there, where you were alive, where humans perform all sorts of degrading acts upon each other. There are spiritual hells, but humans very rarely go there, and i don't think either of you could conceive of the sorts of evil you would need to merit a journey there. Neither of you are damned.&quot;
I think both of them looked relieved. I continued &quot;Where we are now is the lowest level of the spiritworld. Here you can see the physical world, but you cannot touch it. Some gifted people can see you, most people cannot. And in your land, the puritans and the catholics burn those who can see you. Those who burn others are evil.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Each of you will be given another chance. You will stay in the spirit world for a time, and then you will be reborn as another baby, with little memory of your previous life. God is not the stern perpetrator of hate as portrayed in your religions, god is a loving parent. If you tried, but failed, you will be given another chance.&quot;
They both nodded. James asked &quot;How are we reborn? The scripture does not teach that.&quot;
&quot;Spiritual milk for spiritual babes.&quot; I replied. &quot;You may remember from your scripture, the people asked Jesus about a man born blind, was it because of his parents' sins, which was the jewish interpretation, you sin and your children and grandchildren suffer, or was he born blind because of his own sins? He could only be born blind because of his own sins if he had lived before, otherwise you would have god punishing you for sins you have not yet committed. If you had read your scripture, you would find several instances like this, and nowhere in the scripture did jesus ever deny that people could be born again. But you don't tell babies that they will be given another chance, because they will do nothing and put everything off until next time.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;Have either of you been to school?&quot; Tom had been for two years, while James had been for three. She added &quot;Life is like time spent at school. There are a number of lessons you have to learn. If you do not learn them, you have to repeat them. Death is like the end of the school year, you take a break, then return to new lessons. This is your break. This is your chance to review what you learned, or failed to learn, in your last life.&quot;
They both looked at one another. &quot;This is nothing like the pastor told us.&quot;
&quot;No, he knew very little about this.&quot; I replied. &quot;Here in the spirit world you will be unable to meet people that are not compatible with you, except at this lowest level. You will gain very little by hanging around here, pining for the life you left. You can come back here to see how loved ones are doing, but you must remember that they cannot see you or hear you. You will probably only upset yourselves. You must let the living get on with their lives. You have other things to do.&quot;
They both looked sad. Nalini continued &quot;You probably have lots of questions, though it may take you a while to realise. Not everyone you see around you is dead. Some are spirit beings, who have never been in living bodies...&quot; she pointed out some, explained a little about spirit beings. &quot;We three are dreamers, you can tell that by the chord that tethers our spirit bodies to our physical bodies...&quot; She launched into an explanation of dreaming, and how dreamers could visit the spirit world. We were both tailoring our explanations for the level of understanding of these two, trying to couch them in terms they were familiar with.
We lead them slowly away from the battlefield, out over the moor. &quot;Now, it's time to lighten up, stop feeling sorry for yourselves. If you know your scripture, you will know that Jesus said 'In my father's house there are many mansions'. It's an odd expression, because a mansion is a house. Perhaps he should have said 'In the spirit world there are many places', but that doesn't have the same ring.&quot; I paused. &quot;There are many regions in the spirit world, we are about to take you to one, introduce you to others who can help you further. But first, we need to tell you that if you wish to move around in the spirit world, as opposed to just floating here, you need to visualize where you want to move to, and will yourself there. This we will try to teach you now. Firstly, please look around here, fix this location in your memories.&quot; We gave them time, waited until they indicated they were ready. &quot;Okay, please give us a hand each.&quot;
We took their hands, and led them to the area near the university, close to the street with the outdoor cafes. Nalini spoke &quot;This town is probably where you will be staying for a time. Now, could you please look around here, and fix this locale in your memories. Then we will get you to try to go back to the first one.&quot;
&quot;Where are we?&quot;
Nalini took time to explain about the lowest levels of the spirit world corresponded with the physical, that there were other levels where spirits of the dead lived. &quot;This is just one region in one level. There are many other regions, you might get to visit some others during your stay here. We will show you around here shortly.&quot;
She turned to Tom, who was standing beside her. &quot;Tom, I want you to take me back to the battlefield. Visualize it, and decide that you want to go there.&quot; She took his hand.
I turned to James. &quot;I'm sorry I'm not as good looking as she, but you can hold liz's hand as well, and take us back there. Visualize it in front of you, imagine youself moving toward it.&quot; Liz smiled at him, took his other hand. A few seconds passed while he gathered himself, then there was a momentary streaming sensation as if we were moving very fast, and the three of us were back where we started. Nalini and Tom were nearby.
&quot;Good! Not everyone can do that first time. When you are in a region, you can float around, or walk or what ever. But if you want to travel from one region to another, you have to visualize it first.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;That makes it difficult to go somewhere you have never been before. There are ways of finding out nearby regions, but we don't have time for that now. The other way is to befriend someone who has been to another region, and have them take you there. Could you boys please take us back?&quot;
That took a little longer, but they managed it. Nalini indicated the outdoor cafes. &quot;This is a place where those who inhabit the spirit world can meet up with dreamers like ourselves. We come here regularly, if you see us, don't be shy about coming over and talking to us. If you look around, you will see others with the chord coming from their backs. They are all dreamers.&quot;
The two nodded. They were looking happier now, away from the battlefield, as if realizing that being dead wasn't the end of the world, and they might even enjoy themselves here.
&quot;We have time for a quick guided tour, and then we must go.&quot; Nalini commented.
I added &quot;We brought you to this region because this is one we know of, and of the ones we know, we like it the most. If you had met up with different helpers, they might have taken you to other regions.&quot;
&quot;What are some of the other regions like?&quot; James asked.
&quot;For now you will have to trust us on this, we don't have time to show you the others we know of. Look for us around the cafes here, we will be back from time to time. But there are others we will introduce you to who can do the same.&quot; I thought for a moment.
Nalini added &quot;One is a huge grassy meadow that stretches for ever, with a river running through it, flowers blooming. It is where the pre-christian romans and greeks congregate, but there are many others there also. We call it the Elysium fields after the greeks. We find it a bit boring though....&quot;
I added &quot;Another one is where people spend all their time either fighting battles with each other, or eating, drinking and fornicating. It appeals to certain types, but neither of you strike me as that type.&quot;
Tom asked &quot;But I thought we didn't need to eat or drink or fornicate once we are dead?&quot;
&quot;You don't. But many humans try to build a semblance of the life they had. So you can find regions where people congregate in villages, tend their little farms and so on. Many of them don't even realize they don't need to do that.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;If you have relatives or friends who have died, you can find them by visualizing them, and willing to be with them. It won't always work, because some of them may have already been reborn, some you won't know well enough, and some will be in regions that are not suitable for you. While you can go to those regions, it will be hard work, and unpleasant.&quot;
I added &quot;If you think about it, evil people die too. Where do they end up? The short answer is they end up in regions with others like themselves, and some of those regions can be very unpleasant, like being thrown into prison with a bunch of cut-throats.&quot;
Tom remarked &quot;That is the first thing you have said that gladdens my heart: that evil people get to suffer in the hereafter.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;They do, but they cause their own suffering. They prey on each other. It's rather fitting really.&quot;
Tom asked &quot;You said hell doesn't exist. Then you went on to say that there are regions that are something like purgatory. What about heaven?&quot;
&quot;That depends on what you mean by heaven.&quot; I replied. &quot;If you mean somewhere you sit on a cloud playing a harp, then that region exists, and people go there. But if you mean somewhere in the real presence of god, where you can look upon his face, then forget about it. God is not an old man with a long white beard, humans have a very long way to go before they can consider what they even mean by being in god's presence.&quot;
&quot;But what about the saviour? What about the evangelists and the appostles?&quot;
&quot;They are all around somewhere, helping others, teaching them how to be better people.&quot; I replied, wondering again how to explain all this. &quot;Let me put it like this. Jesus came with a message to the Jews, to tell them that being righteous under the law was not the path to salvation, that they had left out compassion and love. Paul and the evangelists extended that to the pagans. The movement became known as christianity. But somewhere back in the second century, christians forgot about the message, put Jesus on a pedestal and began worshipping him. It was the influx of all those pagan romans and greeks that caused that. The protestants talked about the evils of the catholic church, and the need for reform, but they all missed the vital point. The reform that christianity really needs is to take jesus off the pedestal, to stop worshipping him, and to start trying to live like him. Each of us is responsible for our own salvation, by our own acts, our own words, our own thoughts. Jesus told us of a path, but it is up to each one of us to walk that path. Those who preach that salvation needs only accepting jesus as saviour, and having faith, are misguided, because all that does is say we are willing to walk the path. If we don't actually walk that path, we never attain salvation.&quot;
The two looked at one another. Liz commented &quot;Sheesh danny, you sound like a priest or something.&quot;
&quot;I went to a church school, I did a lot of bible studies when I was younger.&quot; I smiled. &quot;I've also done a lot of comparative religious studies, but these two are christians, any explanation has to be in terms they understand. Plus we've had some practice at this sort of thing now, these aren't the first we've helped.&quot;
Tom remarked &quot;I always thought that faith was not enough. But isn't jesus the only son of god? Why shouldn't we worship him?&quot;
Nalini commented gently &quot;Hey boys, we're getting into heavy stuff, and we don't have a lot of time.&quot;
&quot;I'll give a quick answer, you'll have to think about it for a while. Firstly not all the evangelists claimed that jesus was the only son of god. That idea was entrenched by the council of nicea in I think 331 AD. That's where the nicene crede comes from, and the 'only son of the father, begotten, not made' and so on. Before that there was a raging debate about whether he was the only son of god, or just one of many sons, or not even a son of god at all.
&quot;Secondly, there are different versions of how he came to be god's son. Mark, who was a desciple and wrote the first gospel, claims he became god's son when he was baptised by John. His original text has god saying 'This is my beloved son, today I have begotten him'. This was changed sometime between the sixth and ninth centuries to read 'This is my only begotten son'. You won't have access to the original text yet, because it is hidden away in the vatican because a cardinal or a pope realized that it would mean changes to their dogma. Matthew and Luke have Jesus a son of god because the holy ghost impregnates Mary. They differ on the details, Matthew has jesus a descendent of David because of Joseph's lineage, while Luke has him a descendent of David by Mary's lineage. John on the other hand, like luke, rejects all stories of virgin births, and instead has Jesus as a special being because his soul was the logos, the word of god.
&quot;Thirdly, if you read the psalms, they have all of us as sons and daughters of god. Paul in his letters takes the same tack, and even quotes Mark's original text about 'today i have forgotten a son'. The editors of the bible forgot about that when they changed Mark's words.
&quot;Fourthly, worshipping Jesus has caused most christians to forget about what Jesus taught. They feel that if they believe he was the only son of god, and their saviour, and they go to church on unday, and follow the ten commandments, then they are saved. Okay, here endeth the lesson.&quot;
James commented &quot;Phew! I wish pastor michael were here. He would be able to quote bible at you.&quot;
Tom looked somewhat angry. &quot;Sir, if i were still alive, I would disagree with you on almost every point. But I would ask you to prove what you say with a bible. The fact that I am dead, neither of us has a copy of the bible, and things are not as I believed they would be means that I can no longer be sure about what I was taught.&quot;
&quot;You don't have to believe me, just think it over. If you have occasion to come across someone with a bible, or go back to earth and read over someone's shoulder you might find the passages I mean. But I would say don't believe blindly, test everything, be a doubting Thomas like your namesake, and ask for proof. The world is a lot different from what your priests have taught you. Now, let's go on a quick tour of this place.&quot;
We floated into the sky to look down on everything. Both Tom and James exclaimed as we rose. &quot;We can fly here!&quot;
&quot;Except you don't need wings!&quot; nalini replied. &quot;It's the same principle as floating above the ground, only a little higher.&quot;
The town was spread out beneath us. There was a broad river flowing between parkland. On the nearer bank, the parkland had the extensive gardens and the sandstone buildings of the university, open areas with amphitheaters, stages and so on. There seemed to be people everywhere. On the further bank, the parkland was more ornamental, with mazes, gazebos, formal Japanese gardens, formal gardens from other parts of the world, informal gardens of various styles. Around all this was a maze of streets with small buildings, many of them shops, cafes, theaters and so on. We pointed out places of interest.
Nalini commented &quot;There are lectures on almost any subject you can think of being given in the university and outside in the gardens. You will be welcome to attend.&quot;
We zoomed down again, and made our way through the gardens. We passed street theater performances, poetry readings, music recitals, many with the audience participating. There was an artist performing before a group, creating images on a large canvas by thought alone. We weren't wandering at random, we were meandering toward what I always think of as an Ancient Greek version of stone henge. It is a large ring of broken doric columns and a few greek statues.
Nalini turned to the two soldiers &quot;This is a designated meeting area for helpers to bring newly deceased. The people waiting for us are trained in helping those who have recently died. They will be willing and able to answer your questions, and spend more time with you.&quot;
We alighted near a group of three people, one a slightly paunchy bearded man in a toga, the second a tall read haired female dressed in something green and foamy, floating around her, the third a slight man with asiatic features, long thin moustache, who wore a formal chinese gown in pale violet silk worked with red and gold thread.
They stopped their conversation to greet us. &quot;So, you have brought us two newcomers?&quot; the female said. &quot;Welcome.&quot;
Nalini performed the introductions. &quot;This lady is called Bogdana, this gentleman...&quot; she indicated the man in the toga &quot;..is called Gaius Petrus, though he prefers Peter these days, and this gentleman is Lao Wang Bing&quot; she pronounced the names with the correct tones &quot;although he calls himself Laurence.&quot;
&quot;It is easier for westerners to pronounce.&quot; he smiled at the soldiers.
The three greeted the soldiers warmly. We explained the circumstances under which we found them. Bogdana shook her head. &quot;War is a terrible calamity. All three of us were killed in wars of one sort or another. We will help you settle in here, answer your questions, introduce you to others. There were three others who came in a little while ago who may have come from your battle.&quot;
Peter made chairs appear for all of us. &quot;Please sit, let's talk.&quot;
Nalini declined &quot;I'm sorry Peter, but we three have things to be done before the night wanes. I hope none of you will mind if we leave?&quot;
Peter complained &quot;But you have only just arrived! I don't know, you living, always rushing about.&quot;
Tom asked tentatively &quot;You will return? To visit us?&quot;
&quot;We will. But we are constrained by the demands of living. We often meet at the cafes we showed you. But if you want to talk with us, visualize us. If we are dreaming, you should be able to come to us, althoug that will depend on where we are.&quot;
I shook both their hands. &quot;Good luck. I know you have lots of questions. Take care of yourselves.&quot;
Nalini and liz kissed their cheeks. The three volunteers hugged each of us, and then we left. I took liz's hand, put my arm around nalini's waist, and we moved back to the battlefield we'd left some hours before.
&quot;Liz, you wanted to talk with us about something?&quot;
&quot;Uh.. Yeah. But I probably don't need to now. I wanted to talk about those soldiers we shot. It's been preying on my mind. But they're out there somewhere like those two, aren't they?&quot;
&quot;Can't speak for each one individually, but they should have encountered helpers who would have done something similar to what we just did.&quot;
&quot;They might not be in the same region though.&quot; nalini added. &quot;That depends on the which one the helper is from.&quot;
&quot;So I shouldn't really feal guilty about it, should I?&quot;
&quot;No, they were trying to kill us. Death is just part of the cycle. They ran out of time, or their personal power wasn't sufficient, you can look at it either way.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;If there had been fewer of them, we might have been able to try things like knocking them out, but with that many we would have signed our own death warrants.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I understand all that. I just didn't like the idea of actually shooting people. I mean, I just reacted like you showed me when paula told me we had to shoot. It was only afterwards that I thought jeez I've actually shot and killed people. An' I felt sad and guilty about it.&quot;
&quot;You have a very cool head Liz, but the first time you're in danger is always the worst. After that you seem to develop confidence that you have the ability to get out of the situation. I don't think any of us reacted as coolly the first time.&quot;
&quot;Gee thanks.&quot; It was flattery, but she smiled anyway. &quot;I know you've told me before, but I never really connected with the idea that all those people round the university are dead. It's not unpleasant at all. So why are we all so afraid of death?&quot;
Nalini and I looked at each other. &quot;We have a theory, but we don't know for sure....&quot;
&quot;..some regions are unpleasant, but that's because unpleasant people, the ones who enjoy hurting others, tend to congregate together...&quot;
&quot;..if we weren't afraid of death, many people would commit suicide the moment things on earth became unpleasant. It'd be like missing the end of year exams...&quot;
&quot;..you'd have to redo everything, and cope with all the unpleasantness again...&quot;
&quot;..In fact I think it was Wang Bing who told us that suicides tend to end up in the lower regions, the less pleasant, because of their mental state when they commited suicide. But what they ran away from doesn't go away, because it comes back next life, in very similar circumstances....&quot;
&quot;..Not exactly identical, but it's like you have to repeat a year at school, most things will be the same...&quot;
&quot;..It's not god punishing you, it's yourself, your workings of power, organizing your lessons for you...&quot;
&quot;..Just like you had a question about death, and here we were helping a couple of boys who had died. What happened after that answered most of your questions.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, that's really odd isn't it? I was feeling bad when I found you, but after i watched you, I feel better. Now I know they'll be okay.&quot;
Nalini smiled &quot;So we managed to provide the right therapy for you huh?&quot;
&quot;Yep! I'll stop feeling guilty. It's probably just my catholic upbringing. Hey, how do you guys finish each other's sentences like that?&quot;
&quot;Telepathy. We've become used to it. We are going to check out a few things in this shadow, you want to tag along?&quot;
&quot;Sure! I'm always learning things from you guys.&quot;
We floated into the sky to look down on everything. Over there was a walled town that had to be York, with the road running south through the gates, across the moors through a number of small villages, past the battlefield and on south. The town had grown so that much of it now sprawled outside the medieval walls. Running close by was the single railway line, a silver thread that tended to take a straighter line, skirting villages and crossing the road in several places.
Liz asked &quot;I've been wondering, those different regions, they're like different religions ideas of heaven and hell aren't they? You mentioned those Greek fields, and the other one that sounded like Valhalla...&quot;
&quot;I don't think any of us know which came first, the region, or the religion that regards that region as heaven or hell. People visit regions in dreams, they come back and tell people that's what heaven or hell is like, people believe it, and look for it when they die....&quot;
&quot;..Other people teach things, and then when people die they expect to find what they were taught, so they create that environment. Like the angels with harps sitting on fluffy clouds...&quot;
&quot;..Imladril told us a long time ago that those who believe in something are never too shocked by what they find after they die, because they expect to see something. Those who believe that there is nothing to survive death are the worst off, because they shut themselves off from everything, and become lost in a black fog. None of the helpers can reach them until they realize they still exist...&quot;
&quot;..Reminds me of an old joke. Person dies, gets into the afterlife. A helper is showing them around, saying 'this region is for the buddhists, that region is for the anglicans, this one is for the catholics...' and so on. Then the helper says 'you can visit any of these regions, but don't go near that one over there behind the fog bank.' Deceased person asks 'Why?'. The helper says 'Oh, that one's for the born again christians, they think they're the only ones up here.' Of course, you can insert the name of any religion you want to slander.&quot;
Liz smiled &quot;I think I've heard that one before danny. But it's sort of appropriate isn't it?&quot;
In the distance we spotted many campfires of soldiers camped around the grounds of a country estate. &quot;This could be Cromwell's headquarters.&quot;
We floated down, skimmed over the camp. The manor had extensive grounds laid out as formal gardens with large lawns, and small lake, numerous stands of trees, and a large vegetable patch. There were many soldiers bivouacked around the grounds, we didn't stop, but headed toward the manor. The building was a mishmash of styles, one wing of yellow sandstone with small windows and crenelated top like some medieval castle, The middle section of lighter sandstone, with larger windows latticed with small diamond panes, the right wing of whitewashed brick, windows with larger panes of glass. The ground floor windows were all barred with iron trellis work.
We decided to explore each wing of the castle, and held a quick debate about which wing to start with. The old wing was closest to us, so we started there. I took nalini's hand, held out my other for liz, and then we floated up to the wall.
&quot;How do we get in?&quot; liz asked.
&quot;Through the wall! Physical barriers can't stop us.&quot;
&quot;But someone who knows what they are doing can also place astral barriers that coincide with the wall. Astral barriers are a lot harder for astral bodies to penetrate.&quot;
&quot;That's why the things in the university region are solid to us.&quot;
&quot;Let's go.&quot;
Up close, the sandstone shimmered and danced like a mirage. I stretched out the hand that liz held, pressed it against the visible surface. There was a watery sensation as if the wall were a water curtain. Our hands passed into the barrier.
&quot;Kewl! It feels more like water.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;The trick is to will yourself forward. Otherwise your perception will tell you it's a wall, and your body won't move.&quot;
We drifted into the wall. Perceptually it was like moving through thick fog, or murkey water. For a moment there was nothing to see except the dancing yellow texture of the wall, along with a cold clammy feeling. Thenwe were through. Inside were faded tapestry hangings, unpolished wooden floors, a central coridor with dark wooden walls, and rooms with heavy doors opening off it. Most of the rooms seemed to be guest rooms with what we presumed were officers sleeping. Other rooms held ancient suits of armor, there was even a stockpile of crossbows. The downstairs quarters seemed to be mainly for servants, the rooms were smaller, dirtier, and in some we spied servants' livery.
The central wing contained larger rooms, a large room that looked like a banquet hall, and more corridors. The wooden floors were polished, and the walls were panelled in dark wood. The overall effect was dark and gloomy. There seemed to be a mixture of military and administrative types sleeping in the many rooms. The military types possessed body armor and tin hats, the others did not have such on display. The puritans could be determined because of their tall black hats.
The right wing was obviously the newest. There was dark wood wainscotting, covering only the lower section of the walls, the upper section being plastered and painted in bright colors. Most room had a pale ceiling and walls of a single color, such as yellow, light blue or green, or red. Many of the rooms were hung with paintings. Most of the peope sleeping here looked like administrative types. The bedrooms in this wing were more like separate apartments, with sitting rooms
Nalini commented as we passed through &quot;This is the newest wing, these must be the most important people. I wonder which one is cromwell?&quot;
Liz commented &quot;I think I will recognize him, I did see a painting of him. He had one of those faces you could remember easily.&quot;
We found several people whom we considered to be parliamentarians mainly because they were all at the end of the wing furthest from where it joined the central wing, in the largest bedrooms. Cromwell was surprisingly easy to recognize, a middle aged man, hair greying, a number of moles and warts on his face putting him with the ugly members of humanity.
&quot;Now liz, if you look closely, you will see a thin blue gray chord coming from his body, and disappearing.&quot;
&quot;Oh yeah! Is that the thing that connects with our dreaming body?&quot;
&quot;Yes! Now, we want to have a talk with Cromwell. We were hoping to talk with his cronies as well, but we may not have time now. So it goes hey?&quot;
&quot;How do we get to him? I mean, he's off somewhere dreaming.&quot;
&quot;He is, but he is tethered by the chord.&quot; Nalini replied. &quot;You are correct that we don't know him well enough to simply visualize him and find him. Put your hands on me so I won't lose you.&quot; She let go my hand, then liz and i moved behind her, put our hands on her shoulders. She extender her hands and cupped them around the chord, not touching. &quot;Now Liz, if you touch the chord of another dreamer, you almost always cause them to wake. What I am doing is getting close enough to feel its emanations without actually touching. Now I need to use my senses to feel ahead along the chord to where Cromwell's dreaming body is.&quot; We waited quietly for a few moments. I was linked with nalini and could feel what she was doing. Her hands seemed to elongate along the chord, and vanished off into the distance. &quot;All right, I can feel him at the other end. let's go.&quot;
There was a momentary blur of speed, and we were in another abode of the dead. Choirs of angels sang in sweet voices, accompanied by majestic music. Brightly colored stained glass windows floated freely, while crowds of people dressed in flowing white robes mingled around. Cromwell was on his knees, his face filled with rapture, tears running from his eyes. He was wearing his black puritan garb. We backed away, not wanting to disturb him just yet. Nalini and I changed our rainment to white robes.
Nalini commented to Liz &quot;You should change your own clothing to white robes.&quot;
&quot;How?&quot;
&quot;Just think about your clothes. This is dreaming, you know you can change things around. We don't want to stand out too much.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot; Nothing happened for perhaps thirty seconds, and then liz's form rippled, her clothing changed to a flowing white robe. &quot;Why don't you interrupt him?&quot;
&quot;Because he may not appreciate it. We want him to be open and honest with us. We'll wait a little while and see what happens.&quot;
&quot;Liz, you may not notice the difference, but all the angels seem to be constructs.&quot; I remarked. &quot;They have no auras. Many of the purportedly dead people do not have auras either, and a few who do don't have human auras.&quot;
&quot;I can't see any auras.&quot;
&quot;Can you see any colors around our own forms?&quot; I remarked.
&quot;You're right danny. I noticed the angels right away, it's expected, but why the deceased? And what's with the non humans?&quot; nalini wondered.
&quot;Curiouser and curioser.&quot; I replied.
&quot;Why?&quot; liz asked. She seemed to be going cross-eyed staring at my arm.
&quot;Because these regions tend to attract spirits that are similar. The angels are like the waiters in the cafes back in the university region, they give the place its atmosphere. Danny, do you think this is fairly recent?&quot;
&quot;Probably, but why create constructs to resembled deceased? Is it that people want to feel there are crowds of other humans around them, or does someone have something to hide?&quot;
&quot;Hmmm. It's possible some deceased want to create their idea of heaven, and they want other good christians around them, so they unconsciously create them, but why the non humans? If anything, there are more of them than humans.&quot;
Liz interrupted with &quot;I get an impression of yellow and blue.&quot;
&quot;Good. Listen, we won't do any exercises here, it might disturb something. But you are on the right track.&quot;
Some of the non humans were circling around us a bit like sharks. We three held hands again, and floated away, inspecting some of the stained glass windows. Nalini commented &lt;&lt;Sharks is a good analogy. I don't think they are that friendly toward us.&gt;&gt;.
One of the non human humans approached us. There was no chord, meaning it wasn't a dreamer, but an inhabitant. The aura wasn't egg shaped like human auras, but elongated and flattened a bit like the top of a mushroom. The aura was filled with orange and yellow spikes that flckered like flame.
Aloud I commented &quot;Let's all think thoughts of visiting the christian heaven, and feeling elated to be here.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot; liz replied. &quot;This stained glass is beautiful!&quot; She's good that way, she seems to know when to simply follow orders and not ask questions.
The figure glided up to us. &quot;Greetings. You are visiters here.&quot; He appeared to be a man in late middle age, greying shoulder length hair, greying spade beard, a sort of Charlton Heston playing Moses look about him. He beamed a smile.
&quot;It's so wonderful here!&quot; Nalini gushed. &quot;The angels, the singing, it's beautiful!&quot;
&quot;It is isn't it? This is the heaven promised in the scriptures. If you are religious enough in life, and follow all of god's strictures, you will come here after death.&quot;
&quot;All these people here must be the blessed, the saved?&quot;
&quot;Oh yes indeed, all these people are those who are saved. Let me show you more of our magnificent scenery.&quot;
We drifted past more stained glass, but nalini and i were subtly guiding us in a circle around cromwell. &quot;May we ask who you were in life?&quot;
&quot;You may. I am saint Augustine.&quot;
&lt;&lt;And I'm a monkey!&gt;&gt;&quot;Ah, the blessed person who brought christianity to England.&quot;
&quot;The very same sir. Let me show you this beautiful icon over here.&quot;
We made sure that one of nalini or myself was facing cromwell. After a few minutes he finished praying and got to his feet. A Jesus like figure appeared beside him.
&quot;Oh! We're all dressed in white; who is that man in black? Isn't black supposed to be an evil color?&quot;
&quot;Oh no, black is the sign of the penitent man. You three are alive, by rights you should be wearing black as well, because you cannot claim to be saved until the deciding moment of your deaths.&quot;
&quot;That is true isn't it? How do we change into black?&quot;
He began to explain about thinking pennance, feeling sorry for out sins, letting sorrow fill our hearts. We drifted over to cromwell. It was exactly the sort of thing a normal dreamer might do, having noticed something. We tuned him down, and stared at cromwell.
&quot;He's crying, he must be penitent.&quot; nalini commented.
&quot;Do you think he has many sins on his conscience?&quot; I wondered.
Cromwell was talking to the Jesus figure. &quot;My lord, I am not worthy of you presence, I am but a miserable worm! I do your bidding, but it is so hard to keep to the straight and narrow. Temptation is rife!&quot;
We continued to deliberately talk in circles, much as ordinary dreamers might. We wanted to talk to cromwell, but we could not do that while these others were around.
&quot;He has many sins on his conscience.&quot;
&quot;He doesn't look like a worm.&quot;
The Jesus figure replied &quot;Destroying the devil's handywork is often hard. I help where I can, but I need your physical body to make things happen. The king has been captured this night, you must try him tomorrow, and have him executed as soon as you can. He is one of satan's main servants, his execution will be a major blow to his master.&quot;
&quot;Who is the devil's sepent?&quot;
&quot;Whoever he is, he has to be pruned, and cut off.&quot;
&quot;The poor man has to fight with the devil?&quot;
Cromwell replied &quot;Then it will be done my lord. But it may be hard to convince the others we must execute the king.&quot;
&quot;Never fear, my saints are talking with them, they will support you. But it must be done here, if you take him to london, his master will arrange his rescue.&quot; The Jesus figure replied.
&quot;Is there no way the devil can be banished or destroyed?&quot; we asked the purported st. Augustine.
Cromwell asked &quot;But will not the devil harm us when we kill his servant?&quot;
The Jesus figure replied &quot;He will try, but I will protect you. Do not burn him, the deed must be done swiftly, his head must be removed.&quot; He turned to look directly at us.
&quot;Isn't that the Saviour?&quot;
&quot;I'm sure it is!&quot;
&quot;Jesus, let us worship you!&quot; We fell to our knees, and bowed low. The Jesus figure turned back to his conversation with Cromwell.
Cromwell continued &quot;We must convene parliament so the trial and execution is done legally.&quot;
&quot;But be swift about it, it must be done tomorrow, otherwise the devil will arrange to rescue him.&quot; the Jesus figure retorted.
Cromwell bowed low. &quot;Of course my lord! Your wish is my command.&quot; I think he meant it.
&quot;You may go.&quot; The Jesus figure placed his right hand upon cromwell's head in benediction. He turned toward us again. &quot;Augustine, have these three syncophants removed, they irritate me!&quot; He removed his hand from cromwell.
The st. Augustine figure replied &quot;With pleasure!&quot;
Nalini and I grabbed liz and immediately left, returning to hover in cromwell's bedroom. The room itself was spartanly furnished, a large bed, a writing desk with a hard backed chair, a small cupboard, a small wash-stand holding a pitcher of water and a basin, and a cupboard or wardrobe. The walls bore light squares as if paintings had been recently removed. I suspected that a larger and more ornate wardrobe had also been removed, because the narrow one had a large light square on the wall beside it.
Liz commented indignantly &quot;They were all phonies!&quot;
I nodded. Nalini replied &quot;They aren't even human, they have some hidden agenda, and they are working through cromwell. He should be here any minute, we'll take him to the cafe and try to talk.&quot;
Almost on cue, Cromwell appeared in the bedroom. He saw us and said &quot;Oh! What do you want?&quot;
We were still all dressed in white, looking a lot like angels. Nalini replied &quot;I'm sorry to disturb you lord cromwell, but we must talk with you urgently. This will not take long. Please come with us.&quot;
He nodded amiably. &quot;Very well, but it will be dawn in an hour or so, I always rise before dawn.&quot;
&quot;Come liz. Let's go.&quot; Nalini and i took hold of his arms gently, and took us to the street of outdoor cafes.
Cromwell looked around in wonder. Nalini asked &quot;Would you sit and take tea or coffee, or would you prefer to walk the gardens?&quot;
&quot;I am not immune to the beauty of god's creation. I think I should like to walk the gardens a little. Where is this?&quot;
&quot;This is part of the holy city. Sir, you are a pious and godly man. May I begin by asking you a few questions.&quot; Nalini asked. We crossed the street towards the garden.
&quot;Certainly.&quot;
I let nalini turn on the charm, and floated beside liz. One of those truncated telegraph poles was cruising near by, I beckoned it over. &quot;Can you transform to look like us and come with us?&quot;
&quot;I can. How is this?&quot; It resembled a beautiful angel, with blond shoulder length hair, blue eyes, pale skin and white rainment. Its voice was light, neither male nor female, but possessing qualities of both.
&quot;I would like to ask you some questions about a place we visited inadvertently.&quot;
&quot;Can you picture it for me?&quot;
I ran my mind back over the place, and created images in my mind as i would if i wished to share them telepathically with nalini. The guide would see them just as clearly.
&quot;Ah. The region resembles one of your versions of heaven, but it is not a human creation. As you noted, most of the inhabitants are constructs. Those other creatures are inimical to humans. I am surprised they did not fall upon you and devour you.&quot;
&quot;They can do that?&quot;
&quot;They can. They are vampiric creatures, who thrive on the strong emotions of fear and hate, draining you in the process. They can devour your dreaming bodies, draining them of their energy until they dissipate.&quot;
&quot;What happens then? Our dreaming bodies survive death of the physical body.&quot;
&quot;It is called the Final Death. Your physical body would be untenanted but alive, an entity such as they could inhabit it for a time. Their vibrations are not compatible, and the human body would die within days. Your dreaming body would die, and you would be reduced to your spirit body. That would be much reduced, and you would be forced to start over again. Your personality, all your memories would cease to exist. While a spark would continue, it would not be the you that stands before me.&quot;
&quot;How dificult it is for them to do that?&quot;
&quot;If they come to you, they must change their vibrations to match those of humans; that makes it almost impossible to drain a human. Instead they must drag that human back to their region by changing the vibrations of the human, and then they can drain that human. If they have created an environment for humans, they cannot drain those who enter there.&quot;
&quot;Can they trap someone who does? Change their vibrations?&quot; Liz asked first.
&quot;You all are reasonably safe, it is difficult to attack a dreamer who has control of their dreaming body. Someone who doesn't is a different matter. However, there are many predators out there, you are not truly safe unless you accept our offer. We are immune, if you stay with us, you would also be immune.&quot;
I had to chuckle at this &quot;And lose our freedom to exist in our physical bodies? Lose our freedom to reincarnate? Methinks the price is somewhat high.&quot;
&quot;But your dreaming bodies would be free to roam anywhere, to visit places that are barred to you as you are, and they would be truly immortal.&quot;
I didn't reply to that. I would explain to liz later, that one day they would make such an offer to her, that she would have to reject their offer herself, that once rejected, the guides would be less visible, less interested in her doings.
&quot;So what do they want with cromwell?&quot; I mused.
&quot;That is a metter for speculation. I believe he is in a position to create a climate of fear and hatred. It is also possible they are the tools of some other entity. I can tell you nothing else.&quot;
&quot;You could investigate.&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;I guess you would be helping humans then. Well thanks for what you've told us. You don't have to stay if you don't want to.&quot;
We had strolled across the park to a lake, fed by a small channel that lead to the river. Ducks, white and black swans, and some other water birds swam about. There was a gazebo near by with some seats. Nalini and cromwell were heading toward the gazebo.
&quot;I will stay out of curiosity. But first I would like to exchange energies with you, and perhaps the woman&quot; it indicated nalini &quot;in appreciation of the information I shared.&quot;
&quot;Very well.&quot; We hugged for about thirty seconds, during which time there was an exchange of energies, something like a flow of watery electricity, and a lot like an orgasm.
&quot;What was all that about?&quot; liz asked after I disengaged. Nalini was walking back with cromwell, who was staring in rapt wonderment at the angel.
I turned to Liz &quot;I'll have to explain in detail later, but this is sharing and exchanging energies. You don't have enough to interest it yet, nalini and I do. It's something like an orgasm, it's what real sex should be about, where you and your partner raise energies and then exchange them. Hold still for a moment, I'll share a little with you.&quot;
I hugged liz briefly, sharing some of the energies with her. She had very little to give back, but she shivered and made a little noise. &quot;I see what you mean.&quot; Nalini and cromwell were almost with us. &quot;I'll ask afterwards.&quot;
&lt;&lt;She looked like she enjoyed that!&gt;&gt; nalini laughed at me. She turned ot the angel, and said aloud &quot;Greetings holy angel. It is good to see you again.&quot; They hugged for about thirty seconds.
&quot;It is good to see you again too nalini.&quot; the angel replied. When they broke the clinch, it turned to cromwell, offered its hand. &quot;You will forgive me if I do not hug you.&quot;
Nalini moved behind cromwell, and hugged liz briefly as well. Liz looked surprised but pleased. Then she turned to me. &lt;&lt;Our turn.&gt;&gt; We hugged, but there wasn't time now for anything serious. That would probably have to wait until we woke up.
Cromwell looked more solid, brighter; I assumed the guide had given him some energy.
Cromwell turned to all of us. He seemed happy, but puzzled. &quot;I am not accustomed to hugging, except with my children. I have always thought it unseemly between adults, except perhaps between husband and wife in private. I had not thought a holy angel would behave like that.&quot;
The guide replied &quot;Sir, you know little of angels. God is love, love is expressed by hugging. But I know you are not comfortable with such displays, therefor I offered you only my hand.&quot;
Nalini said to me &quot;Danny, I need your help to take with Lord Cromwell. You can explain things to him better than I can.&quot;
I nodded. My own knowledge of the bible is better than nalini's, and to convince Cromwell, we would need to quote scripture at him. &quot;Where have you got up to?&quot;
&quot;Oh, he is aware that he is dreaming, that god has arranged this meeting in the spirit. We've talked a little about his hopes for England, but I have told him we wish to prevent further bloodshed.&quot;
Cromwell turned to me. &quot;I am well aware that people are dying in the fighting. I too would prefer to prevent further bloodshed. The civil war is not good for England, but we fight an evil disease, the disease must be burned out, otherwise the body will die of it.&quot;
I indicated the gazebo. &quot;Then let us sit here and talk on it. I know we all have limited time now, we might not cover everything tonight.&quot;
The guide remarked &quot;I can arrange that the Lord Protector does not awaken until we have finished our discussion.&quot;
&quot;Within reason, please sir angel.&quot; cromwell replied. &quot;I have duties to perform, I must arise by sunrise.&quot;
I was marshalling my thoughts as we sat. &quot;Surely your duty to god is paramount?&quot; I asked mildly. This had to be done softly, without pressure. We had to lead him to certain conclusions, not bully him there.
Cromwell pursed his lips, inclined his head. &quot;You are right of course. God has ordered this meeting, if that means I must sleep late to finish it, then that it god's will.&quot;
I nodded. &quot;I will endeavor to keep this meeting no longer than necessary. Firstly, I must quote St. Paul to you. 'Even satan can disguise himself as an angel of light'...&quot;
&quot;The second epistle to the corinthians, I believe.&quot;
I nodded and continued &quot;..and again 'For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, the powers of the prince of the air, against the forces of darkness'...&quot;
&quot;The epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 6 verse 12, although the words are slightly different from the King James text. That text is my guide, for I have put on my armor of god, to stand firm in battle against the evil one.&quot; His eyes were alight.
I smiled at him. &quot;Knowing this, you should also know 'therefor you must test what ever is said to you in god's name against the holy word. If it conforms then it is true, but if it does not, then it is false'...&quot;
He looked thoughtful. &quot;I have certainly heard that, but is it Corinthians, or perhaps Timothy?&quot;
&quot;I think St. Paul writes similar words in several of his letters. But I must ask you to take that maxim to heart, to think on everything you have been advised, even by those you met earlier tonight, and carefully compare what you were told against scripture, to test whether it be truth.&quot;
He looked at me sharply. &quot;I met with our Holy Savior earlier tonight. Surely you do not mean...&quot;
&quot;My lord cromwell, god does not usually lead people by the hand, or by the nose like cattle. When he instructs, it is usually in parables, for those who have ears. He expects people to make their own minds up. He gave us free will, he created the evil one so that we could exercise our free will. If there were no free will, there would be no need of salvation.&quot; 
He had been nodding, not he wrinkled his brow. &quot;That is an unusual idea, but I think you are correct. Without free will, we would be unable to choose evil, we would be unable to sin. So it follows that if there is salvation, we must be free to choose it, or to choose evil, and that implies the devil must exist.&quot;
I nodded. I wanted him to do most of the hard work, partly because I could not always remember the reasoning, and partly because if he worked it out, he would understand, and likely agree.
&quot;And so the devil tries to persuade us to depart from the path of salvation. For the crude and the simple minded, he uses the pleasures of the flesh, but for those who are educated, and pious, he puts on a semblance of piety, and endeavors to corrupt our understanding from within. I am not permitted to say whether you met with the savior earlier, but I have to ask that you test everything he said against scripture, to determine whether it was indeed the savior, or the devil himself.&quot;
His face looked pinched, narrowed, as if he would shut out what I was saying. &quot;So, I may have met with Our Savior, or I may have met with the devil. How do I know you are not the devil, seeking to disuade me from doing god's holy work?&quot;
&quot;On the surface, you don't know that. All I ask is that you hear what I say in good faith, and then test what I tell you against scripture. I am not asking you to do this now, but when you awaken, write down what you can remember, and then check those statements against your bible.&quot;
He nodded, his face relaxing. &quot;This is a deep consideration. But I must not be naive and assume that all dreams are from god. There can be no harm from checking against my bible. God's word will always be in accord with holy scripture.&quot;
He was still on side, listening. &quot;There are more issues we must cover. I have to ask you some questions. Which is more important, the Old Testament, or the New Testament?&quot;
&quot;Well sir, I do not hold with these modern notions that the new testament is all we need study. Both are the word of god, both are equally important.&quot;
&quot;Modern notion? I think it has been around since the time of the apostles. But perhaps I did not phrase my question correctly. I know you to be a pious man, do you follow all the prescriptions and proscriptions of the old testament, or those of the new testament, or both?&quot;
&lt;&lt;What are you getting at?&gt;&gt; nalini thought at me.
&lt;&lt;Moving him away from the burnings and the inquisition.&gt;&gt;.
&quot;Why both of course sir! They are both god's holy word, they are both to be equally obeyed. Jesus said 'Not one jot nor tittle will pass away from this law' &quot;
I nodded. &quot;Certainly true. But sir, I believe that as a good christian, you do not follow all the strictures of the old testament. Let us considere leveticus, with its religious practices and dietry rules. Do you follow those?&quot;
He pursed his lips, looking a little testy. &quot;I am not sure where you are leading. I do not follow the practices laid out in leveticus, although there are some who claim we should. I believe they are wrong. Is that what you are getting at?&quot;
I nodded. &quot;Good! This is important groundwork for what follows. Can you explain why we should not follow leveticus?&quot;
&quot;Hmm, I think I see where you are leading. Leveticus is about jewish religious practices. They pertain to the old covenant, we have the new covenant, so we are exempt from those observances.&quot;
&quot;You are correct sir. Now, can you support your assertion from scripture?&quot;
He looked hard at me for a moment, sucked his lower lip, then said &quot;Sir, I would need my bible at hand to support this properly, but I believe that in Acts there is a passage about allowing the gentiles into the christian faith. Until that time it had been for jews alone, and they still followed jewish law. Gentiles were exempted from following any jewish religious practices. St. Paul also writes at length in several of his epistles.&quot;
&quot;Romans is the one you are looking for, plus Hebrews. Paul writes at length about what became known as the circumcision debate. It was more much than a debate about physical circumcision, because to the jew circumcision stands for obediance to the law of the old testament. It is their symbol of the old covenant. I amsure you are aware of this.&quot; He nodded. &quot;There are several important points you will also be aware of&quot; I began ticking them off on my fingers.
&quot;First, jewish law is about righteousness, not salvation. Jesus came to offer salvation because righteousness is not sufficient. Second, he was the sacrificial lamb under jewish law. The sin offering took away the sin, but it wasn't sufficient, because it had to be offered each week. God, in offering his son, made a blood sacrifice that took away all sin for all people, for all time. Another blood sacrifice is not needed. Third, God created a new covenant with this action, which swept away jewish law. If you follow jewish law, then you must flollow all of it, and be righteous, but you lose your salvation. If you would be saved, then you must accept god's offer, and depart from jewish law.&quot;
Cromwell was nodding. &quot;I am aware of that reasoning. You put it very succinctly.&quot;
&quot;Your knowledge of scripture makes that possible. The old testament is about the old covenant, and about being righteous, and about death for the non righteous. Compassion does not rate a mention. The new testament is about the new covenant, about salvation, and compassion.&quot;
Cromwell was nodding, but there was a light in his eyes that said he was hearing things in a way he hadn't quite heard before. &quot;Well sir, perhaps you could tell me which parts of the old testament we should follow? Because you raise a thorny problem.&quot;
I smiled at him. &quot;Sir, the old testament is to be read as god's old covenant, where he is the righteous god, the jealous god, the angry god. This is how he could be if we revert to that old covenant. There are many passages where god's pronouncements or behaviour conflicts with the new testament. Those passages have to be understood as not applying to christians, just as jewish law cannot apply to christians. Even the ten commandments sir...&quot;
&quot;That's preposterous sir! Are you saying we abrogate the ten commandments?&quot;
&quot;No sir, we are not proposing to abrogate the ten commandments, but that they should be read in the light of the new testament, and the words of Jesus. But let me ask you how many people have died in your name? In direct contraconvention of the commandment 'thou shalt not kill'?&quot; He looked angry, but he also looked as if he was forced to agree with me. &quot;Sir, your whole campaign of rooting out evil, of burning witches...&quot;
&quot;We do not burn them sir, we hang them! We are not barbaric!&quot;
&quot;Witches that your inquisitors seek out with techniques they have learned from Torquemada and the spanish inquisition? Drop them bound in ponds, if they float they are witches, if they drown they are innocent? That is neither just nor compassionate.&quot; I spoke softly, deliberately, not wanting to anger him more than necessary. &quot;Torture them till they confess, prick their moles until you find one that is less sensitive... sir, you have moles aplenty on your face, were you to be arreigned before your own witch inquisitors, they would declare you a witch. Innocent people are suffering, because their neighbours can claim their property if they are convicted. You are obeying the old testament, and disobeying the new! Our god is a loving father, not a cruel tyrant. You as lord protector must stand as loving father to all the people of england, not just those who are puritans.&quot;
His anger was abating. &quot;I admit I have felt misgivings about some of what has been happening, but the Lord commands in the old testament &quot;thou shalt not suffer a witch to live'!&quot;
&quot;Yes, they stand condemned because they break the first commandment. And it also says that adulterers must be stoned, along with all who break any of the other commandments. Would you stone all adulterers, all soldiers, all theives, any who ride upon an ass or horse on sunday, and all who report a witch, because they covet their neighbour's property? Must I remind you of Jesus' words? 'I give you two commandments. The first is...'&quot; he joined in at this point, quoting with me &quot;'...thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. The second is like the first. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself'&quot; he stopped quoting at this point. I continued &quot;'from these two commandments hang the law and all the prophets'&quot;
&quot;But we have always followed everything in the old testament, except for that which is obviously jewish religious practices.&quot;
&quot;Even when it does not accord with the teachings of jesus or the apostles.&quot; Earnestness crept into my voice. &quot;Sir if you would truly reform your church and your faith, then you must read the old testament, and classify every pronouncement as either in accord with the new testament, and so to be observed, or as not in accord, and so to be read as jewish law no longer applicable. Jesus did not condemn people to death, he saved them, he forgave them their sins. The pharasees may have been evil, but jesus did not punish them, he waited for god to do so in god's own time.&quot;
He snorted. &quot;What you say about the old testament makes good sense, but it would take years to resolve every verse! Are you saying we should not condemn the witches and the devil worshippers?! They blight crops, they sour milk, they perform all manor of unspeakable acts!&quot;
I spoke slowly and deliberately. &quot;God will judge each and every one of them. You have his sure promise of that in the new testament. Where public order is at stake, then may you judge them, but judge them for the crime they commit, on good evidence, not on hearsay. Many so called witches are midwives, who also prepare a few herbs to help heal the sick. You would not comdemn the physician or the apothecary as witches, so why condemn the midwives?&quot;
&quot;Are you saying that many who have been condemned as witches or devil worshippers are not guilty?&quot;
&quot;Yes sir, many of them are innocent, their cries go up before god. They are condemned because they are old, or catholic, or jewish, or foreign, or disliked by their village. The village idiot is condemned, the local land holder is condemned by his tenants, the young girl in a fit of hysteria throws herself at a good puritan, he refuses her advances, she denounces him, he is condemned, she is free. The whole witch inquisition is a mockery, and a travesty of justice.&quot;
&quot;Surely not sir! My inquisitors are supposed to inquire most carefully, and sift the evidence. No witch is condemned unless she or he confesses.&quot;
&quot;A confession that is extracted with pain, or by depriving them of sleep for days, and badgering them until they do not know what they are doing. England has a tradition that a person is innocent until proven guilty. A judge must be a shrewd man to determine what the witnesses will gain by a conviction. Yet your laws reward their accusers with the property of the condemned. Any judge will tell you this will bring out many false accusations.&quot;
He was beginning to look less sure of himself. &quot;There could be some truth in what you say. I must look into it. It would be terrible of some of those who have been condemned were convicted on false evidence. I did no really want to be Lord Protector, you know. I have tried to remove evil from this land, and make it a godly place.&quot;
&quot;It is a noble endeavor, but please beware self righteousness. Every person must fight their own fight with the devil. Each person must reject the devil themselves, you cannot reject the devil on behalf of anyone else. You can make the land a godly place, but you cannot achieve it by banishing evil, you can only achieve it by teaching people the christian way. You cannot banish evil from the land, but you can teach people to banish evil from their own hearts.&quot;
He was nodding at most of what I said. &quot;Why do you claim we cannot banish evil from the land?&quot;
&quot;The devil is set there with god's permission, of that you may be sure. He has leave to tempt people, that they may exercise their own free will. God wants each and everyone of us to reject the devil and his works, but if you banish the devil, no one would know of him, they would have no choice. They could not decide to reject the devil, they could not be saved.&quot;
&quot;I have heard discussions along that line before. Your premis may be correct. Are you saying we should not root out evil? How can rooting out the devil's works be bad? How else can we prove we have rejected him?&quot;
&quot;You do not need to prove it to your fellow men. God sees what is in your heart. Trying to remove evil people, and evil practices is commendable, but when you use the devil's own techniques then the innocent suffer, while most of the guilty go free. God will judge everyone, you do not need to follow the catholic practice of burning evil doers in the hope of saving them from the fires of hell....&quot;
&quot;Sir, we do not burn them!&quot;
&quot;But I think you take my point. Except for the maintenance of good order, you should not be judging and condemning others, because that is god's prerogative. Your duty as a christian is to let them be, and show them by your own example why they should come to jesus of their own free will, and ask for forgiveness and salvation. By killing them, you deny them the chance of salvation, and that itself is a heinous crime. Thou shalt not kill! Love thy neighbour as thyself!&quot;
He looked stricken, which told me what I was saying was striking home. Many modern aspects of theology were probably novel ideas to him. &quot;But witches cause harm, as do devil worshippers!&quot;
&quot;Judge them by the harm they cause. Taking a life is a very serious consideration. Every time you take the life of someone who is not saved, you take it upon yourself to deny that person salvation. God will call you to account for each life. Think very carefully before doing so. You must show compassion if you would be christian. The inquisition must be dismantled, the civil war must be stopped, the persecution of non puritans must also be stopped. None of that is in accord with being a christian. You use the devil's methods.&quot;
He looked thoughtful and sad. &quot;Our savior was called the Prince of Peace. 'Blessed are the peacemakers' he said. But the one I met earlier told me that the war was against evil, and must continue until the last evil doer is killed.&quot;
&quot;'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.'.  and when none condemned her, he told her 'Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more.'&quot;
&quot;Have I been a fool, a tool of the evil one? Many things that have happened do not seem to stand up against jesus' own words.&quot; He was shaking his head.
&quot;None of us are perfect, but if we make mistakes, the correct thing to do is to acknowledge them, and set them to right. The evil thing is to cover them up, or behave as if they were right.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;My Lord Cromwell, you will wake soon. I urge you to write down as much as you can remember, as soon as you wake. Then you may evaluate what you have been told in the light of the scripture.&quot;
He looked wistful, thoughtful. &quot;You have given me much food for thought. I disagree with much of what you have said, but somehow I feel that what you have said is in accord with scripture. It is possible that we have done much harm while trying to do good. I shall think on it, I shall pray for guidance, I shall consult my bible. If harm has been done, then I shall undo it. You maybe sure that I will always base my actions on scripture.&quot;
The guide interrupted. &quot;It is time for Lord Cromwell to wake up now.&quot;
We thanked him for his time, and then he vanished. It would be time for us to wake up, seeing that the shadow we were staying in was ahead of cromwell's shadow.
I sighed with relief. Nalini praised me &quot;That was well done danny. He is partly convinced.&quot;
&quot;At least he is open minded enough to consider he may be wrong.&quot;
Liz commented &quot;Jeez danny, did you ever think of being a priest? You'd make old father Ryan proud of you.&quot;
I shook my head. &quot;I always used to argue with them. But I guess I soaked up enough in my theology classes. I used to be able to toss in more quotes, but I'm slowly forgetting them.&quot;
&quot;So does this mean he'll stop the civil war, and the witch inquisition?&quot;
Nalini and I both shook our heads. &quot;He may remember nothing. He may remember everything, but dismiss it as just a dream. All we have really proven is that he is not a monster, he is trying to be a good man. That means we can work with him....&quot;
&quot;But he is being guided by those things masquerading as Jesus and the saints.&quot; I added. &quot;You both heard what the guide said about them. They have some hidden agenda behind all this, they will not allow us to stop him without a fight. We will have our work cut out, and it will be dangerous.&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;Without those creatures, we could influence cromwell and probably convince him he is on a wrong path. Prospero could negotiate with them and king Charles, and we could all live happily ever after.&quot; She made a face. &quot;One of my beefs with korum was he was always off saving the world! Once I broke up with him I thought I was done with all that. This is the second time danny and I have been dragged into an adventure. Shit!&quot; She wasn't upset, merely sounding off.
I snorted &quot;Maybe we should blame prospero? Or paula? We've had little adventures with just the two of us, but they've both been involved in the big ones.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;You see liz, danny and I would possibly gone as far as rescuing prince rupert, but then we would have left him to his own devices, and gone on to Aquilonia.&quot;
I added half joking &quot;Maybe there is some sort of critical mass? The two of us are below that threshhold, but with three or more we're over it?&quot;
Liz asked &quot;But nalini, didn't you tell me that this sort of thing went with becoming a sorcerer? Something about the workings of power?&quot;
Nalini nodded. &quot;Unfortunately it does. You develop power, you travel through shadows, you will cross places where your power can make a difference. That mysterious world out there will ask you to make a difference. You can choose to walk on by, but we choose to repay... what ever it is, we choose to repay by helping, and trying to make that difference. We have to get back, have a council of war with the others. We'll see you at breakfast. Don't forget what you've seen!&quot;
We woke not long after sunrise, implying that in this shadow time moved more slowly than in cromwell's. We put ourselves first for a while, and made love before we washed, dressed and descended for breakfast.

            <Text>Chapter 4
When we arrived for breakfast, Liz and Rupert were already there. Liz was eating a bowl of fruit, Rupert was eating bread rolls spread with honey, and had a large cup of milky coffee. They were talking desultorily. I wondered what she had told him of last night.
Prince rupert looked up, greeted us and then said &quot;Liz tells me that you have news.&quot;
&quot;We do. Has she told you anything?&quot;
&quot;No, I only told him you had news.&quot; Liz replied in his stead.
&quot;That's good liz. Rupert, we will get some breakfast, and then tell you. I would prefer to wait for paula and prospero, assuming they will be here soon.&quot; nalini replied.
I helped myself to fruit, noodles and coffee. Nalini eshewed the noodles, and went for a rice dish. There was a smorgasbord of small steamed things like dim sims and buns, several noodle dishes, two rice dishes, a large mess of scrambled eggs with cheese and soy sauce, and a large basket of bread rolls. There were no cereals. I spooned a dollop of eggs onto my noodles.
We passed paula and prospero on our way back to our table. They were both looking pleased with themselves, giving me a hint that they were late for the same reason nalini and I were late.
Prospero returned carrying a laden tray. He had taken one of every steamed thing he could find, plus small helpings of noodles, rice and eggs. &quot;Prospero, could you fit any more on the tray? I'm sure you must have left something behind.&quot;
He grinned at me &quot;I'm sure I have too, but this is probably more than I can eat as it is. I have to keep my strength up though, and I can't pass up an opportunity to taste different gourmet delights.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;If you eat all that, you'll start growing sideways!&quot;
&quot;Hey! You keep telling us that breakfast is the most important meal.&quot;
Paula returned with a plate of bread rolls. &quot;There's no cereal!&quot; she complained. She broke a roll and began spreading jam on it from one of the small pots on the table.
&quot;It probably hasn't been invented here yet.&quot;
Rupert looked at her with a puzzled expression. &quot;The bread is made from wheat, and perhaps corn, the noodles are also made from wheat or rice, and there is rice itself. How can you say there are no cereals?&quot;
Paula giggled, and then explained about breakfast cereal to rupert. She went into such detail that prospero finnaly complained &quot;Stop it paula, you're making me hungry!&quot;
We kept the others in suspense until nalini and I had finished the major part of our breakfast. Nalini eats less than I do, so she started first.
&quot;Danny and I went dreaming last night, and we discovered a few things. Firstly, king charles was captured while we slept, and is being conveyed to Cromwell's manor...&quot;
&quot;We must do something right away!&quot; rupert exclaimed.
&quot;We will, as soon as we decide what to do. There is much more to tell. Secondly, there are a number of beings... er... we might just call them demons, that have contacted Cromwell, and give him orders. They masquerade as jesus and his apostles. They have ordered Cromwell to have the king executed as soon as possible. This will be either late today, or early tomorrow morning.&quot;
There was a look of horror on Rupert's face. &quot;May god forbid!&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;They also influence the rest of the gang of seven that control the rump parliament. Comwell will insist that things are done legally, so there must be a trial for treason and witchcraft. That will probably happen today, which is why the execution may not take place until tomorrow morning.&quot;
She turned to me &quot;We also had a long talk with Cromwell, or at least danny did...&quot;
&quot;Essentially we tried to convince him his current actions are contrary to his scriptures, and that what he thinks are jesus and his apostles are really demons. He is not convinced, but we have sown the seeds of doubt. If he can be convinced, he will stop the civil war, dismantle the inquisition, and do what he can to stop the persecution. But that won't happen while those creatures can influence him. They will do what they can to stop us, once they become aware of us. I don't think they are aware of us yet, but they feel our interference. Cromwell was told to have the trial at his manor, because if he had the king transported to london, we would rescue him.&quot;
&quot;We should be off right away! It is half a day's ride to Cromwell's manor, our best chance of rescuing the king is while he is on the road.&quot;
Nalini shook her head. &quot;We can get to Cromwell's manor in ten or fifteen minutes from here. Our best chance of rescuing him is not on the road, where there will be a heavy escort, but from his prison cell, where they will be least expecting it. Don't worry prince rupert, we will rescue him.&quot;
Prince rupert nodded. &quot;Very well, I accept your assurances.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;What is your assessment of cromwell?&quot;
&quot;He's pious, but basically decent. I'd say he's undergoing some soul searching right now, because he will be realizing that what he has been doing is not in accord with his beliefs. It will take more work, but I think he can be persuaded. Provided we can get rid of those other entities.&quot;
&quot;So you think he would negotiate?&quot;
&quot;I believe so. He gave me the impression he was not happy with the bloodshed and the witch inquisition.&quot;
Liz asked &quot;How dangerous are those other entities?&quot; It was possible she did not remember all the details of last night.
&quot;I spoke with one of the guides, it seemed to think that they could drain us and kill us, but while they masquerade as humans they are relatively harmless.&quot;
&quot;Ah, this is some new meaning of the word harmless&quot; prospero quipped &quot;one with which I am not familiar.&quot;
&quot;To interact with humans, they must change their vibrations or ours. If they come to us, they change theirs, and so render themselves relatively harmless. If they drag us back to their region, they must change ours, and then they can destroy us.&quot;
&quot;Hmmm, I think I prefer battling soldiers. At least you can see what you are up against.&quot;
&quot;I think it will be Danny and I battling those creatures. You will be the one who negotiates the peace treaty.&quot;
Prince rupert asked &quot;If you are going to Cromwell's manor, I must go somewhere else. Many there would recognize me.&quot;
&quot;We can make you look different enough that you will not be recognized. However, when it comes time to act, we might leave you with Liz. It will be safer for both of you to be out of the way when the action starts. The four of us can shadow shift, you two cannot, we will find an appropriate shadow, and leave you there.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;Could we also capture Cromwell and the er.. gang of seven?&quot;
&quot;We could. There would be risks of course, but I think danny and can recognize most of them.&quot;
The discussion continued over coffee for perhaps half an hour before we checked out of the hotel. We rode a little way down the street before nalini and i worked on rupert to make him appear different. This time we lent him a mirror so he could see himself.
He shook his head in amazement &quot;I would never have believed this possible! I don't feel any different though.&quot;
&quot;No, it's an illusion. You are still the same, but for the next twelve hours or people will see you like this. It'll wear off after that.&quot; I replied.
Nalini added &quot;We must give you a different name, and invent a history for you.&quot;
&quot;I shall call myself Jan, a dutch engineer. I am here studying the English railway system, for.... er... who are you supposed to be employed by?&quot;
&quot;The Viceroy of india.&quot; nalini replied promptly. &quot;That is a great idea, studying the railway system. India could certainly benefit from a railway. Many of the roads are impassible in the monsoon season, and in many areas the roads are almost non existent.&quot;
&quot;Do they have a viceroy here?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Maybe it's ony a govenor, but I don't think anyone will know.&quot;
&quot;How about the king of Aquilonia?&quot; prospero asked. &quot;We all know him, except for you rupert. Aquilonia is north of india, toward russia and china.&quot;
We argued back and forth, but prospero and rupert argued for being foreign nobles, holding it safer than anything else.
He maintained &quot;Why not stick closely to the truth? I am the diplomatic envoy from aquilonia, you are my entourage. Prince rupert can by my cousin Yanos, the Earl of Bosna.&quot;
That settled, we performed some preparations, and then rode of through shadow, arriving outside the gates of Cromwell's manor about fifteen minutes later. Nalini and I rode at the front, Prospero and Paula behind us, with rupert and liz behind them. Guards challenged us.
I put on a bored voice and told them &quot;We are the diplomatic mission from aquilonia, here to present our credentials to the lord protector. Please arrange for admittance, and lodgings for us.&quot;
The guards looked at each other. One of the guards gulped and made a noise.
&quot;Don't just stand there soldier! If you do not have the authority to admit us, then fetch someone who does!&quot;
&quot;Uh yes sir!&quot; one of the guards ran off, returned a few minutes later with the captain, who was still strapping his helmet on.
&quot;Captain Winters at your service sir. How may I help you?&quot;
&quot;Good day to you captain. I am the Earl of Bendora,&quot; the captain stiffened slightly &quot;Our party is the diplomatic mission from Aquilonia. We are here on official business. We will need to speak with the Lord Protector and possibly some of the parliamentarians. We will need accomodation for several nights. Would you be so kind as to allow us entry, and contact whomever is responsible for arranging this?&quot;
&quot;Er.. Yes sir. Er... this is a formality of course, but would you have a letter of commission or something to confirm this?&quot;
&quot;Of course captain.&quot; I turned to nalini, who took a folded sheet of paper from her saddle bag. We had prepared this earlier with sorcery, after we had decided on this course of action. She handed it to the captain, who unfolded it, glanced at the official looking writing with the big crest, and handed it back. It occurred to me that he that he probably could not read well, or didn't want to be making trouble.
&quot;Thank you sir. We will arrange all this.&quot; He turned and barked orders to one of the guards. &quot;Fetch my horse, and send a runner to notify the manor we need to arrange accomodation for our guests. Have someone meet us at the entrance. And tell them they're foreign nobles, diplomats.&quot; We waited until the soldier returned with a saddled horse.
The captain mounted, and rode beside me, and lead us along the driveway for perhaps a kilometer and a half to the manor house.
&quot;If you don't mind me saying, you travel with a small party.&quot;
&quot;It attracts less attention this way. We do not seem like attractive targets for theives, it is easier to book passage on boats, and find accomodation.&quot;
&quot;But isn't that dangerous? Especially travelling with women?&quot;
&quot;Only if we travel through wild areas. We are all armed, and we all know how to use our weapons.&quot;
&quot;Even the er... ladies sir?&quot;
I lent towards him and said conspiratorially &quot;The lady immediately behind me has killed more than one hundred people in combat. She is a fearsome warrior.&quot;
He turned round to look. Nalini smiled at him, her 'smile on the face of the tiger' expression as she terms it.
&quot;She does look ferocious doesn't she? Are there many like that over there?&quot;
&quot;She is the daughter of the Maharajah of delhi, she was trained from an early age. She was in charge of her father's bodyguard. Now she is mine.&quot; I let him ponder exactly what that might mean.
&quot;What is aquilonia like?&quot;
We told him tales of exotic cities, of Maharajahs with jewelled clothes, of elephants and peacocks, and more. Nalini probably told more tales than I did.
Eventually we reached the manor. Several flunkies were there to greet us. I made arrangements for rooms, with drawing rooms for office space. The head flunky looked us over, and almost sniffed. &quot;Sir, it is usual for servants to stay in servants quarters.&quot;
&quot;Ah, my good man!&quot; Prospero drew himself up, placed a hand on the flunky's shoulder, and spoke in that bored affected drawl that seems to come so naturally to aristocrats. &quot;My entourage does not include servants in the common sense. We expect you to provide servants for us. I am Prospero, duke of Poitain, the diplomatic envoy from Aquilonia, and this good lady is my wife. The gentlemen with me are my cousins. This is the earl of Bendora and his wife, she is a princess from delhi in India. This is her cousin, and this is my cousin the earl of Bosna. Now, if you would be so kind as to arrange our accomodation?&quot; His tone of voice let it be known that he was accustomed to instant obediance.
The flunky acquiesced. Grooms came to take our horses. Three liveried footmen took our bags and followed us as the chamberlain us through the ground floor of the central wing where he assigned two suites, each with two bedrooms opening onto a large drawing room. The two suites were not side by side, but were close by.
Maids scurried around opening shutters, making beds and airing the rooms. The chaimberlain informed us &quot;I'm afraid you have come at a time when the lord protector is very busy. You may not be able to see him for days, perhaps weeks. Would you like to meet with one of his deputies?&quot;
&quot;No. You are not a diplomat, you would not appreciate that meeting with a deputy is a subtle snub. We will present our credentials to the Lord Protector first. If you would be so good as to inform him that the delegation from aquilonia is here to see him, we will happily await his pleasure. If that takes weeks, then so be it. However, while we are waiting, should his deputies or other officials wish to hold informal meetings with us, then we will be happy to meet with them. Provided of course that it is understood that they are informal meetings. Official talks cannot begin until we have presented our credentials.&quot;
He bowed &quot;I will convey that sir.&quot; and left, though the servants fussed around for a while. We settled in, unpacking a few things, and fetching more things to put on the desks so we looked as if we had paperwork. Nalini and I fetched six copies of the king James version of the bible so that each of us would have a copy with us. They weren't new, most looked well worn. We weren't sure exactly where they had come from, and it is something we don't like doing except in emergencies. We also fetched a safe, into which we placed a bag containing our high tech stuff such as nalini's laptop, cameras, torches and the like.
I gathered everyone together and said &quot;There is every likelihood they will search our rooms and our luggage. Keep your valuables with you at all times, or in the safe. Now we're here, we should walk around and familiarize ourselves with the grounds, it's likely we will be here for some days. Don't do anything to make them suspicious of us, and try to stay in pairs.&quot;
&quot;And give them a chance to search our luggage?&quot; prospero inquired.
&quot;Yes. Meet back here in two hours.&quot;
Nalini and I walked around and talked to soldiers, to grooms, some of the kitchen hands in the main kitchen where we scrounged some food. We had to be careful what we asked, because our questions were sure to be reported on.
However, if you don't ask direct questions, but spend time getting to know people, it's surprising what they will volumteer.
The grooms told us that two heavy coaches with dragoon escorts had arrived a few hours before we had. Four occupants had been hooded and with their hands bound. They had been speculating about who they might have been. Nalini and i set the cat amongst the pidgeons by suggesting that one of them might have been the king.
The soldiers we spoke with did not mention the coaches, but did say that york would surrender today, handing over the royalists sheltering within its walls. They speculated about whether the king had escaped, or would be handed over.
At first the kitchen hands were not talkative. We thought this was because they thought we were nobles, so I told them &quot;We are bodyguards of the envoy from aquilonia. We only arrived an hour ago.&quot;
&quot;Wo', bofe ov ya?&quot; asked the scullery maid as she placed bowls of thick soup in front of us. Her north country accent could be cut with a knife.
&quot;Yes, both of us are body guards.&quot;
&quot;Cor! Oo'd believe I seen a woman body guard?&quot;
Nalini replied. &quot;Where we come from, women share the fighting with menfolk.&quot; She unstrapped her sword from her back, laid it on the table. &quot;I know how to use this.&quot;
&quot;Cor miss, ever kill anyone?&quot;
&quot;I'm nalini, this is my companion danny. Please call us by our names. Yes, we've killed a few people in our time.&quot;
They told us their names. We talked for some time about what we'd done, where we'd been, suitably edited of course. We asked a few questions about the kitchen hands in return, leading up to &quot;You must get a lot of guests here then.&quot;
&quot;Busiest we've ever been.&quot;
&quot;Some of them are trouble, let me tell you.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, all pious like in public, but take food to their rooms and they'll feel you up before you know it.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, them religious ones is the worst!&quot;
Nalini chuckled evilly. &quot;They wouldn't be so quick after i'd broken their arms!&quot;
We talked for some time about their guests. We'd shared information about ourselves, they now were happy to tell us about who was staying, where they were, and what strange or nasty habits they had. It was easy to learn who we should be targeting later.
One of them volunteered. &quot;We got four what come in this morning, theys prisoners or somethin'&quot;
&quot;How can you tell?&quot;
&quot;Oh, they got guards inside and outside their rooms.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, we done up a late breakfast for them, and kate and I had to take it in on trays. There's two guards outside, and another two inside.&quot;
&quot;They must be important then.&quot; nalini suggested. That lead to a round of speculation about who they might be. During that we suggested that one might be the king, and we managed to find out roughly where they were being held - the top floor of the old wing, where the windows were narrow slits too small for anyone to pass through, and the walls were several feet thick.
We finished our meal, and headed back to our rooms. The others were all there waiting for us. We checked a few things and discovered that our luggage had been disturbed.
&quot;How can you tell?&quot; liz asked.
I tapped the side of my nose and winked. Nalini replied &quot;I placed a couple of strands of my hair in certain places in our luggage. It isn't there now. They've managed to put things back more or less where they were, so they didn't want us to know. I daresay there is someone eavesdropping on us right now.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;I'm aware of that trick, but as a diplomatic envoy, I always assume that there are spies twenty four hours a day, and that everything is searched when ever they have a chance.&quot;
&quot;Well, we have nothing to hide.&quot;
&quot;You guys hungry?&quot; They all assented. &quot;Okay, let's go rustle up some food.&quot;
We left again, this time walking down the path toward the orchard. Once there, we shifted twice, coming to a small meadow with some flat topped boulders. The sky had shaded from pale pink to russet. Rupert commented &quot;I did not say anything when we were walking away from the house, because I suspected you intended to do something like this. We can talk freely here.&quot;
&quot;That's right. We shouldn't stay too long though. Did you people discover anything?&quot;
Rupert started &quot;I can tell you a lot about the troop dispositions, I can tell you that the king and three others arrived this morning, I can tell you that half the army has travelled to accept the surrender of York, and will be bringing back more royalist prisoners tonight.&quot;
Liz added &quot;We were careful not to ask too many questions, we don't want to be arrested as spies. We saw a lot of the grounds though, and there are lots of troops camped around and even more camped outside.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;Paula and I went for a walk, we spoke to some of the soldiers, and also found that the general gossip is the king is here. But then we went in search of a parliamentarian. We talked for a while about how the parliament works, and we discovered that the parliamentary leaders, I think they are those we are calling the gang of seven, will sit to try the king for treason and witchcraft this afternoon. The man we spoke with was unsure whether he would be included. He was a puritan, he seemed to feel it was his right.&quot;
Paula added &quot;We heard that there are three others with the king, they are going to be tried as well, but we don't know whether they'll tried with the king, or afterwards. Hey guys, I had to stand there and look interested while they talked about theories of parliament for ages!&quot; Looking at her now I realized she had removed her nose ring.
&quot;Okay, it's been productive. We found out the four are being held in a suite of rooms in the old wing, with guards inside and out side. It will probably be easiest to snatch them tonight, but that may depend on how long they take to try him today. I'm not in favor of crashing the trial, there will be a lot of guards.&quot;
&quot;Then again, the gang of seven will be there, we could capture all of them in one swoop!&quot; prospero suggested.
Rupert nodded. &quot;It is riskier, but if we can accomplish that we could end the civil war!&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Maybe I'm getting old, I'm in favor of the lower risk of rescuing him tonight. But we will reconoitre this afternoon to see if there are suitable shadows from which we can gain access to the court room, and determine how many guards there are. If there aren't too many, we will give it a try.&quot;
&quot;Don't forget there will be other prisoners arriving tonight. We should be considering rescuing them as well. If we snatch the king at night, no one need know, and we can then rescue the others.&quot; I commented.
Prospero commented &quot;The chances are someone will raise the alarm, unless we can somehow know them out and snatch them. If you grab someone who is sleeping, they will wake up in surprise, and call out. Think about it.&quot;
&quot;But if we do manage to snatch them all, the other prisoners will still be prisoners.&quot; I observed.
&quot;Then we can come back later for them. If we walk out behind guards, take important people hostage, we should be able to get in and out very quickly.&quot; prospero countered. &quot;A surgical strike I think it's termed.&quot;
&quot;You've been watching too much news!&quot;
We headed back, discovered from the kitchen that the main hall was serving lunch for the guests, so we sauntered in and grabbed a table. The food was fairly plain fare - vegetable soup which nalini and I had eaten in the kitchen earlier, bread and cheese, plus some sort of roast meat with boiled potatoes and mushy boiled vegetables. There were also jugs of dark brown ale.
Nalini and I had more soup, with bread and cheese. The ale was good, as was the bread and cheese. The soup was bland. Rupert ate with an appetite, the others complained about the food.
&quot;It needs salt!&quot; liz commented.
Paula added &quot;Erk, the vegies are all mushy!&quot;
Prospero tried the soup, the meat and the vegetables with a look of distaste on his face. &quot;Do you think they had the kitchen hand prepare this food? Surely no chef could produce anything this bad!&quot;
Nalini and I chuckled. Paula said &quot;Huh! This is typical English food.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;I don't think they use the term chef here, but they would have cooks. I agree with paula, this is typical english food, all mushy and with no flavor.&quot;
I added &quot;Prospero, there's a joke back home about how heaven has french chefs, english police, and german engineers, while hell has english chefs, german police and italian engineers. The english are very proud of their cooking, they claim the food is naturally flavored, with no garlic,herbs or spices to get in the way of the taste experience. You will also observe how easy it is for people with no teeth to eat this stuff. Of course, among the non english, english chefs have the reputation of being the worst in the world.&quot;
He shook his head sadly. &quot;I have encountered food this bad before, but only when on army field trips. That a nation should proudly claim this as the best they can offer, staggers me!&quot;
Rupert shrugged. &quot;You get used to it. Army food often isn't much better.&quot;
&quot;True, though I think our army would mutiny if you fed them food like this. But you don't serve army field rations to guests of the government, especially foreign nobles, unless they are in the field with the army.&quot;
&quot;The food at the court was better, but most of the cooks were english. The king did have four or five french chefs who would prepare better food for guests, but many of the english do not like food with flavorings. The french chef might prepare a dish with garlic, and most of the nobles would avoid it.&quot;
Prospero finally gave up on the food in disgust. &quot;My taste buds are rebelling! I'm going to play the diplomat, and go around the room talking to people.&quot; With that he stood up and walked over to the next table, where he started talking to people.
Rupert watched him, then remarked &quot;We should all be doing that, except that I feel people will recognize me.&quot;
Paula replied &quot;Prospero's like that back home. He's a senior diplomat, so of course he talks to people at any opportunity. He's always finding out who is influential, what they think and so on. I've set him up a computerized card index system so he can keep tabs on everyone. That way if he's meeting the ambassador from upper woop woop, he can read up on him, how many children he has, whether his wife likes flower arranging and all that stuff, and ask him personal questions. He thinks it's a wonderful idea!&quot;
&quot;Um... computerized? What are you doing for electricity?&quot;
&quot;Silly, have you forgotten that nalini gave us a solar powered lap top? It keeps itself charged up during the day, and it runs off batteries at night. With power saving and so on, you can leave it on all night without running flat.&quot;
We had bought several solar powered lap tops in nalini's home shadow, we even carried one with us now. Nalini needed one for the work she still did for clients in her home shadow, but I found it less useful simply because it would not talk to any known device in my home shadow.
Rupert had been turning his head, looking around the room. &quot;I cannot help feeling that people are staring at me, that they will recognize me any moment and raise the alarm.&quot;
&quot;Nah, that's just normal paranoia!&quot; liz commented. Rupert looked puzzled.
Nalini commented &quot;I don't think they are looking at you, but at all of us because we dress differently, and liz and i in particular because of our skin color. We are used to it. I think you could sit here with your normal face, and people would not see it because you are with us, and part of out group. Even people that know you might simply remark that you look like someone they know. People see what they expect to see. You expect them to look at you, so that is what you see.&quot;
                                ***
After lunch, nalini and i issued instructions to the others to be prepared to move at a moment's notice. Then we retired to our room, with instructions not to be disturbed. We had to return to the dreaming to reconoitre what was happening, where the shadows were. We needed access to the second floor, where the prisoners were, and we needed access to the large ground floor room that was being used as the parliament room, and had now become a court room. We needed a safe shadow in which to regroup.
We returned after about an hour. The others were all gathered in our drawing room, with their packs. Prospero spoke quietly &quot;There's a guard at our door.&quot;
&quot;They don't trust us then. Do we have everything here?&quot; The others nodded. &quot;Okay, let's shift.&quot;
Nalini thought to prop a chair behind the door in such a way that it prevented the door from opening.
We shouldered our packs, grabbed our weapons, and walked across the drawing room, shifting before we encountered the door. We were in another room, facing the door. I opened the door, we walked into the corridor and shifted again to yet another building, this time decrepit, walls with holes, floorboards rotting, dust and mildew everywhere. Then we shifted into an immense cavern, a broad flat expanse of blue tiles beneath us, blue green light filtering from huge glass panels overhead.
Next came a flattened hilltop under cloudy lavender skies. This was the partly filled in caldera of an extinct volcano. A stand of eucalypts grew nearby, and a small stream ran from a lake, through a V shaped gouge and down the slope. A large flat rock sat supported on another, giving ample shade underneath. Some smaller boulders provided natural seats.
&quot;This is fairly safe, no large predators that we can see. The snakes are poisonous, and there are scorpions, so don't go reaching into any hollows. We'll make this our base, this is where we will bring everyone.&quot;
&quot;When are we starting the rescue Danny?&quot;
&quot;Now. We'll start with the king's three companions, they are in their rooms. Rupert, we'll restore you to your normal appearance, and it will be you, me and nalini. We don't want more, there would be too many people. I'd like to pull this one off without alarming the guards, so we will do it one bedroom at a time.&quot;
&quot;Actually, we'll take prospero with us, but he can wait in the next shadow. We don't want to alarm them too much.&quot;
We set off, arriving in the disused wing of a once great manor house. This corresponded closely with the wing in which the prisoners were being held, but we needed to watch our steps since the floorboards were rotting.
We positioned ourselves, then nalini, I and rupert shifted into the bedroom. There was a young man with brown shoulder length hair, waxed moustache and wearing velvet and lace sitting on a chair by the window reading a book. He looked up as we arrived, his face showing surprise. We all put our fingers to our lips, and walked over to him.
Rupert said softly &quot;Robert, we are here to rescue you. Is there anything you must take with you?&quot;
He shook his head. &quot;Just my cloak.&quot;
&quot;Let's go then.&quot; He picked up his cloak, and we shifted back to where we had left prospero.
&quot;Where are we? How did we get here?&quot;
&quot;This is prospero, the duke of poitain. He will explain things to you. We must rescue your friends.&quot;
Nalini, rupert and I took up position at the third bedroom, where the other two were talking. I must admit my heart was racing just a little.
We walked in where two men were talking. One was sandy haired, perhaps mid twenties, while the other was dark haired and mid thirties. They stopped, surprise registering. Rupert said the same, and then we lead them back to the disused wing with with propsero and Robert. The whole process had taken about a minute.
We lead them rapidly back to the volcano crater. &quot;Prince Rupert, we will leave you here with your friends for now. We should be back in half an hour or so with the king.&quot;
One of the young men with brown hair announced &quot;If you go to rescue our king we will go with you!&quot;
I shook my head. &quot;I'm sorry, but you would be in the way. Prince Rupert can answer many of your questions. We will return.&quot; I hoped. What nalini and i hadn't told anyone else was that the creatures who were running cromwell were monitoring the trial, and would probably try to stop us. Failing that, they could easily follow us. We did not know their capabilities, they would undoubtedly try something.
Should any of us be killed, the others could walk through shadow, but if the four of us who could were somehow incapacitated, then liz, rupert and the others would be stranded.
We gathered liz and paula, and walked through shadow to a huge ball room in the inhabited wing of the mansion that corresponded with cromwell's manor and the room where the king was being tried.
&quot;Liz, you stay here with your gun. We will be bringing back the gang of seven, they may need threats to keep them in line.&quot; she nodded, took her gun out and cocked it. She looked tense.
The situation in the courtroom was that the king was manacled between two guards. Cromwell was seated by himself on the same side as the king, while the rest of the gang of seven sat at two long tables. Nalini had to remove the king's manacles, then shift out with him, minus the guards. The rest of us had to grab the gang of seven.
Nalini took up her position, and began working on removing the manacles. What she had to do was fetch them here, then shift in, grab the king and return. I positioned prospero and paula, telling them &quot;Each of you must grab two of the gang, and shift back here as soon as you grab hold of them. Then one of us, probably nalini or myself, must go back and grab cromwell.&quot;
They both nodded, looking tense. I continued &quot;We will all shift in at the same time, so get ready. Once the manacles appear here, we will shift in. The quicker it is done, the safer we will be.&quot;
A minute later there was a clatter of chains on the floor. &quot;Okay, let's go!&quot;
I could sense the shadow, and had a mind's eye impression of where things were. We would come in behind the chairs of the six, and would drag them back with us. If the chairs came with them, they would arrive sitting, otherwise they would arrive and fall over. We would be behind them, so they would be little danger to us in the first few moments.
Nalini and i were in telepathic communication, as usual. We also had a link with paula, but that was tenuous. Prospero was on his own. I was positioned at the end nearest where cromwell was, so that nalini and i had the best chance of collecting him.
We shifted in with rainbow effects. One of the puritans was speaking, raising his voice and ranting. Nalini grabbed the king, said &quot;Excuse me your majesty.&quot; and vanished, leaving a rainbow after image. I clapped my hand on the shoulders of the two in front of me, grabbed and stepped back, shifting as i did. They arrived with chairs, and I immediately ran to where cromwell was. With my shadow shifting senses at full throttle, I would be less effective at fighting in one shadow, but I was also aware of five creatures bristling at us. The energy was surging through me, and I swatted at them as one might annoying flies. They scatterd and fled.
I burst back out as cromwell was rising to his feet. Prospero was a still there, but paula was fading in rainbows. I grabbed cromwell and stepped back into a rainbow, aware that surprised guards were now beginning to react, raising pikes and moving toward us. Nalini was fading in beside prospero. Cromwell and I arrived in the ballroom, and i jumped away from him in preparation to drawing my own gun. Pandemonium was just starting as everyone we'd snatched began exclaiming. Prospero faded in, followed by nalini.
&quot;Quiet everyone!&quot; I thundered. We'd be attracting attention of the occupants with our noise. I waved my gun at the puritans. &quot;Form up in twos! Now!&quot; We would have to walk close with them to be able to shift them all, and nalini and i would have to shift in concert. &quot;Prospero and nalini, at the front please, with cromwell between you. Your majesty, please stand here. Liz, on the other side of his majesty, and paula, fall in behind.&quot;
&quot;All right, everyone start walking.&quot; nalini ordered.
We started walking across the ballroom. preparing to shift. Just then a head poked around the further door, and a voice exclaimed &quot;What the devil is going on here!!?&quot;
We faded out, leaving the querant to wonder at the chairs and the chains and our rainbow after image. We shifted into the ruined castle. This area had been burned, the roof had fallen in, leaving just the scarred walls and the rotted remains of the charred timbers. It was raining. We went back through the immense cavern, and then to the extinct volcano.
I think everyone was talking at once, expostulating, asking questions.
Nalini turned to prospero &quot;All right prospero, they're all here. You can sort out the mess.&quot;
She turned back to me. &quot;Those creatures will return soon enough. I wonder if they are a real threat?&quot;
&quot;We'll find out soon enough if they are. Otherwise, tonight we need to find out how to trash their little playground. What are we going to do with this lot?&quot;
She shook her head in exasperation. &quot;If it were just the king and his men, we could take them back and release them.&quot;
&quot;Maybe we should do that anyway? Except with the puritans in chains?&quot;
She smiled. &quot;Nice thought, but there's still the army, the civil war and the witch inquisition. That needs cromwell to dismantle it. Prospero won't settle for any less.&quot;
&quot;Nah, he won't.&quot; I glanced over to where he was talking. &quot;It's his show now. Look at him, he's in his element.&quot;
Prospero was standing on a small rock addressing everyone. He'd managed to quieten them down. The king and his men were standing in the shade of the eucalypt trees. The king was middle aged, with long brown hair permed in ringlets, and tied with small bows. Like his companions he wore lace and velvet, except that while they wore knee high riding boots, he wore silk stockings and dainty high heeled shoes such as women wear back home. The puritans stood closer to the large boulders, and all were dressed in black, with sensible low heeled shoes and tall black hats.
Prospero was talking &quot;..have all betrayed your sacred trusts! Do any of you know what that sacred trust is?&quot;
There was a lengthening silence. One of the cavaliers called out &quot;They deposed the king! Is that what you mean?&quot;
&quot;No! I am asking each one of you what your sacred trust is. If you cannot answer that, then you should not be in a position of authority.&quot; He singled out the king. &quot;You sir are the king. Can you tell me what your sacred trust is, as king?&quot;
The cavalier who'd spoken before bristled. &quot;Here! You cannot speak to his majesty like that!&quot; The king put out his hand, waving for silence.
&quot;I am the king, you are correct. But whom am I addressing?&quot;
Prospero smiled. &quot;I sir am Prospero, duke of Poitain. I am the right hand man of the King of Aquilonia, and his successor should he die without issue. We have had our civil war against a corrupt and degenerate king, and have set in place a regime that will ensure that the excesses that occurred under the old king can never be repeated. I thought our civil war was bad, but it is nothing compared with what I have seen in England. This war and the witch inquisition must stop!&quot;
There was some rumbling about foreigners meddling in England's affairs from the puritans. He looked around, then spoke &quot;Very well, first let me introduce my companions. The earl of Bendora, Lord Danny, and his wife the Princess Nalini.&quot; Cromwell looked hard at us, then started. &quot;This is my wife the lady Paula, and this is Princess Nalini's cousin the lady Elizabeth. Now, what about yourselves? Prince Rupert I know, we rescued him earlier. King Charles I know by repute, as I know Lord Protector Cromwell by repute.&quot;
The others introduced themselves. The three cavaliers were all nobles: Tobias Villiers, Earl of Maitland, late twenties, slim, with blond hair and beard, Robert Devereux, Earl of Cessnock, about twenty, also slim, with shoulder length brown hair, and moustache, and Sir James Monck, Earl of GrantChester who was in his mid thirties, tending to portly, dark curly hair, goatee and waxed moustache.
Four of the puritans were also nobles: Sir Mark Fairfax, baron of Cameron, mid thirties, scottish accent, short dark hair, clean shaven, wiry, Matthew Carfax, Earl of Essex, mid forties, stout build, dark hair gone iron gray at the temples, thinning on top, Stephen Margrave, baron of Lansford, mid thirties, short sandy hair, medium build, and Henry Shelley, baron of Dorchester, late thirties, medium build, short brown hair, balding. The other two were rich merchants of some kind: Thomas Pride, mid thirties, dark hair, solid, but still fit looking, and Simon Lambert, late twenties, slim, fair haired.
It transpired that Earl Tobias was married to Sir Mark Fairfax's sister. It occured to me that this could make for some interesting fireworks over the next few days.
&quot;Now why in god's name are we here?&quot; one of the puritans demanded.
&quot;When can we go home?&quot; another asked.
&quot;We rescued the king and his men to prevent a gross miscarriage of justice, where you so called men of god manufactured evidence so you could condemn these men to death. Does not your scripture expressly forbid such?&quot;
I interrupted with &quot;'Thou shalt not bear false witness. Thou shalt not kill.'&quot;
&quot;Thank you danny.&quot; Prospero continued. &quot;We brought the rest of you here so you could talk with one another, and settle your differences like good god fearing christians. Now, I wish to give all you gentlemen food for thought, after which we shall set off for Aquilonia. You shall be our guests for a short time, and then we will return all of you to England.&quot;
He drew himself up. &quot;Now, I shall be critical of all of you. First, the king. You, king Charles must bear first responsability for what has happened. The parliament would not have deposed you had you not been such a bad monarch. You have betrayed your sacred trust, I want you to tell all of us what your sacred trust as king is.&quot;
King Charles blinked, pursed his lips. &quot;I am the king, by right of birth. The authority of the king descends from god himself. All must obey me, my word is law. I... I am not sure what you mean by sacred trust.&quot;
Prospero looked stern. &quot;No, I did not think so. Had you known, you would not be now fleeing for your life in the midst of a civil war. Very well, I shall tell you, and you can think on my words. You are king, you are not a rack for fancy clothes and a crown, your office is not an excuse to spend the contents of the treasury on having a good time. You are not infalable, you do not have some exclusive access to Lord God Almighty to issue laws and proclamations. You are not there just to stop your nobles from killing each other. Hear me well. Your sacred trust is to all the people of England, to provide for the good order of the land, to provide that everyone has work, and food, clothing, all the necessities of life.
&quot;The nobles can provide for themselves, the common people cannot. Your sacred trust is to make just laws, to see that these laws apply to all people, that nobles, king and commoners alike are all subject to the same laws, and are treated equally before them. Your parliament is the voice of your people, to tell you what laws need changing, and what needs doing. You dispensed with that parliament, and ruled as despot. Many of the common people are starving, others are worked to death, yet you have done nothing to alleviate their suffering. You have failed to curb the greedy nobles and merchants, you have oppressed the poor with unjust taxes, and you have led the land into a civil war. I am sure these puritans could tell you more complaints.
Prospero's finger stabbed into the air. &quot;Now your majesty, please think long and hard about this. Later I will ask you why you should remain king, and how you can repair the damage you have done.&quot;
He turned now to single out the nobles standing near the king. &quot;You nobles, I will accuse you as a group. Can any of you tell me what your sacred trust is?&quot;
Prince Rupert ventured &quot;To be loyal to the king, and to ensure that his laws are carried out?&quot;
&quot;Partly right, Prince Rupert. Any others?&quot; There was a chorus of head shaking. &quot;Very well. Yes, your duty is to your king, and to ensure that his laws are carried out. You must ensure that his laws are applied equitably and equally to all. As a noble, your estates are like a small kingdom. Your sacred trust is to care for your peasants, the people who work your estates. They are your wealth, without them you would have nothing. You must ensure that they receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. They must receive enough to have decent food for all their family, they must be able to afford decent clothing, have a roof over their heads. Their daughters must be safe from ravishment. When they are ill, you must provide for them. Yet you force them to slave all day for a jug of milk, you waylay their daughters and ravish them, you forbid them to kill the hare that eats their lettuce or cabbage. You have fenced in the common areas to prevent them from grazing their cattle, as has been ancient priviledge. In all, you treat your peasants worse than you treat your cattle. You call yourselves nobles, do any of you have any concept of what nobility is? You should set examples for your people, not parade around like peacocks in lace and jewellery, idling away your time, or grinding the faces of your peasants into the dirt.&quot;
There had been a few sounds of agreement from the puritans during his speach. He rounded on them. &quot;Now then, Lord Protector Cromwell. Can you tell all of us what your sacred trust is?&quot;
Cromwell said quietly &quot;In faith, I agree with all your criticisms of the king and the nobles. I would say that as Lord Protector, my sacred trust is the same as the king's, except that I would add that my duty is to god and his law, and I must strive to keep the evil one at bay.&quot;
&quot;And would you say you have kept your sacred trust?&quot;
&quot;Yesterday I would have told you yes without hesitation. Our blessed saviour has visited me in dreams, and has instructed me in what I should to to root out evil in the land. But last night I had a troubling dream, wherein I spoke at length with your two companions. They pointed out that many of the things that have happened in the past five years have not been in accordance with our scriptures. It has caused me much soul searching, but I fear I must agree that many things have not been done in accordance with scripture. It is my considered assessment that we have not been true to our sacred trust.&quot;
&quot;At least you are honest. You assumed the king's mantel, you assumed his sacred trust. Yet you have brought the kingdom to civil war, you have instigated the witch inquisition, and caused the death of many innocent people. You have conspired with the nobles to fence in the commons, to force the peasants off the land they have tilled from generation to generation. You have caused untold misery by perverting god's holy word. Danny, to you have anything to add?&quot;
I realized prospero was floundering with the intricacies of religious fanaticism. &quot;Yes, I have a few words to add.&quot; Nalini and I walked to stand beside him. I was martialing my thoughts.
&quot;This applies not only to Cromwell, but to all you puritans here. You claim you are pious men, devoutly following god's holy word. Where in the bible does it say 'thou shalt kill christians because they be catholics or protestants'? Jesus warned us to beware the levin of the pharasees, and looking around you puritans I see pharasees every one. Self righteous hypocrites ever ready to condemn your brothers and sisters for the spec you see in their eyes, while ignoring the log in your own.
&quot;Ever ready to follow the exact letter of the law, and totally ignore the spirit. Jesus asked us to show compassion, but where is your compassion when the peasants were driven from their lands? Where was your compassion when you started the civil war? Where was your compassion when you condemned thousands to death during the fighting? Soldiers were defeated, and surrendered, but you gave orders to take no prisoners! You foul murderers! You are an abomination before god!
&quot;You whited sepulchers full of dead men's bones, where does it say in scripture 'kill your lawful king'? Jesus preached obedience to lawful authorities, as they have been ordained by god. By trying to kill your lawful king you stand guilty not only of treason, but also of blasphemy. You have set yourselves up as god and jesus christ, re-writing or reinterpreting the scripture to suit yourselves.
&quot;Render unto ceasar the things that are ceasar's, render unto god the things that are god's! Are any of you learned enough to recite your commandments?&quot; They began to recite the ten commandments. I interrupted at the appropriate point.
&quot;'Thou shalt not kill'! yet you stand guilty of insurrection, treason, would be regicide, and the murder of countless loyal subjects for no other reason than they are loyal to their king! Next comandment.&quot; I signalled for them to continue reciting, then interrupted again. They were defiant as they recited.
&quot;'Thou shalt not commit adultery'! I give you jesus's words 'Whoever even looks at a women with lust in his heart is guilty of adultery.'. Yet when I was in the kitchen today, the kitchen hands complained loudly about you puritans, how you would put your hands down their bodices, or up their skirts. That is far beyond looking at them! Shall I name names, and describe before everyone what you did? Next commandment.&quot; Their defiance was turning to looks of guilt. They weren't as forthright with their recital.
&quot;'Thou shalt not steal'! But you fenced in the commons, stole the land and the houses from the common people, kicked them out to starve, stole bread from babies, stole the kingdom from the king, even the manor you occupy near York you have stolen from a royalist! Next commandment!&quot; Not all of them recited this time.
&quot;'Thou shalt not bear false witness'! Yet you bribed people to give false evidence in the witch trials, you paid torturers to extract confessions from the accused, and tortured them until they confessed! The cries of the innocent have affronted god! He will judge all of you for that! Next commandment.&quot; Cromwell recited alone.
&quot;'Thou shalt not covet'! Yet you encouraged people to covet by rewarding them with the property of those they condemned. Not only have you broken all the commandments yourselves, you stand guilty of actively encouring others to break them! Yet you have the hide to condemn witches because they break the first commandment.
&quot;Now, you have forgotten the greatest commandments of all...&quot;
&quot;But there are only ten!&quot; came the protests.
Cromwell shook his head. &quot;This is like my dream last night. God told me there are no longer ten, because we are not subject to jewish law, but there are two.&quot;
I continued &quot;Correct! Jesus said 'I give you two commandments only. The first is love the lord your god with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind. The second is like the first: love your neighbour as yourself. From these two commandments hang the law and all the prophets!'. You ignore jesus' teachings, basing your hatred and venom on the old testament only. That is the old covenant! If that were the whole truth, there would have been no need for jesus to have come to us, and we would all be jews still, secure in the righteousness of god's law. As christians we are all under the new covenant not the old!
&quot;Jesus was the sacrificial lamb, creating the new covenant, that did away with all the jewish laws from the old testament. Consult st paul if you do not believe me. We not follow jewish law, but the law of christ. I'll let you ponder on what that is while we walk.
&quot;But I will give you 2 more things to contemplate: First - jesus taught forgiveness, not condemnation. None of us can be as perfect as jesus, BUT we must not preach, teach or behave counter to his teachings. You puritans go about condemning anyone who does not see the world through your eyes, and you go about murdering those of god's children who are different from you.
&quot;Second - love your neighbour, do good to those who hate you, forgive your enemy. Have you forgotten jesus' words? I will leave you with nicodemus' question to ponder 'lord, who is my neighbour?'&quot;
I turned to prospero &quot;Sorry prospero, I think I've alienated almost everyone.&quot;
He shrugged, smiled. &quot;I was doing a good job of that by myself. It will give them all something to think about.&quot;
The two groups had begun talking amongst themselves. Cromwell turned to me. &quot;Sir, you should consider a career in the cloth. You have god's holy fire within you. What you said echos my dream. I know in my heart that your words are true, no matter how unpalatable they may be. What happens now?&quot;
I replied &quot;I am a doer, not a preacher. We are acting now, to stop a civil war, and to stop the torture and murder of innocents.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;Now we journey to Aquilonia. Your lives are safe, we do not intend to harm you. You will be my guests for a time, and then we will return you to England. We desire that you two groups talk about your differences, and resolve them peaceably. Now, I require your solemn word as gentlemen that none of you will attempt to harm anyone else, nor will you try to flee. There are dangers, but you are safe with us.&quot;
There was some resentment, but both the king and cromwell gave their words that they would behave themselves, and then ordered their supporters to follow suit.
Nalini asked &quot;Before we set off, does anyone need to relieve themselves, or eat or drink? And I think we should fetch his majesty something more suitable for walking in.&quot;
There was more general hubub. Most of them wanted to know how far we were walking, why we were walking instead of riding, and generally trying to act self important. None of them seemed exactly happy with the situation, except perhaps the king, who had been facing execution.
&quot;Walking is good for you. The good lord gave you legs, so why not use them?&quot; I told them. It would take most of a day to reach aquilonia, but I told them simply that we would reach Aquilonia before nightfall. Let them discover that nightfall would be seven or eight hours away later.
While preparations for leaving were under way, nalini, prospero and I discussed how the journey should proceed. We did not want to alarm our prisoners too much. Somehow they seemed to have glossed over where they were and how they got there. Nalini theorized they rationalized that somehow they had been knocked unconscious and conveyed here; that was an expansion of her 'people see what they expect to see' idea.
Prospero and I thought we should give an explanation before we set off, nalini feared the puritans would condemn us as witches, and try to kill us. Then she shrugged &quot;I had a bad experience with people like that in another shadow. Maybe telling them is the right thing.&quot;
&quot;I presume that telling them we are sorcerers is not an option?&quot; prospero asked.
&quot;Um... you'd give them an excuse to burn us alive.&quot;
&quot;Oh... somehow I thought it was a word we should avoid. Shame, it would make the explanations easier.&quot;
I gathered them together. The king and his cavaliers assembled on my right, cromwell and the puritans assembled on my left. The kept a distance between the two groups.
&quot;Before we leave, there a few things we should explain to you. You are probably wondering where we are right now, why the sky is a different color, and how it is that you haven't heard of Aquilonia, but we can walk there before night fall.
&quot;Let me start by saying that there isn't just one earth, but many side by side like pages of a book.&quot;
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;Rubbish!&quot;
&quot;That's blasphemy!&quot;
&quot;Matthew isn't it? If you think it's blasphemy, you had better have a long talk with Lord God himself. Would you set limits on our god? Tobias, if it's rubbish, maybe you can explain why the sky is this color?&quot;
Matthew countered &quot;Of course it is blasphemy! There is only one earth!&quot;
&quot;Does the bible say that? If you check Genisis, it says the firmament above, and the firmament below, which has water and dry land. It does not say there is only one earth. Now if you are going to keep interrupting, I'll stop explaining. All I wanted to say was that we are on a different earth from the one you were born on, and that with god's help we can move between them while we walk. Thus you will see the sky change color a number of times on our journey.
&quot;This is also why you need to stay close to one of us, because we are permitted to travel between the different earths. You are not permitted, but if you travel with us then you are permitted provided you stay close to us. Let's form up so we can start walking.&quot;
Two more puritans, Thomas and Henry, added their voices to that of Matthew, screaming blasphemy. I rounded on them &quot;If the Lord God Almighty sees it fit to make the world in such a way, who are you to call that blasphemy? God's will can never be blasphemous. Think, all of you, not so long ago, it was blasphemous to suggest the earth was round. It was blasphemous to suggest that the earth revolves around the sun. But calling this blasphemy didn't change the fact that god had made the world like this, and it was us humans who could not understand. It is not commonsense, anymore than a round earth is commonsense, but commonsense is not God's sense!&quot;
They looked angry, but their protests subsided. The king asked &quot;How is it that you can move between these earths?&quot; He had formed his group up behind nalini and prospero. The puritans began to fall in behind his group.
&quot;We are not from your earth. We are from another one, where this ability is common to many people. Normally we stay away from your earth, because most of you are too warlike. Now, let us all start walking. From time to time the scenery will change suddenly. Do not be alarmed.&quot;
Prospero and nalini lead off with nalini and I shifting. Paula and I shooed the stragglers to keep up with everyone; prince rupert and liz walked together in front of the puritan group. They all started out two abreast, with the king and cromwell walking by themselves, but the king swiftly inserted himself between prospero and nalini, and started talking to prospero. Either that, or they fell back to flank him. We seemed to be in a line that was too long, making it difficult to shift everyone, because several times we became separated. I had the rest of them form up three abreast. Cromwell fell back to walk with paula and myself. That seemed to make the line short enough that we could shift at the same time, and keep the entire group together.
We started across the plateau, shifting every couple of minutes. No sense in rushing things, so we might as well enjoy the walk. The first shift was to a larger plateau, with a larger lake in the center. The craer was deeper, the fangs of the rim higher, and snow capped. There were gasps from almost all of our guests/prisoners.
The puritans started wondering aloud about witchcraft, and several accused us of being witches. Cromwell turned to me &quot;I ask you to explain to us how this is not witchcraft.&quot;
I responded &quot;On what evidence do you claim that? English law presumes the accused is innocent until you can prove his guilt. First tell me why you think this is witchcraft.&quot;
&quot;Because it is not natural to move like this. The very world around us changes as we walk!&quot;
&quot;Are you arguing that everything you don't understand is witchcraft? A few hundred years ago guns were considered magic, now they are called science. Could any of you set of running in the morning, and run all day? Some people can, would you call them witches? Define witchcraft for me.&quot;
Matthew turned around. &quot;Witchcraft is the use of spells, it is trafficking with the devil. How else do we travel?&quot;
&quot;I assure you, we have no truck with the devil. What we do is not spells, or some demon powers. Our powers are granted by god. If you would cry witchcraft, then you must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the demon is doing this.&quot;
There were several attempts along the -not natural- line, but they could not think of any other arguements.
&quot;Do you see horns growing from my head?&quot; To my consternation, matthew, thomas and simon all turned to look at me. &quot;Do you see a cloven hoof? Do you see me command the demon? Evidence, not false witness and hearsay! I tell you our powers come from god himself. Tell me, when the angels visited abraham and lot, how did they arrive?&quot;
&quot;Why, they flew down from heaven!&quot;
&quot;Did they? If you check genesis, you will find they appeared on the ground, and walked toward abraham. He throught they were ordinary travelers, yet two were angels, and the third was the lord god himself! They did not fly, they walked out of the rainbow, just as we do now. And when they were finished with abraham, they walked on to sodom where lot was staying.&quot;
They dragged out bibles, they quotes passages at each other, we became separated from nalini. We caught up again, and stopped so that prospero could demonstrate what he looked like shifting in and out. He walked away from us, faded into a rainbow after image. Thirty seconds later he reappeared in a rainbow shimmer. I was at pains to point out that this was how the angels appeared.
They talked amongst themselves for a time. We moved across grassy plains covered with red and yellow striped zebras, and dark horned animals, under pale blue sky. The sky shaded to green, the animals larger and more brightly colored. The sky shaded to lemon yellow, the grass changed to tall ferns and palm trees. In the distant see large animals with long necks like treetrunks grazed in the water. Closer a herd of brilliant red, yellow and green dinosaur like creatures grazed on the lush red ferns. The cavaliers and the puritans gaped open mouthed.
I remarked to cromwell &quot;Behold the wonders of god's creation. These creatures died out many years ago in your earth. But sometimes your farmers will discover their bones.&quot;
&quot;They are dragons then?&quot; simon asked.
&quot;No, what you think of as dragons are actually creatures like this. None can breathe fire, many are plant eaters, although some are meat eaters, and they are large enough to gulp downa human in one bite.&quot; We passed onto lavender skies, dull yellow grass growing on a hilltop. In the distance we could see green roofs and metal towers of power lines.
With several more shifts the powerlines were close by, and we walked the access track between huge trees with dark blue trunks and yellow and red leaves. They wanted to know what purpose the towers and wires served. I told them they harnessed the lightning, and made it available for lighting and cooking. &quot;It is not magic, it is science.&quot; I insisted.
Cromwell started a discussion about what he remembered from his dream about the new covenant and the old, about how relavent the old testament was under the new covenant. I maintained that the old testament was the old covenant, that they must be careful how they used it, because everything it said pertained to the old covenant. It was quite a lively discussion, and dragged in the cavaliers as well. Bibles were consulted and quoted. I continually hit them with the discrepancies between passages, or at least those I could still remember. They didn't often agree with me, but they stopped calling us witches. We didn't push the issue of scriptural interpretation, I lead them to the passages, then asked them to resolve the issues themselves. Many times they turned their viewpoint around and began to agree with what I said.
Of course, generally it's possible to argue many different interpretations by choosing passages. I was trying to move them away from their legalistic interpretation and toward a more compassionate reading. I won't bore you with the details though.
After almost two hours of shifting, we came to a small town amid cornfields. This was a staging center for travellers, with several large inns. We stopped at one for refreshment. By their dress, the people looked to be from the late seventeen hundreds. They spoke a dialect of german, good enough for prince rupert to make himself understood. Our party attracted attention, but our clothes weren't so odd. There was a reasonable array of european style food, everyone found something they felt like eating. We ordered jugs of water, wine and beer.
The atmosphere was a little strained, but I warned everyone one &quot;Gentlemen, you are our guests. Please conduct yourselves in a civil manner. Discussion on religion and politics is welcome, provided you are polite about it.&quot;
The king said simply &quot;I am accustomed to giving orders, not taking them. However, I have been trained to be polite.&quot;
At one point Henry, one of the puritan nobles, raised his voice about some obscure point of religion. I said to him &quot;Henry, you've lost the argument. Sit down!&quot;
He glared at me. &quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;You raised your voice. That means you cannot think of facts and reasons. You lose the argument.&quot;
Cromwell supported my stance. &quot;Henry, he's right. You must support your argument with quotes from scripture.&quot;
Oh yes, I'd also offended everyone of our guests by putting them on a first name basis. &quot;Here, we are all equals. I insist that everyone of you use the first name of people you address, no titles, no surnames.&quot; Of course firstname basis was only for close friends, and that was the attitude I wished to foster. Both the royalists and the puritans were horrified at the prospect, but we persisted, and they grudgingly acquiesced.
Our round table discussion on religious points involved the king and his men. It became a little heated, but it was apparent to me that the puritans were making progress with their religious attitudes, and that all of them had progressed to a point where they could sit around the same table and not insult each other.
We finished the meal with coffee. Prospero switched the discussion around to government, and in particular parliamentary democracy and the role of a king. It was evident that he and king charles had been discussing this issue while they walked. He discussed the issues that faced him and king amrik, and drew cromwell and the others into the discussion. It was interesting that when they weren't talking about how England should be governed, they could actually hold a reasonably enlightened discussion on the problems of absolute kings versus parliamentary democracy.
When we finished our coffee, nalini paid the bill, and we set off again. This time I took the lead, while she fell in at the rear with paula. Prospero walked behind me with the king on his right and cromwell on his left. Prince rupert and liz fell in with me, with the three cavaliers behind the king, and the six puritans in two lines behind them.
Prince rupert said to me &quot;If you had told me that I should see the king and cromwell walking and talking together, I would never have believed you. It gives me hope that there may be a peaceful resolution to our civil war.&quot;
I sighed. &quot;Rupert, part of the problem is that they are both principled and honorable men. The political process normally involves compromises by both sides. By the same token, politicians who compromise usually will not stand up for anything, they will change like the wind. If we can get these two to agree on something, there is a very good chance they will stand by that agreement.&quot;
&quot;I would almost say you were magicians, I cannot see how you and prospero have managed this.&quot;
I chuckled, wondering how to explain. &quot;It comes from a science called psychology, you have yet to invent it. It's about how people behave, and how they react to what other people do and say. Good leaders know most of this instinctively. We are having discussions about relition and politics, but we are avoiding the real situation in England right now. First, we must foster friendship between everyone here. That means we must put everyone on an equal footing, no titles, so friendship has a chance to grow...&quot;
&quot;So that is why you told us all to use first names!&quot;
&quot;Partly. The other aspect is that first name basis amongst the English is reserved only for close friends. They all know that. They keep their distance by use of titles, or last names. They may feel uncomfortable using first names, but the feelings that go with that are ones of friendship. They expect that anyone they call by first name is a friend, and they start to feel friendship.&quot;
He looked puzzled, thoughtful. &quot;This is this new science you spoke of?&quot;
&quot;Uh huh. I know in German you have sie, irh and du for you. Du is only used to children and close friends. You may feel embarrassed calling your king du, but you will feel a sense of friendship, of closeness, that the term your majesty won't let happen. If he calls you du, then you will feel he really likes you, you would not be embarrassed. It's the same principle. You'll have to think about it a bit. The other part of building friendship is doing things together, sharing the risks of the journey.&quot;
&quot;It's team building, isn't it?&quot; liz exclaimed.
&quot;Yes. And a whole lot more. Right now the king and cromwell are solving prospero's problems with parliamentary government. The end result will be something they can apply to England, but they developed it in a non threatening situation, for a different country.&quot;
They both nodded. Liz asked &quot;You've been heavy into religio for the past few hours. What's the point of that?&quot;
&quot;Part of the problem with the country is the religious fanaticism. Puritans persecute protestants. All the protestants hate the catholics, and let's not mention the jews in all of this. It's all in defence of the idea that their faith alone has a monopoly on religious truth, and if you can't agree on every point, then you are doomed, damned, and we might as well kill you now before you corrupt any one else. These people are the religious and political leaders of the country. If we can tone their fanaticism down, and inject more compassion into their religion, it should have big payoffs for everyone over the next few centuries.&quot;
I paused for a moment while we shifted onto an ashphalt road. I moved everyone over to the shoulder, and warned them to be prepared to move off if they heard any noises. We continued for several shifts along the road.
&quot;Liz, you and i have had our English civil war, and it was never as nasty as this. We have to try to make a difference, at least.&quot;
The road widened into four lanes, with some traffic. Two cars sped past, approaching on the right hand side of the road, and then a truck came up behind us. They seemed to date from the early to mid sixties. We moved off the road and let everyone watch them go past.
&quot;Horseless carriages!&quot; someone exclaimed.
&quot;Such speed!&quot; someone else exclaimed.
Rupert asked &quot;Are they steam powered, like our trains?&quot;
He and I got into a discussion about internal combustion engines. He asked enough questions that i felt he would try to build one when this war was over.
A little later we stopped to rest again. The sky was blue/green mother of pearl. We rested on a small bank under the shade of pink trees that looked like corals with small yellow feathery things that waved purposefully, but shrank back when touched. The bank was covered with pale yellow moss, over which crawled green slugs of various sizes. The moss stopped a few meters away, revealing the surface to be reddish gravel, cut through by a small stream with a distinct yellow tinge to it. I wasn't sure that the water was safe to drink. However, everyone had bottles of water we had fetched at the last rest stop.
&quot;Why are there no horses?&quot; the king asked testily. &quot;I'm tired of walking!&quot;
Prospero answered &quot;Firstly, we left our horses back at the manor that Oliver has made his base. Secondly, horses tend to spook with the changes.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;We don't want to push anyone too far, but we will have to walk to where we can purchase horses. How do you all feel? Do any of you feel you would prefer not to walk any further?&quot;
Cromwell commented &quot;I may be going gray, but I can still walk.&quot;
Prince Rupert, dressed in jeans and hiking boots, commented &quot;I can walk further. These boots are quite comfortable.&quot;
Thomas, a solidly built puritan in middle age, harumphed. &quot;'Tis fine for you young pups! I'm old, my legs are aching, I would as lief not walk much further.&quot;
Cromwell taunted &quot;You're no older than I! You're just fat.&quot;
Tobias, James and Robert, the three cavaliers, all complained that their riding boots were chafing. Nalini commented &quot;We should probably have fetched hiking boots for you all, but we gave our last pair to king charles. I have something in my pack that may help.&quot; Well, we could have fetched hiking boots even now, but that would entain performing an act that all the puritans would likely call sorcery.
The king announced in a hauty voice &quot;'Tis absurd to walk so far! I for one cannot walk much further. We must have horses! And these boots have no style to them!&quot; He was dressed in his foppish clothes, with silk stockings, but he had swapped his high heeled shoes for hiking boots and thick socks. He looked peeved.
He, cromwell and thomas were all in their mid forties, but cromwell was obviously fitter than the others.
Henry was probably about thirty. &quot;I can walk further, but these shoes are chafing.&quot;
Matthew, Stephen and Mark, the other puritans, were all in their late thirties. They looked at one another, then Matthew commented &quot;We can walk further. How much further must we travel?&quot;
Nalini brought out sticking plaster, and explained that cutting pieces and sticking them on their feet where their boots were chafing would allieviate the problem.
&quot;It is a couple of hours more.&quot; I announced. &quot;The next town we come to we will buy horses.&quot; I was thinking that on horseback we would have to take a more circuitous route, and there was a risk of some not being shifted with us.
&lt;&lt;We'll have to move in smaller shifts, and have paula and prospero act as flankers. This could be tricky I know, but we can't force these unfit old men to walk to far.&gt;&gt; nalini thought to me.
&lt;&lt;If anything, this is going to slow us down, but if they can't walk much further, there's no choice, is there?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;No. Phew, these people need lessons in bathing! Their feet stink!&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;You know the joke. Englishman are very clean, they bathe once a week on saturday, whether they need it or not. Most of them put clean underwear on sunday, and the real cleanliness freaks change their socks as well.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Yeah, they smell like that too!&gt;&gt;.
 She showed them what to do with the sticking plaster, then sat back and supervised while they applied it. Then she gave them a serve about their cleanliness habits.
Some of them were offended. Cromwell exclaimed &quot;Madam!&quot;
&quot;If your wives and friends won't tell you, someone has to.&quot; she countered. &quot;How often do you people wash yourselves? How often do you change your unnderwear and socks? You may dress like gentlemen, but you certainly don't smell like gentlemen. You smell worse than peasants! A gentleman washes himself everyday, and puts on clean underclothes and socks afterwards! I expect everyone of you to do something about this when we get to our destination. And I expect you to smell clean every day from now on! Cleanliness is next to godliness!&quot;
The tone of her voice was that of a school marm telling off naughty children. The guilty hung their heads in shame.
We set off again, following the trail beside the stream. The sky gradually lost its mother of pearl look, and shaded into pale yellow. The sun appeared, and shifted from green through yellow to blood red. The trail became downhill, the vegetation switched to stunted pines, then reddish ferns and bracken.
We came to a small stone bridge that crossed the stream in a single arc, and crossed. The track widened to become well travelled with large three toed prints and ruts of carts and carriages. Another shift and two carriages drove past, pulled by ostrich like creatures. The inhabitants had a middle eastern look to them. Our guests stopped and gaped, then commented loudly for some time.
&quot;I think we should continue shifting until we find a town with horses. The one we are coming to obviously has those large birds.&quot;
We shifted many times along the road to the town. The sky changed to a pale pink, the vegetation became green. We came upon medieval peasants pushing hand carts. We shifted again, and ahead lay a sprawling town. Once it had been a walled city, but now the houses and shops extended beyond the walls. Five mailed knights dressed in red and green rode past us, disappearing into the city.
I asked someone where we could purchase horses. He wanted money, so I offered him a silver piece. His eyes bugged out as if it was more money than he had seen in a while. Suddenly I was &quot;your lordship&quot; He gave directions, offered to lead us. I gave him the silver. We followed him and came to a market area with several horse traders among other livestock sellers.
Nalini had complained about the smell of our party, but the stench of the people we encountered in this town was almost palpable. It was the stench of those who were proud they bathed twice in their lives - when they were born, and again when they died; who proudly wore their clothing until it rotted off them, and simply put more layers over the top. Sewerage was piled in the streets, along with almost any sort of garbage; dogs and rats rooted through the litter with scant regard for humans, and mangey looking cats hunted anything smaller than they. The sickening odour was enough to make our eyes water.
Prospero turned to the rest of us. &quot;I trust most of you gentlemen are good judges of horseflesh. These fellows will undoubtedly try to hoodwink us.&quot;
If anything, the stench here was more bearable, there were less humans and more animals, and the animal smells were more bearable.
It took a while to purchase seventeen horses, with riding gear. When they realized how many we wanted, they became very obsequious. That didn't stop them trying to sell us broken down old nags fit only for the knackery on the excuse they were suitable for the ladies to ride.
Nalini drew her sword, brandished it at the traders. &quot;These ladies are warriors! Give us war horses, and make them good ones!&quot;
Each horse had to be walked around, assessed, felt, and commented on before we decided whether to buy it. Prospero and the four cavaliers did most of the evaluation, and they all had to agree before a horse would be purchased. Once it became plain that these five knew horses, the traders stopped arguing and brought out only their better horses.
The saddlemakers were a couple of streets away, but one of the horsetraders had a relative who was in the saddlemaking business, and next thing three or four hand carts arrived full of tack. The saddles were higher backed than we were accustomed to, obviously being designed to the knight in armor securely while fighting. We inspected every saddle to make sure it was well constructed, had nothing projecting underneath where it could chafe the horse, and so on. One by one we bridled and saddled our chosen horses, and then rode each one around the sale yards to ensure that it was tractable.
Cromwell commented &quot;These would be sturdy mounts for my dragoons.&quot;
Prospero responded &quot;They are strong and tireless. They might not be as swift as a lighter race horse, but with a man in armor this is the only sort of horse to ride.&quot;
The horses were big boned heavy animals capable of carrying an armored knight into battle, they would not tire with hours of riding. Being war horses, they were less skittish than most horses, otherwise a fallen soldier's helmet glint could be sufficient to cause a horse to rear and lose its rider. There were good reasons for the medieval horsemarket rather than something later.
The whole process took almost two hours. After haggling, the horses cost us a gold piece each, the tack for seventeen horses cost ten gold pieces. Those prices were probably still daylight robbery, but gold pieces are cheap if you are a sorcerer.
&quot;We've lost a lot of time here&quot; nalini observed. Our sorcerer's senses informed us that it was already late afternoon in tarantia. &quot;we won't make it by nightfall.&quot;
&quot;Yes, it feels like another hour till sunset, but we have at least three hours travel, maybe slightly more.&quot;
&quot;That's assuming we can shift easily with all these horses. There probably isn't much hope of shifting faster.&quot;
&quot;They may slow us down a lot. Can we boost our powers in any way, like we did when we had those gems?&quot;
Nalini nodded thoughtfully. &quot;It's worth a try.&quot; Then she turned to prospero and called out &quot;Prospero, how long does the twilight last this time of year?&quot;
&quot;Oh, perhaps three hours. Do you think we can arrive before it ends?&quot;
&quot;There's a chance. We may have to pick up the pace a bit. But first, we need to eat again. I don't trust the food here, we'd probably all get food poisoning.&quot; It probably wasn't such a risk for sorcerers, but for the others it would be.
It was surprising how much happier everyone was on horseback. I think almost all our guests felt beneath their station while they walked. We rode back out of town, and headed back along the road the way we had come. Prospero and paula led, while nalini and i deliberately trailed. During this time, nalini and I linked minds. Some time back, a magical being by the name of fin mak morn had given both of us a magical gift. Nalini had received a ring with a yellow stone, while I had received a dagger with a yellow stone.
We were never quite sure why he gave us these gifts, nor what use they were, but we did discover that the gems seemed to be linked to power sources, and coule be used to boost our own powers. However, after the events chronicled in &quot;The Shadow of the Serpent&quot;, the gems had become lifeless, and we had put the gifts away in a locked trunk, along with a few other things. The other option was to try to chanel more power through our torcs, but that did not seem to accomplish much these days. There seemed to be some sort of limit beyond which they would not go, and we had reached that limit some months earlier.
The amount of energy we had available determined how many shadows were available at any given moment, because with more energy we could perceive further shadows and open them. Our energy also determined who wide the net was cast around us, anyone inside that net would be dragged along with us. We normally operated within arm's length, which also happened to coincide with the extent of our auras. Anyone inside that range would travel with us when we shifted. Holding someone's hand would also help. We could cast the net wide enough to encompass our group of people, but only when they bunched a bit, and both of us shifted.
I pictured the dagger: gold hilt, bronze leaf shaped blade, small quillions pointing forward, and a round pommel set with the gem. The whole thing was almost as long as my arm, and certainly qualified as an illegal knife back home. I felt a sense of questing, a sense that something was shooting out, something capable of extending to infinite length. Then came the sense of contact, just as when we fetch anything. I willed it to me, feeling the sense of it in my hand, and then it was in my right hand.
I strapped it to my belt on the left hand side. Nalini's ring arrived at about the same time as my dagger, as I was attaching it to my belt, nalini told me &lt;&lt;It's alive danny, my ring is alive!&gt;&gt;. She didn't have to tell me, with minds linked I could sense its presence. However, whereas before there had been hundreds of threads or lines running off into shadow, connecting to power sources, now there were only a few. My gem seemed lifeless.
&lt;&lt;Never mind, one should be enough.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Do you think you could use yours to awaken mine?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Let's try.&gt;&gt;.
If we hadn't been riding, we would have had to stop at this point. Instead we let the horses follow those in front, melded our minds, and sank into nalini's gem. It has an odd sort of awareness all of its own. Present it with the first problem, that of waking mine.
Simple. A single thread activates. We follow it to discover it touches my own gem. There is a sense of something remote and slow, an intelligence that spans millions upon millions of years, slowly coming up to speed to communicate with ephemeral humans. A sense of yawning, stretching, then bing, the lights come on. There is something home. Lines of force shoot off into shadow, reconnecting with power sources. Like nalini's gem, there are only a few.
Present both gems with the second problem, that of shifting the entire troop with only one person shifting. A different line activates, one that runs off somewhere. Our torcs grow warm, and suddenly the colors around us are brighter, we are more alert. Our torcs will now channel sufficient power for one of us to shift the entire troop. There is a fleeting sense that somewhere, nalini and I are two parts of a greater whole, that somewhere back there, where the power lies, is the secret to our own powers and answers to questions we barely know to ask. Back there is the reason why we possess these gems. An echo of an echo of an echo of a phrase &quot;I have crossed the fires of hell to find you!&quot; and &quot;no power in the universe can keep us apart!&quot; Then it is gone.
&lt;&lt;We really must investigate those power sources one day.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;And find out our secrets. I wonder who we were?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;We must be soulmates, in the true sense of the word.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;You are my other half, but what have we been in past lives?&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;It's way back in the distant past. &quot;No power can keep us apart&quot; huh? What ever links us must be the source of some very strong power.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;One day, we will follow each line to it's begining.&gt;&gt;.
We leaned over to hug each other, then stretched. I felt good. It's a mysterious world out there, but we were going to explore some of those mysteries. We were going to make a difference.
&quot;Could we all ride a bit closer together please? We should start shifting, but if you are too far apart you'll be left behind.&quot;
We rode past the puritans to settle in the middle of our troop. With our sorcerous senses activated, we could now sense all the troop, we'd know if any was left behind when we shifted. It was as if instead of spreading our net around and catching all who were nearby, now we could perceive all we wished to travel with us, and take just them.
Nalini and i maintained our mental link, sifting shadows together, and taking it in turns to shift. We had to take an easier route with the horses, seeking a wider trail they would find easy under hoof.
We took a snaking course through shadow, avoiding abrupt changes of scene. That meant more shifts, so we compensated by shifting faster. Alternating the shfiting allowed us to maintain the speed of shifting, one of us recovering from the last shift while the other prepared for the next shift.
The dirt road from the medieval village meandered though many shadows, mostly dirt, but sometimes gravel. The horses were content to plod along at a walking pace.
The king asked &quot;Shouldn't we ride faster? We want to be there before sunset don't we?&quot;
Cromwell muttered &quot;I would have thought sunset would be about now. My stomach tells me it is time for my supper.&quot;
&quot;We will stop for a meal soon. Now there are some things you may find hard to accept as fact, but it may be hard to convince you they are. Firstly, our destination is in a different earth&quot; we were being very careful not to use the term -shadow- with its overtones of darkness &quot;so the time to travel there does not depend on how fast we travel in any particular one, but how fast we can shift between one and the next. Secondly, we are wandering about a little in order to find safe footing for the horses. As you know, we had one or two abrupt changes of scenery while we were walking because we were making a straight line. Thirdly, the sun rises and sets at different times in different earths. It is just after sunset back in your home, it is late afternoon at our destination, while in this one it is mid morning.&quot;
We got into a bit of a discussion about shifting. I dropped the pages of a book metaphore in favor of the strand of yarn. I asked them to imagine that each earth was a single hair in the strand of yarn. In selecting the next hair to move into, we had more than one choice. The straight route was not always the safe one, but the more we deviated from the straight one, the more shifts we had to make.
&quot;It still sounds like magic to me.&quot; matthew remarked. &quot;I don't care what you say.&quot;
&quot;Any science looks like magic to a more primitive people. Just think, your cannons and steam engines would be magic to someone from the middle ages, or arthur's time.&quot; I didn't want to start on the differences between magic, witchcraft, sorcery and satanism, I thought I'd lose them early on.
Prospero ventured into the waters &quot;I always thought that magic was things that circus performers did, you know, like making a coin disappear, and then plucking it from someone's ear.&quot;
&quot;It's all witchcraft.&quot; matthew remarked dourly.
&quot;Not really, it's just slight of hand. I even know how to do that one, you palm the coin up your sleeve, or on the other side of your fingers, and when you reach for someone's ear you bring it back again. Look, I'll show you all.&quot;
We reigned in our horses while prospero demonstrated by making a silver coin vanish, and then plucking it from cromwell's ear. The second time, he showed us how he had pushed it to the other side of his fingers, where it was not visible as he reached out. After that demonstration we set off again.
Nalini asked &quot;Maybe you can enlighten us. The magi who were at the birth of jesus were magicians in the old sense of the word. Were they the same as witches?&quot;
The puritans mistakenly equated witchcraft with satanism, and then lumped anything else in that they could not explain. They were forced to think hard about the magi, and back track a little on their definitions.
Nalini pushed things a little further. &quot;I've heard about some church fathers who conjure up not demons, but angels, and ask those angels to perform acts of kindness like stopping wars and so on. Is that also evil?&quot;
Most of the puritans took the opinion that they were in fact summoning demons who disguised themselves as angels. Then the king joined in &quot;But my illustrious ancestor queen elizabeth had a court magician, one dr. John Dee. He conversed with angels, and made quite a study of them.&quot;
Thomas stated &quot;We outlaw all such, because the demons can desguise themselves as angels of light, as it says in St. Paul's epistle. There is no easy way to know whether what you conjure is demon or angel. It is better to be safe, and have nothing to do with any of that. All we need know is what our blessed saviour taught, to believe in him, and we will be saved.&quot;
There was a chorus of -amen- from the other puritans.
&quot;I would add the most important point of all, to practice what jesus preached. Faith alone does not make you a good christian, and does not guarantee salvation.&quot; I stated.
Cromwell observed &quot;We believe that both works and faith are necessary.&quot;
Paula commented &quot;If you people had been better christians, this civil war would not have started.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Christians do not persecute. If you truly practice what jesus taught, then you would turn the other cheek, practice forgiveness, and have compassion on your fellow man and woman. You would not condemn, and you would not persecute. Those are the tools of the devil!&quot;
I had the distinct impression that the puritans would have loved to have us tarred and feathered, but they relied on us to get them home, plus we kept saying things that made them think about what they were doing in the name of their religion, and whether that was right.
Simon started &quot;We must be stern with errors, or they will lead the faithful astray. 'If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out!'&quot;
&quot;Yes, all who commit sin must be purged of their sin, lest they corrupt the whole community!&quot;
&quot;'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone'!&quot; I thundered back. &quot;have any of you considered that when jesus says 'if your eye causes you to sin' he means you and your sin, not someone else's? And when he says 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone' he means how you react to other people's sins? Be stern with your own sins, but be compassionate with everyone else's, because you are just as miserable a sinner as they are, even if their particular sin is not your own sin.&quot;
They hadn't thought of that in quite that way, and that set them off again. I didn't do much more other than act as felicitator, throwing in comments now and again to keep them going, and sometimes steering them back from some byway into which they strayed. The king and his cavaliers all joined in the discussion, which lasted almost all the way to tarantia.
Nalini and I had other things to worry about, apart from shadowshifting to tarantia. To be able to see the shadows, we have to activate our sorcerous sight. That means we see things other people do not, and that implies that people can develop the impression that you are mad, or on drugs.
There were a number of beings that were tagging along. There were five that resembled bright orange cactuses. They kept their distance, but they were following us. They looked like the ones who had been influencing cromwell, and boded trouble for us.
Closer was a single black truncated telegraph pole that floated near the head or our troop. It was a guide, observing us for whatever reason.
Two blue and orange puffballs circled us slowly. They were a different type of guide, or perhaps scout is a better term, since they are less helpfull.
Now there were also two other entities that resembled caricatures of the sun, round balls with serated edges and faces in the middle. They wavered in and out of focus as if they were mirages, or projections from somewhere else. In some way they were connected with the activation of our gems.
There were other entities that followed us for a time, and then left. Three ghostly humans followed us along a lonely road for several shifts, several times wood nymphs followed us through forests, odd looking creatures that resembled old gnarled trees, nothing like the pretty females of human legend.
We forded a shallow river, and something resembling a small wind vortex rose from the water. Nalini and i assumed it was invisible to the others, because it had that feel to it, when tobias, one of the cavaliers, pointed and exclaimed &quot;What is that?&quot;
&quot;Looks like a willy willy&quot; liz promptly replied.
Cromwell threatened it with his bible, and called on it to depart, but it ignored him, and circled around us, hissing. It was making the horses nervous, nalini switched us back to the shadow we'd just left, leaving it behind. We finished fording the river in this shadow, then shifted again, but to a different shadow.
We played it down, not wanting our puritans to become too excited. Nalini remarked &quot;It's harmless. All it can do is make noises to frighten us.&quot;
Animals began stalking us. Sometimes they were wolves, sometimes lions or tigers, and as often they were something else entirely. While it does happen that animals will stalk us, usually it is an isolated occurrence. This however was something that was continuing through the shadows into which we shifted.
&lt;&lt;It's those spikey orange beings.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Are they going through all the shadows we're likely to shift into, and organizing this?&gt;&gt;. I didn't quite believe that.
&lt;&lt;Danny, it's coordinated. They aren't really a threat yet, we're too many, and the horses are big enough to do some damage, but they're working up to an attack.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Then we should carry the attack to those orange entities.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;We will, but that will take some preparation. Let's look for shadows where they can't marshall anything to stalk us.&gt;&gt;.
We moved to a lonely beach, the sea dead calm, nothing around except low orange sand dunes and dull blue green pigface sprawling across the sand. From here we went to bright orange red sand and a yellow sea, still calm. We cut into one of the odder shadows, our horses hooves ringing loudly on the metalic ground. We appeared to be riding across a roughened copper sheet, blotched here and there with bright blue tarnish. The sky was an inverted silver bowl. Here and there were odd shaped lumps of different metalic colors, such as red or green or blue. Even the air smelled metalic.
Our companions admired the scenery, giving us hope we could travel for a time in stranger shadows. We shifted several times, and the metal gave way to a dark glassy substance. With successive shifts it lightened until it was like watery ice, deeply transparent. Faced leered at us from underneath, and voices laughed.
Our companions were alarmed. I explained &quot;Give them no heed. You have heard of marsh devils, that lead unwary travelers to their doom. These are similar. At worst they might spook the horses.&quot;
Matthew announced piously &quot;We have put on the armor of god, we take shelter under his might wings. We have nothing to fear.&quot; From there, the puritans broke into a spontaneous rendition of psalm 91.
From the crystal plane, we shifted briefly to an icy plane high above the world. To our right, tall mountains rose like fangs, spume streaking from their snowy peaks. To our left, the ranges dropped away in rank after seried rank, for as far as we could see. The wind was cold, and a blood red sun smiled from a powder blue sky.
We reigned our horses in to admire the view for a few moments, then moved on to avoid the cold. We arrived at a huge translucent bridge over an abyss so deep it was black at the bottom. There didn't appear to be anything with which to form the abyss, the black shaded through greys to brown, red, and then slowly through many shades into a pale green sky. The air smelled of roses.
From here we shifted to a golden bridge across a broad river, perhaps a mile or more wide, the bridge seeming to be unsupported except for cables dropping from an arch above us. The cables sang in the breezes like an aeolian harp. There was traffic on the bridge, and motorized boats on the river. We reigned in to admire the view, blocking the footpath on one side.
That proved to be a mistake, because a truck passing by on the far side, laden with steel ingots, suddenly swerved, travelling across the median strip directly towards us. The driver was wild eyed and staring. Nalini and I surprised ourselves, we used our combined wills to swerve the lorry back again, and apply the breaks. That done, we shifted away to a rocky plateau.
&quot;What was that about?&quot; several people asked.
We decided to go as close to the truth as we could. &quot;The devil is trying to stop us.&quot;
&quot;As we saw, god intervened to stop him!&quot; Matthew announced piously.
&quot;Will there be more attempts, do you think?&quot; cromwell asked.
&quot;Undoubtedly. We must be on our guard.&quot;
Cromwell nodded &quot;Yes, while we trust in god, we should take precautions as well.&quot;
Matthew countered &quot;But the armor of god is a sure thing! We have no need of precautions, we have our god. As you saw, he has saved us already.&quot;
&quot;Matthew&quot; I interrupted, &quot;there is a story told about a man who was caught in a flood, and was clinging to the roof of his house. A small row boat comes past, and the man in the boat asks him to get in. He refuses, saying &quot;I have faith, God will save me.&quot; The row boat continues on. Over the next few hours, three more row boats come past, and each time, he refuses to get in, saying &quot;I have faith, God will save me.&quot; Finally he slips off and drowns. He gets to the gates of heaven, and upbrades St Peter, saying &quot;I am a devout christian, why did not god save me?&quot; St Peter looks at him and sadly shakes his head. He replies &quot;My son, we sent four row boats to rescue you. What more did you want?&quot;
&quot;Ah, I see.&quot; matthew replied.
Cromwell commented &quot;I must remember that one.&quot; He turned to his fellows. &quot;The Lord God will help us, of that you may be sure, but we must play our part. We cannot expect the Almighty to do all the work!&quot;
We continued on, moving from one stoney desert to another. The orange things had vanished. I commented to nalini &lt;&lt;They can't just ambush us, they have to work quickly in what ever shadow we shift into.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I think you're right, they can't cause an earth quake or an avalanche. But they can cause humans or animals to attack us. If we stay away from modern shadows, and keep mainly to shadows with sparse populations, we sould be safe.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;Hmmm If those little buggers come back, I'm going to do something to them.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;If we can get safely to tarantia, we can enlist durathror and imladril to help.&gt;&gt;.
There was a limit to how far we could continue, and in the end we were forced to switch back toward european country side. We rode across fields, down country lanes with nothing more than some dogs that barked, and a bull that charged. But then we crested a hill to see a party of armed knights riding our way.
We shifted to a shadow without them, but a moment later, they appeared, shifting out of the rainbow. Prospero, riding in front, asked &quot;Did they just shift in?&quot;
&quot;Yes. There's trouble brewing. They are armed and dangerous.&quot; I didn't add that if they were shadow shifters, then they would have other powers as well. Prospero would know that.
I asked the guide &quot;How are they shifting to follow us?&quot;
Strange jumbled image &lt;&lt;are arranging that. The humans have no powers of their own.&gt;&gt;.
&quot;Right about now I wish I had a hunting rifle. I think I could shoot all of them before they could reach us.&quot;
Cromwell remarked &quot;One rifle? I presume you mean something like a musket? If we all had muskets, we could probably account for them all. How many are there?&quot;
&quot;Twelve, no fifteen.&quot; Prospero drew his gun, cocked it. Paula copied him. Nalini and I urged our mounts forward, drawing our own guns. We shifted us again, and sure enough, the knights arrived a few seconds later.
&quot;If they charge, we should shoot only one volley, and then shift. They have to follow, each time they appear we can pick more off. If we get to hand to hand fighting, some of us will die.&quot;
Paula turned to prince rupert, offering him her spare gun. She cocked it, and told him &quot;Two hands, like this. Site along here. Squeeze the trigger. It will fire fifteen times.&quot;
He accepted it, nodding. &quot;What is its range?&quot;
&quot;With a body shot, it will kill at over two hundred yards.&quot; I replied. &quot;It's a flat trajectory, high velocity.&quot;
Someone behind me observed &quot;They are wearing armor&quot; Each knight was wearing a white surcoat with a large red cross on it. Underneath that we could see the glint of metal, but whether plate or chain we could not tell at this distance.
Prospero chuckled &quot;These things will knock a hole in any armor I know!&quot;
The question was, did we shoot first, or wait until they approached? Shooting first would mean we could kill most of them, but it might still be possible to get out of this without killing.
The king, prospero and rupert all thought we shout start shooting the moment they came within effective range, perhaps fifty yards. Cromwell, nalini and I were of the opinion we should try to parly first. As it turned out, the knights decided for us. They were still about seventy or eighty yards off when they couched their lances and charged.
The narrow lane meant that no more than three or four could approach together. Our six horses completely blocked the road. &quot;Okay, nice and steady. Make each shot count.&quot; Nalini and i were prepared to shift all of us as soon as the knights came to withing fifteen or twenty meters. That would be cutting it fine.
My horse twitched with the first shot, but seemed to settle in after that. It was battle trained, if its rider made noises in a battle situation, then it would put up with that. Yet another reason for choosing these animals over highly strung thoroughbreds.
I squeezed off four shots only, each one aimed at a knight's chest. I think all of us took the time to aim, to do otherwise was to waste shots. By the time I'd fired my third shot it was obvious we need not worry about shifting. The riderless horses at the front slowed down as they neared us, impeding the progress of the few remaining knights. Two of the rear most knights swerved their horses, jumping them over the hedgerows and fleeing for their lives.
&quot;My god!&quot; someone exclaimed, possibly the king.
&quot;Safeties on&quot; i ordered. Liz showed rupert how to do that. Rupert kept looking from the gun in his hand to the slaughtered knights and back again, as if he could not quite believe that the weapon in his hand could cause so much loss of life. He asked something about what the safety was.
Liz replied &quot;There's a round in the firing chamber, the firing pin is still ... cocked?... and the safety stops it going off.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;If you drop the gun, or brush the trigger, it can go off. The safety locks the firing pin, but you should not rely on it. Especially if you are releasing the safety, the gun can fire. So never point it at anyone.&quot;
I looked at paula and liz, if anyone was going to have a reaction, it would be them.  Paula looked her usual self. Liz was sucking her lower lip and looking grim.
&quot;You okay liz?&quot;
She nodded. &quot;Yeah, I must be getting used to this. I still wish I didn't have to do this though.&quot;
&quot;So do we all.&quot;
Nalini echoed me, added &quot;We tried to avoid them, but they followed. They brought it on themselves.&quot; Well, the orange spikey things were to blame, but we couldn't mention that here.
&quot;Yeah, I know. I got a strong stomach.&quot;
Prince rupert turned and commented &quot;These weapons would cut your ironsides to pieces Lord Cromwell.&quot;
Cromwell was nodding thoughtfully. &quot;Fifteen shots you say?&quot;
Nalini and i rode forward to inspect the fallen knights. We had to make our way between their horses, some of the knights still had their feet trapped in their stirrups, and were dragging on the ground. There was a lot of blood.
Cromwell and the king joined us, followed by rupert, prospero, the cavaliers and the puritans, in that order.
Cromwell asked &quot;How is it that they kill an armored man so easily? If we use lead, the armor stops it. If we use iron, it will pierce the armor, but does not normally kill, although it can shatter bones.&quot;
Prospero replied &quot;Oliver, when I first saw this, I was astounded too. The more so because we do not have firearms in my country. The bullet is lead, but with a nickel jacket. It is high velocity, at least twice that of your muskets, maybe even three times. The nickel jacket means it will puncture the armor, but doing that fractures the casing. The soft lead inside flattens and tears a hole. The exit wound is the size of an orange or grapefruit. Death is rapid.&quot;
The knights themselves wore chain mail, plus iron breasplates and leg guards. Most were dead from shock and bloodloss, but a few were still in the process of dying. There was nothing we could do. Cromwell stopped us, and the puritans said a quick prayer for them.
Nalini turned to paula &quot;Paula, could you give your holster to rupert? If he is going to use a gun, he should have the holster for it.&quot;
We waited while rupert donned the holster and put the gun away. We moved on, shifting away through less inhabited lands. We kept our guns armed, mainly because we feared the next attack would have less warning.
Our guests discussed guns for a while, and I could tell that both the king and cromwell were planning on manufacturing modern guns. Cromwell and rupert asked many questions.
&quot;How is it that those pistols can be accurate enough to kill over two hundred yards? That is extreme range for a musket.&quot;
Prospero explained about rifling, and how spinning the bullet made it more accurate. I was slightly astonished at just how much he did know about guns, but on reflection I realised he was an army general, it was part of being a professional soldier.
&quot;How come they're all so interested in guns?&quot; paula asked the world at large.
&quot;It's a boy thing.&quot; liz replied. &quot;They always have to know how to kill things better.&quot;
We came to a cliff top above an ocean. The wind was cold, the spray freezing. The horses rode across coarse dark green grasses, here and there scrubby bushes grabbed a roothold. The few trees grew on an angle, testimony to the ceaseless wind. The sky was pale pink, the sun hidden behind clouds. In the distance was a light house. Along the beach were stupendous rocky spikes, once part of the cliff itself, the softer rock had worn away leaving granite dolmens standing like clenched fists. We counted twelve, as well as a large arch. Again we reigned in to admire the view.
The discussion had turned to army tactics, and the use of cavalry. Rupert and prospero supported cromwell in his contention that his ironsides were superior to anything else. I decided to but in.
&quot;Charles, Oliver, Prospero, you all stand at a crossroads. A few hundred years ago, those knights we shot were supreme on battlefields. At your current level of technology, the ironsides are supreme. At present, most of a battle is decided by the skill and bravery of your troops. Even with cavaly, much of the fighting is hand to hand. There is a limit to how much killing a man can do armed with a sword.
&quot;You have seen what high powered guns can do to men in armor. Those same guns will do the same to the ironsides. These guns are the least of modern weapons. If you go down this route, cavalry is finished. The soldier as the mainstay of the fighting is finished. Guns can be carried by almost anyone, and they can wreak havoc on cities. Where we come from, we have weapons of mass destruction. They don't just kill soldiers on the battlefield, they destroy whole cities, killing everyone.
&quot;Our ships carry guns that can fling two tons of high explosive over thirty miles. We have things called rockets that can carry a similar payload twelve thousand miles in a matter of half an hour, and they can hit their target from that distance....&quot;
Nalini added matter of factly &quot;We also have explosives called nuclear explosives. A single warhead delivered by rocket can destroy everything for a hundred miles, wiping the earth clean in a ball of fire, the way god destroyed soddam and gomorrah. And afterwards the soil and the water and the air are poison for millenia. In some of the earths, ones we avoid, they have destroyed themselves with such weapons.
&quot;Prospero's king has rejected the use of guns, and we respect him for that. Guns will eventially arrive, but probably not in his lifetime. It is too late for your people, but if you introduce modern guns, within five years every nation will have them. But remember this, weapons are the tools of satan. They encourage satanic behaviour. And I am angry we had to kill those knights!&quot;
There was silence for a time while people digested this. Prospero finally broke it with &quot;Nalini, you and danny have often told me that violence is the last resort of the incompetent.&quot; I think he was speaking as much for our guests as for us. &quot;If any one else had told me that, I would find it an offensive comment on my status as a military man. But I know that both of you you are superb warriors and military strategists, so coming from you I accept that comment and agree with it. I doubt there was any other way for us to deal with those knights. I am simply thankful that it is they who are dead rather than I.&quot; Several of the others were nodding at this, including liz.
He turned to look directly at the king and cromwell, riding on either side of him. &quot;But I would say that where war is concerned, we are the leaders, we owe it to our peoples to avoid war if it is at all possible. There are almost always diplomatic solutions if the parties are willing. Wars always cause much suffering, and most of them are caused because the protagonists have overweening pride. Civil wars are the worst kind, because they set brother against brother, and father against son.&quot;
Cromwell muttered &quot;I did not choose war. Blame the king!&quot;
The king countered &quot;You committed treason! You sought to depose...&quot;
&quot;Gentlemen! Please!&quot; prospero raised his voice. &quot;Now is not the time for that. Both of you could have done much more to avoid a civil war. Leave it at that for now. We still have some distance to ride.&quot;
We stopped for refreshment about half an hour later, in a harbor town. It was a risk, being among people who might be goaded to attack, but nalini and I had made preparations.
The town itself was walled, with armed guards dressed in leather surcoats sewn with bronze disks, and bearing pikes and swords. They let us enter the town without comment. The town itself was mainly low brick buildings, many whitewashed and with red roofs. People were swarthy, most wearing a dress like garment and sandals. There were all shaven headed, both males and females.
We could tell the females easily enough, many of their garments had the front panel partly removed, what remained acted as a support for their breasts without obscuring them.
The puritans were insensed, passing louder and louder comments. Liz remarked to paula &quot;Jeez, you'd think they'd never seen tits before.&quot;
&quot;Probably haven't. Hey prospero, do you think they have sex with the lights out?&quot;
&quot;They probably don't have sex, that's why they are becoming so excited.&quot; he chuckled.
Nalini was becoming more than irritated. &quot;I'm going to say something danny.&quot;
She rounded on the puritans, who were working each other into a lather over the bare breasts. &quot;Listen, all of you! If the sight of bare breasts offends you, then do not look! You so called pious puritans offend me! Most of you are married, yet anyone would think you had never seen a woman before.&quot; She borrowed a few thoughts from me. &quot;People are made in god's image, remember? If you find the naked human body offensive, you had better examine your attitude to god, because you are finding god's own image offensive! Everyone of you was born from a woman's body, every one of you suckled at a woman's breasts. If you find that offensive, then all I can say to you is that you find offense in god's handiwork, and you have no place in this world. Go and lock yourselves away in monk's cells, where you won't need to see things that offend you. Now all of you be quiet! If you can't behave like responsible adults, but have to behave like little children, then we will treat you like children. Is that clear?&quot;
They weren't convinced, but the tone in her voice told them they had better agree. They looked sheepish, and replied in a chorus &quot;Yes your ladyship.&quot;
We rode toward the docks area in silence. Rupert remarked &quot;This town makes me think of descriptions I have read of ancient greece or maybe rome.&quot;
&quot;Yes, it does have that mediteranean town from the time of christ feel to it, doesn't it?&quot; nalini replied.
&quot;Maybe earier.&quot; I added. &quot;I thought bare breasts was minoan or maybe...&quot; I was about to add babylonian, but thought better of it. The puritans would undoubtedly latch onto the imagery of the whore of babylon described in revalations. &quot;..phonecian?&quot; i finished lamely.
&quot;Do you mean we have gone back in time?&quot; rupert queried.
Nalini shook her head. We both chorused &quot;No.&quot; She continued &quot;Different earths are at different stages of development. Many of them are at points similar to our own history, but they are not the same. Even your home earth is at a point several hundreds of years in the past in own history. But this is not your history, any more than your earth is our history.&quot;
Seeing the puzzled looks on faces, I added &quot;You are not prince rupert from my earth, because that prince rupert died hundreds of years ago. The same applies to king charles and oliver cromwell. We had our civil war, but it took a different course. You are all different people.&quot;
Cromwell looked thoughtful, but still a little angry over nalini's rebuke. &quot;Our savior Jesus came to your earth? I do not know which i find less palatable. Were it time travel, there would be only one saviour, but then you people would have god like powers to be able to go back in time and change history, to kill rulers and make things different....&quot;
&quot;Time travel would lead to situations where you could go back in time and become your own father, or murder your father before he fathers you. It has been a topic much debated, but as far as we know, no one has ever managed to travel backwards in time.&quot; I interrupted.
Cromwell nodded. &quot;Precisely my point. But if there are many earths, then the saviour has visited more than one... can he be in two places at the same time?&quot;
&quot;He doesn't need to be.&quot; nalini observed. &quot;In our world he came almost two thousand years ago. In yours some sixteen hundred and something. Here he may not have even come yet.&quot;
Cromwell sighed. &quot;The idea of multiple earths distresses me, but I have seen enough today to prove to me that something like that must exist. Now it makes sense that they would be at different points in our history, for how else could the savior visit each one and save them? That I am different from the Oliver Cromwell of your earth I have no doubt. My soul is my own. God may have made that other cromwell similar to myself, but we are different souls. It is too much for this poor old man. I am tired and hungry. Let us eat, and be on our way.&quot;
We found a square near the docks with several open air tavernas. We picked the one our intuition (and the guide) suggested was the best. We offered a boy a silver piece to have the horses fed and watered. He looked at it goggle eyed for a moment, then called to some others. together they led the horses around the back. I appointed one of the guides to watch and not let anything happen.
The people spoke a language that reminded me of greek, a flowing polysylabic language, but without our translation spell we would have been lost. Cromwell noticed and asked &quot;They do not speak english, yet when they speak I can understand what they say. How is this?&quot;
&quot;That is part of our power.&quot; I replied. &quot;It will only work while you are with us. If you walk out and across the square, it will all be just greek, or whatever.&quot;
I shook my head. &quot;Why is the sky the color it is? Why do different earths have different colored skies? Why are there different earths? I don't know. Sorry.&quot;
There wasn't a great variety of food. Flat breads, some sort of meat roasting over hot coals, oily salads, a few things like falafels and dolmadas.
&quot;Hey, kababs!&quot; prospero exclaimed.
&quot;Could be souvlaki if they're greek.&quot; paula responded.
I don't think our english companions were as happy with this food, with its spiced meat, yoghurt and garlic, but they ate anyway. They served us jugs of wine and jugs of water, and I cautioned everyone not to drink the water unless they mixed it at least half and half with wine. The theory of germs not having been invented, we had some explaining to do.
We were sitting under awnings, with a view of the harbor, with its galleys with one and two banks of oars, the fat merchant ships with their single sails, brightly colored. Many of the ships had eyes painted on their bows. The breeze was pleasant, the air warm. We even managed to persuade the puritans to discard their coats.
We had almost finished eating when the city guard arrived in force to arrest us. There must have been a hundred soldiers, lead by an officer resplendent in burnished bronze armor and red cloak. He rode a white horse.
Nalini and I pictured the glyph for the spell we had prepared earlier. &lt;&lt;You've made a mistake. That's not them. Let's go.&gt;&gt; we thought in unison.
To our relief, the captain of the guard dismounted, peered at us, then said &quot;That's not them. Let's go.&quot; He mounted his horse and ordered the troops to move on.
Nalini announced &quot;That was a warning. They will return to kill us. Let's be on our way, and not tempt fate.&quot;
The bill had been paid as we ordered, so all we had to do was get our horses and go. We rode out through the gates, when there was a trumpet sound behind us. We shifted. The question was whether the orange spikey beings would shift the soldiers after us.
Nalini and i rode on without shifting, presenting the problem to our gems. We did not want to try killing all the soldiers. We needed another way, one that didn't involve bloodshed. The gems suggested a binding spell, and activated a line off into shadow to power it.
Nalini and i extended our senses back into the shadow we had just quit, and sought out the orange spikey beings. They were mustering a cavalry troop along with a century or two of soldiers, presumably in preparation for shifting them after us. The spell touched each one with sticky fingers, binding up their powers. It would hold them for several hours.
&quot;Will they follow us?&quot; rupert asked.
&quot;Not those soldiers, but the devil will try other things.&quot;
Nalini and I stepped up the pace of our shifting. We can manage shifts perhaps every ten seconds, but firstly we can't keep that pace up for long, and secondly shifting at such speed increases the risk of shifting into danger. It is not possible to inspect target shadows, and sift through them, instead we pick a line, and hope it doesn't kill us!
As I said, we picked up the pace, shifting alternately. We crossed a desert under a double sun, one red and one blue, we crossed steppes and tundra, we switched into night under five huge moons. Once we rode our horses along the top of a huge concrete dam, the lake stretching out to our right as far as we could see, and on our left a drop of perhaps a kilometer. I think everyone was impressed with the sheer scale of the thing.
We rode through a forest of pink trees like coral under the sea, and across black sand on the shores of a lime green sea. We avoided danger by deverting into what had looked like an ordinary shadow, but once there we could see the land around us rising up in a huge bowl shape, with the sky a small opening way above our heads. The bowl shape had vegetation and animals and everything, although how they stayed there beats me. We didn't have time to investigate.
From there we came to a more normal looking landscape, except that the light was given by flickering fire set on a boat crewed by snakes. I couldn't say how they managed to row the boat, but it seemed to be powered by oars.
We came to a lilipution forest, the trees no taller than our knees. In the distance was a small town, with people milling around. Nearby was a road with horses the size of rats ridden by people perhaps ten centimeters tall. Our arrival was causing panic. We shifted out as quickly as we could.
We rode through pine forests, and came to the bank of a swift flowing river, where the trail ran along the bank. Stinging insects flew out of the trees, but nalini and i wove a shield spell around our party, and they buzzed angrily around the outside.
On the next shift, three of the orange creatures appeared, and morphed into hideous demons, and flew at us. Someone screamed in terror.
&quot;Demons!&quot; Cromwell exclaimed. He fumbled for his bible. The pseudo demons avoided him.
Nalini and i activated the binding spell, picturing its glyph. I added some words for the benefit of our party. &quot;By the name of the most high god, adonai el hai shadai, and his son Jesus, I banish you. Depart to the nether regions, and never return!&quot;
The sticky web of the binding spell enveloped them, they screamed like stuck pigs, and vanished. I wondered what the puritans would have thought if they had appeared as jesus instead.
&quot;Were they demons?&quot; matthew asked.
Cromwell nodded &quot;They were demons all right. I must confess I did not believe you when you said demons were trying to prevent us.&quot; He turned to me &quot;What was that magic phrase you used to banish them?&quot;
&quot;It was no magic phrase, but the hebrew of the old testament. Adonai means lord, el means god, and hai shadai means almighty living. Your king james bible renders it as almighty living god, and sometimes as lord god almighty.&quot;
He pursed his lips, looking grim. &quot;Either you be in league with them, or you have god on your side...&quot;
&quot;How can you think we are in league with such as they! By bringing you to tarantia we would thwart their plans to ruin England. Of course they wish to stop us.&quot;
He nodded thoughtfully. &quot;You have said much today for me to think on. I will test it against my bible. How much further do we travel?&quot;
&quot;Perhaps another half an hour. We might be safe for the rest of the journey.&quot;
We continued. The sun was setting, birds setting up the evening chorus as they settled down to roost for the night. Nalini and I were becoming quite tired by now, but we did not want to stop until we reached tarantia. There we could gain help from the viharani - durathror and imladril at least - to deal with these orange beings that were molesting us.
Thirty five minutes we road into the castle grounds, arriving not five meters from the main gates. It was late evening, the twilight fading. Cromwell had a sour grin on his face. &quot;The gates are shut. Now let us see if you can gain us admittance.&quot; I think he did not believe we were who we claimed to be.
Prospero banged on the gate and called &quot;Ho, wake up in there! This is duke prospero, I wish admittance!&quot;
A small door opened, the gate keeper spoke with prospero for a few moments and then the main gate was opened. We rode slowly in, and up the hill toward the palace. It was dark by the time we reached the palace, but a guard of honor turned out to greet us.
Grooms took our horses, lackies took our bags, and we walked into the palace. The seneshal himself was there to greet us, a rotund little man in his fifties, dressed richly, and slightly inebriated. He was happy to see those of us he recognized. He turned to prospero &quot;My lord, had you sent word ahead, we could have had rooms ready. As it is, it will be perhaps half an hour.&quot;
&quot;They must be good rooms, preferably close to my own suites. Danny and nalini will of course stay with me, as will the lady elizabeth. Now, let me perform the introductions. Everyone, this is our seneshal, earl amalrik. Here we have his royal highness king charles of england, this gentleman here is his cousin, prince rupert of the rhine. Here we have earl Tobias, earl James and earl Robert, they are the king's advisors. They should have rooms close to the king. This is the Lord Protector of England, Oliver Cromwell, and these are his advisors earl Matthew, baron Stephen, baron Mark who is also a knight, baron Henry, and squire Thomas and last but not least squire Simon. We have had some trouble along the way, so everyone will need suitable changes of clothing, and servants of course.&quot;
The seneshal replied &quot;Rooms are scarce with the wedding, could we put the king and his party in your wing? Now let me think.&quot; He counted swiftly. &quot;We are preparing rooms for the delegation from shendistan, but they will not arrive until tomorrow. They are aired, and almost ready for use. They are on the second floor of the autumn wing, the one adjoining yours. Would they be suitable for Lord Cromwell and his party? Otherwise there is nothing except for the third floor in your wing, but they are small, not suitable. The delegation from shendistan will have to take lodgings in the north wing.&quot;
Some more discussion, and everything was organized. The seneshal continued &quot;The king is at a banquet with many guests, but he did ask that your party join him if they wished. Otherwise, he would speak with you tonight when you are free.&quot;
&quot;We should attend the banquet. But first we must get out of these travel stained clothes and freshen up. Your highness, would you be presented to our king tonight?&quot;
King charles stifled a yawn. &quot;I would rest soon, it has been a long and eventful day. However, politeness suggests we should meet with your king tonight. And perhaps some food would revitalize me. But first I would appreciate a hot bath and some clean clothes.&quot;
The seneshal gave orders, and his subordinates ran. &quot;Let me conduct you to your rooms, my lords, your highness.&quot;
Prospero said &quot;Tonight I am afraid you will have to borrow clothes from the palace wardrobe, but on the morrow we will arrange tailors to create suitable garb. In fact, &quot; he turned to the seneshal &quot;can we have tailors take the gentlemen's measurements tonight? That way they can start on something fashionable tomorrow.&quot;
Prospero's suite of apartments occupied the entire second floor of the east wing of the palace. Servant's quarters took up half the floor below. A coridor ran along the northern face of the east wing, and gave access to the autumn wing, where cromwell and his group would be lodged.
As we walked through the corridors, nalini thought to me &lt;&lt;Translation spells. Cromwell and the others will be isolated if we don't set them up now!&gt;&gt;.
With the aid of energy stolen from the gems we carried, we managed to set up translation spells for each of them. We only managed to complete it by insisting that we would walk with cromwell to see where they would be quartered, and telling prospero he should see to the king and his other guests. They were given two four bedroom apartment complexes that faced each other across the corridor. Servants were already there ensuring that they had hot water for washing, placing baskets of fruit and so on in each room. The rooms were opulant, and would probably offend the puritans, but I was past caring what they thought.
Two valets arrived with hand carts laden with clothing. Cromwell complained about the bright colors, and sent them in search of plain black clothing.
I spoke to him. &quot;Well Oliver, here you all are at the palace. I can appreciate that you would prefer to be home, but that will happen in a few days or so. Until then, please make yourself at home, if you need anything, call one of the servants. But please do remind your colleagues that you are currently guests of a foreign king, so please be polite to people. Other than that, the king would probably appreciate if you would appear at the banquet some time this evening.&quot;
He sniffed. &quot;You are right, I would prefer to be home. I have no choice but to trust you to bring us home. Hopefully England will not have gone to ruin in our absence. Kings are notoriously fickle, I know how to curb my tongue in their presence.&quot; Then he sighed. &quot;You have told me what you hope to achieve by kidnapping us. They are noble aims, I do not condemn you for them. I do however condemn our kidnapping, opulant as these rooms are, they are still a prison because we are not free to go home.&quot;
&quot;But you are free, Oliver.&quot; nalini responded. &quot;It's just that we are here for the king's wedding which takes place in a few days. You have seen how long it takes to travel here, it is not practical for you to leave until after the wedding. But we are hoping that you might learn a better way to govern England, one that involves less bloodshed and suffering. We will see you later.&quot;
We returned to prospero's suites. The front part consisted of a large reception area with four guest suites running off it. The fifth door lead through to the family's private rooms. Propero and paula were waiting for us in the reception area, and offered us coffee when we entered.
&quot;Are they happy?&quot; he asked me.
I shrugged. &quot;Cromwell stated he admires your aims, but he condemns your methods. He used the word kidnap. Other than that I think he will negotiate, but if you keep him here too long he will lose patience.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;I'm not sure how he will react when he finds out you are not christians. He might become fanatical.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;I will try my best, that is all I asked. I plan to start talks tomorrow sometime, but I will intersprce them with tours around the capital, there will be at least one formal audience with the king, I will also have some official duties to attend to as well. I fear we will be very busy over the next week.&quot;
&quot;He did promise to attend the banquet later. When we left he was telling the valets to fetch plain clothing in black. Where is everyone else?&quot;
Prospero indicated doors. &quot;King charles is in that suite, being bathed. There is also a valet with a selection of my father's clothes. It turns out that king charles is the same build as duke leto, so I have had the best of his clothes selected for use by the king. Tobias is in that suite there, James in that one, and robert there.&quot; He sighed. &quot;As you can see, there are only four guest suites, although the king's has two bedrooms and its own large sitting area. The other three have only one bedroom, and a smaller sitting area. I did not think it appropriate to put prince rupert in the same suite as the king, by rights he should have his own suite. So, I have given him my deceased brother's suite, which is inside my private rooms. Paula and I have my suite. My parents' suite has two bedrooms, so I have assigned you two my father's room, and Liz my mother's. They both have ensuite bathrooms. While there are other bedrooms, they are not ready. I hope you don't mind, you will have as much privacy as back home.&quot;
&quot;Thank you prospero. Where are your relatives?&quot;
&quot;Oh, they don't stay at the palace, except in very rare situations, we have a large mansion on the hill, a level below the palace. They always stay there. Since Amrik usually wants to talk with me when I am here, I always stay in these rooms. The guest rooms are always maintained ready for guests so we always have some rooms in the palace ready for immediate occupancy. No one in Aquilonia would complain at lodging with duke prospero at the palace, it is seen as quite a high honor, something king charles has been made aware of. That is why my guest rooms were vacant - they assumed I would be bringing guests of my own to fill them. Since I have been staying with you people, I have had my parent's rooms maintained in readiness as well. You never know when we might just arrive out of shadow, and need somewhere to sleep. I know you do the same with your own house.&quot;
&quot;Except we don't have the space you have. Why does your parents' suite have two rooms?&quot;
I realized the answer as he started explaining. &quot;Because most marriages amongst nobles have traditionally been for dynastic reasons. Husbands and wives always have completely separate bedrooms. My parents had only a sitting room between their bedrooms; it is not unknown for couples to have their bedrooms in separate wings of the house, or even separate houses!
&quot;Now, shall we bathe and attend the banquet? Charles and rupert will attend, we will wait for them here.&quot; He led us through the door into the family's rooms. &quot;There are clothes for you in your rooms, I took the liverty of having some made in your sizes.&quot;
&quot;That was very thoughtful of you prospero, thank you.&quot;
Shadow shifting takes a lot out of you, especially in this situation where we had taken energy from the gems in addition to what our torcs channeled. That energy channeling is like using a strong stimulant drug, you have to pay something back afterwards. You can keep that at bay for a time by eating frequently and by drawing more energy, but at some stage you hit the wall, your sorcerous senses shut down completely, and your body collapses. We weren't near that, but we both needed lots of rest. Our preferred plans for the evening were a good meal, a quiet soak in a hot tub, and then sleep, in that order.
We went into the suite of rooms we would be sharing with liz, called out to let her know we were there, and then went on into our bedroom. The suite was huge. There was a large sitting room we shared with liz, a large window at the back, and a door on either side. The left was liz's room, the right was ours. The bedroom inside was considerably larger than most people's living rooms, big enough to hold a party. The bed was hidden away on the far side of the room, near the window. Near us was an opening into the dressing area larger than our bedroom back home. There was a small selection of clothing on shelves and hangers, mine and nalini's, made in the current fashions of Aquilonia. While we rated servants, there were none here because we preferred it that way.
Liz called out &quot;Are you guys decent?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, come on in.&quot; We were down to our underwear, but as far as we were concerned, we were decent.
Liz walked in, barefoot, but wearing jeans and t-shirt. &quot;Oh, sorry, you should've said.&quot;
&quot;We're decent, but we haven't bathed yet, so we might smell a bit.&quot;
She shrugged. &quot;I haven't either yet, I was lying down.&quot; She looked around. &quot;Your rooms are the mirror image of mine. They're huge! The bathroom'll be over there. Hey, you got clothes too! He said he'd had some made in my size. Dunno how he knows my size, but they fit.&quot;
&quot;He probably asked paula to find out.&quot; nalini commented. Liz nodded. We wandered into the bathroom. Pride of place was a large sunken bath, a bit like a spa bath, only deeper. If was two thirds full of hot water. I knelt down, worked the valve that opened the tap, and let more water run in. The castle runs to plumbing and hot water.
&quot;We like to soak properly.&quot; I commented, watching the water run in and testing the temperature.
&quot;Jeez, it's almost big enough to swim in!&quot;
We both chuckled. &quot;Prospero's people are like the romans, they like their baths, they're much cleaner than a lot of people I know back home.&quot;
&quot;By the way&quot; i added &quot;with these baths, you're supposed to wash yourself first with a bucket&quot; i indicated two wooden buckets in the corner &quot;and you don't get into the water until you're completely clean.&quot;
She nodded. &quot;That's japanese style isn't it? I've read about it somewhere. Look, I'm keeping you guys, i'd better go and start my bath. Are you going to the banquet after?&quot;
&quot;Yes, though we'd prefer to sleep. But we're going to have a long hot soak first.&quot; The water running out was cooling, now little more than luke warm, so I shut off the tap. Liz left. Nalini went into the toilet, accessed through a door in the bathroom. I needed to use the toilet too, so I had to wait.
Next moment, the door on the other side of the bathroom opened, and liz walked in wearing nothing but a pair of white panties. &quot;Jeez! Do we have to share the bathroom?&quot; She ducked back.
Nalini came out of the toilet. &quot;Let me deal with this&quot; She washed her hands and put her underwear back on again. I went into the toilet.
I eavesdropped on part of her conversation with liz. &lt;&quot;Communal bathing is all the go here, japanese style. This suite really is for the use of prospero's parents, so it makes sense for there to be a single common bathroom.&quot;&gt;... &lt;&quot;No, of course you have to have a proper soak....&quot;&gt;...&lt;&quot;Of course we don't mind. It's a question of whether you will be embarrassed.&quot;&gt;...&lt;&quot;Well, you have to scrub up in the bathroom, and if you wait for us to finish, the water will be going cold...&quot;&gt;.
Next moment nalini reappeared, leading a sheepish liz. &quot;At least we outnumber danny. The first time we came to Tarantia, after rescuing paula and prospero, paula and I had to share a bath with prospero, danny, amrik and all his generals!&quot;
&quot;Jeez! That'd be a bit hard to take.&quot;
&quot;Huh! Paula paraded around, she liked the stares she received!&quot;
&quot;Mixed bathhouses are the norm here.&quot; I added. &quot;They have large public bath houses as well. You can give one of those a try if you prefer.&quot; I scooped up a bucket of water for her.
&quot;Nah, I think I'll leave that for now.&quot; She accepted the bucket, then turned her back.
I turned my back and moved away. &quot;Don't worry liz, i won't look until you're in the bath.&quot;
It is a lot easier to bathe if there is more than one person, because they can sluice water over you more easily than you can yourself. Liz got over her embarrassment rapidly enough, and joined in the sluicing. &quot;You realize they have servants here to do this for you?&quot; nalini asked liz.
&quot;Jeez, dunno if I'd like having  strangers do this.&quot; She was squatting washing her hair while I poured water over her head.
&quot;Different cultures. We've noticed we've changed a bit ourselves.&quot;
We settled into the tub for a soak. &quot;That wasn't so bad, was it?&quot; i asked.
&quot;Nah, it's more the thought of squatting there washing my bits with people watching.&quot;
We both chuckled. &quot;But we're squatting there washing our own bits!&quot;
&quot;Well, you'll be happy to know I didn't feel like you were perving on me...&quot;
&quot;Hey, he has me for that!&quot; nalini interrupted.
I chuckled &quot;That's why married men are so popular with single women. They can treat a girl like a person and not just a sex object.&quot;
&quot;Could be. Do you know, I haven't shared a bath since I was a little kid.&quot;
&quot;It's more fun when you do.&quot; nalini commented. &quot;But it's too hot to get up to anything anyway.&quot;
&quot;I wonder what our puritan friends would make of this?&quot; i asked.
&quot;Jeez, probably have a heart attack!&quot;
&quot;Hey, liz, do you think prince rupert likes you?&quot;
&quot;Dunno, he probably just finds me exotic, he hasn't seen any black chicks before.&quot;
&quot;Do you like him?&quot;
&quot;Ahh... he's okay. I wouldn't want to get serious with him though. I don't like his shadow.&quot;
We soaked for a while, talking idly, then got out and threw buckets of cold water over each other. Liz squealed with the shock, and I wondered if the others could hear us.
Later as we were dressing, nalini commented &quot;Liz likes you, but there is nothing sexual there, unlike paula.&quot;
&quot;I've noticed, it's a relief.&quot;
It was nalini's turn to chuckle. &quot;Poor danny! Two girls isn't really your dream, is it?&quot;
&quot;Nah, sweatheart, you're everything I want.&quot;
&quot;I know lover, you're everything I want. I'm just glad liz doesn't see herself as competition, the way paula always did.&quot;
&quot;She still does, but in a different way these days.&quot;
Nalini snorted &quot;Yeah, now she's pregnant, she gets that smug look sometimes when there's just the three of us. It's as if she's saying 'look, danny's given me something he hasn't given you.'&quot; She sighed. &quot;Well, what's done is done, and can't be undone. I'm just glad liz can be friends with both of us without any sexual undertones.&quot;
&quot;I think she needs people around. I've a feeling she'll be in here soon.&quot;
Nalini looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded. &quot;Hmmm, you're right, she does like having people around. I guess she's used to having a house full of relatives.&quot;
Sure enough, a few minutes later, liz called out &quot;Hey, can you give me a hand with this dress nalini? I can't get it done up.&quot;
&quot;That's why we're supposed to have servants.&quot; nalini called back. &quot;Bring your clothes in here.&quot;
Liz padded in barefoot, holding her dress against her breasts. &quot;It's got hooks and eyes all down the back.&quot;
&quot;Danny's good at them.&quot;
I'd just finished doing up the hooks and eyes on nalini's dress. &quot;Okay, turn around liz. You realize you'll need someone to help you undress as well?&quot;
&quot;Well, I'll leave when you guys do.&quot;
A little later, the three of us joined prospero, paula and rupert in the sitting area, where they were drinking coffee. Prospero quipped &quot;Ah, a thorn between two roses. Both of you look beautiful!&quot; He actually managed to sound like he believed it.
Prospero was wearing his house colors, bright red trousers with gold stripe, yellow shirt with black cummerbund, and a jacket that combined all three colors, along with much gold braid. My own outfit was dark blue trousers with a gold stripe down the leg, pale blue shirt and sky blue jacket, with gold braid. Rupert wore dark blue trousers like mine, but with a maroon jacket. Nalini wore a long dress with puff sleeves, colored mainly black and emerald green, but with the colors entwined by some trick of the weaving. She also wore an emarald green bolero jacket with gold braid. Liz was dressed similarly, but hers was red and yellow. Paula wore a variation on liz's dress, but hers was red, yellow and black, prospero's house colors. All three girls wore earings, paula had replaced her nose stud, I wore my diamond stud. Prospero, rupert and I wore swords.
Liz took one look at prospero and liz, and commented &quot;Hey, you're both wearing aboriginal colors! I should have the same.&quot;
Prospero explained &quot;They are my house colors, I'm afraid you cannot wear them here unless you are a relative, or betrothed. I hope you don't mind.&quot;
Paula smiled archly and asked &quot;Enjoy your bath did you?&quot;
&quot;Yes, it was an enjoyable experience for all of us. Prospero, you should have warned us there was only one bathroom in the suite.&quot; I was smiling.
Liz giggled.
Nalini added &quot;You heard us did you? Maybe you should have joined us?&quot;
Prospero pretented to miss the point, and replied &quot;There probably isn't room for five. Some how I feel that our english companions do not go in for bathing much.&quot;
&quot;They certainly don't go in for communal baths, let alone bathing in mixed company. That doesn't mean you couldn't persuade your guests to participate. The puritans would be a different matter though.&quot;
Rupert was lookind decidedly non-plussed. Prospero explained, adding &quot;We presumed that you might be embarrassed, so we spared you that.&quot;
Prince rupert nodded. &quot;I thank you for that. I have never bathed with a lady before.&quot;
Prospero nodded in return. &quot;Different cultures. That is where the puritans err, they assume that their culture is the only one.&quot;
&quot;Mayhap that is why their philosophy is not so popular on the continent. We have at least seven different cultures and languages. In fact, I have heard that further north, in Sweden or maybe Norway, they build separate bath houses, where they use hot stones to create steam. The whole village will sit in there naked, and then when they become too hot, they run outside and roll naked in the snow!&quot;
&quot;I have heard that too. Certainly where danny and nalini come from, there are countries with similar practices.&quot;
&quot;Whereas it surprises me to see that you have a separate room for bathing, and not only that, but that you have many of them.&quot;
&quot;Our own mansion has only a couple of private bathrooms, and a large communal one. However, when the castle was remodelled, this was supposed to be a number of separate suites for visiting dignitaries. My father was given several of the suites for his use, and then after the civil war, I appropriated the entire wing. King amrik stayed here until we had demolished the old king's chambers and built him his own chambers. Now I keep all these apartments, and it allows us to honor a visiting dignitary by accommodating him not just at the palace, but with duke prospero's private apartments.&quot;
&quot;I caught some of your explanation to the king. You are in fact next in line to the throne?&quot;
&quot;Yes. There are five of us who can trace our lineage to the old king's grandfather, my father was a grandson of that king. Old king sorono killed anyone who was closer, including all his own children, and those of his brothers and sisters. After the civil war deposed him, we faced more civil war while the claimants settled who should be king. As you can imagine, almost every noble has some claim, and many were pushing their own claim, no matter how tenuous. I settled it by putting general amrik on the throne. The whole tale is a long one, I will tell you some other time, but amrik had the support of most of the army, plus my support, and many of the nobles supported me. The other nobles agreedto support him rather than have some rival on the throne. He has proved to be the best king we have ever had. I am the official heir, since the king has no issue. He marries this week...&quot;
At this point, a servant entered and coughed discreetly. When prospero looked up, he announced &quot;Sir, your guests are assembling in the reception area. Shall I send someone to enquire after the other party?&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;Yes, do that. Have you served refreshments?&quot;
&quot;Of course sir. Will you be joining them now?&quot;
Prospero smiled quickly. &quot;I have to play host. Shall we go?&quot;
Rupert offered his arm to liz. She accepted, and accompanied him. The servant placed our coffees onto a tray, and followed us into prospero's reception area. All four of the king's party were there, some drinking coffee, some wine.
The cavaliers were all dressed the same in light red trousers and long black jackets decorated with much gold braid. The king wore darker red trousers, a white shirt, and a dark blue jacket with red and gold piping. His hair looked freshly permed, and his curls were tied with clean ribbons. All four wore swords.
Prospero greeted them with a courier's grace, drew them all into a polite conversation. I gathered that king charles had made a fuss about the color of the clothing being offered him, and the servants had had to chase around the palace looking to borrow clothing of different color. The blue jacket was one of mine, as it turned out, with a quick tailoring job done to make it fit better.
After about ten minutes, the servant reappeared to inform prospero that the puritans were on their way. Prospero looked appologetically at the king &quot;I hope you don't mind, but protocol demands that we all enter together. Once the introductions have been made, you need not sit with them.&quot;
The king smiled sourly. &quot;This afternoon, they sat as my prosecutor, judge, and jury, determined to behead me for treason and witchcraft. I have been unable to defeat them in war, but if a few hours of politeness will help me regain my kingdom, then I will endure it.&quot;
The puritans were all there, and all of them dressed in plain black trousers, white shirts, and dark gray jackets. None of them wore swords. They appeared to be in a reasonable mood.
Prospero greeted them, then asked &quot;I trust your rooms are comfortable, the clothes to your liking? Did the servants not provide you with swords?&quot;
Cromwell replied for all of them. &quot;The rooms are far more opulant than we need or want. But let that be. The clothes are plain, as befits a puritan. We wear no swords, we are men of god, his word is our armor, our bible is our sword.&quot;
Prospero lead the way back to the palace banquet hall, walking beside the king. Rupert fell in beside liz, offering her his arm. Paula walked beside me, remarking &quot;I hope one of those puritans doesn't offer me his arm.&quot;
&quot;You should take prospero's arm.&quot; I replied. I offered her my other arm.
 The banquet hall was huge. It was lit by a number of chandeliers, which threw a soft light over the proceedings. The walls were decorated in red and blue drapes with little gold motifs. There were a number of tables arranged around the room, with the center clear for dancing. It wasn't crowded, and could easily have accomodated twice the number of people. Access to the kitchens was from one wall. The main table was set by itself, a second table near by was empty. We were being led to this table.
Amrik and enyil were seated side by side at the main table, the king wearing a simple military dress uniform consisting of dark red trousers and blue jacket with little braid. Enyil wore a dress similar in style to that worn by nalini, except that hers was a tartan pattern that included black, green and yellow. Amrik stood, and wrapped prospero in a bear hug, before moving on to paula, nalini and myself. Enyil followed him, hugged each of us as well. Paula introduced liz, who also received a hug, before the king had a chance to speak with prospero.
&quot;These others are your guests then?&quot;
&quot;Yes sire, we walked into a civil war, which we are now trying to stop. I must speak with you afterwards.&quot;
Amrik shook his head and grinned &quot;We have trouble enough here prospero! We will talk as soon as we can leave this. Now, introduce us.&quot;
Amrik took king charles' hands to greet him, then prince rupert's. The others were treated to a nod of acknowledgement.
While he spoke with the group, enyil turned to nalini and i. &quot;You two look as if you have been shifting hard for too long.&quot;
We nodded. &quot;We'll have to tell you the details later, but we ran into problems with some entities.&quot; We described them.
She looked concerned. &quot;This is serious. Durathror and ra'anor are here, I will ask them to meet with us afterwards.&quot;
&quot;Also, the guys in black are religious nuts who comdemn all sorcery as demon worship.&quot;
&quot;So prospero's messanger told us. We have been briefed, but only sketchy details.&quot; She sucked her lower lip thoughtfully. &quot;I cannot ask you to sit with us yet. We will talk after.&quot;
We went to the large table set somewhere near the king's. King charles and his men sat at the end closest to the king, the puritans were given the other end, we sat in the middle. Nalini and I were closest to the puritans, but we avoided talking much by eating heaps.
Cromwell was interested in how the government worked here, so we wound up giving a short talk on parliamentary government. Prospero helped out with details.
Eventually Amrik commenced the dancing, partnering enyil around the floor. Prospero and paula got up, followed by Nalini and i, then rupert and liz. We danced one dance, then amrik collected us with his eye, and we left to follow him. Liz and rupert followed us.
Amrik led the way to his chambers, where servants set out coffee, liqueurs, wine and nibbles including nuts, fruits and chocolates. There were a number of comfortable chairs, small tables and the like, indicating he often entertained guests here. The walls were decorated with hanging tapestries, one a hunting scene, one a pastoral scene. Pride of place was given to a set of framed photographs, the main one being earthrise over the lunar landscape. Smaller ones included the martian deserts, and Saturn, Jupiter and Uranus seen from their largest moons.
Rupert looked around, then asked &quot;Should I be here?&quot;
Amrik sat himself in a comfortable chair, unfastened his shirt, and offered one foot for a servant to remove his boots. &quot;Aye lad, we want to hear your story without showing favoritism to either the king or his adversary. Make yourselves comfortable, I appologize for the lateness of the hour, but I always seem to be busy these days. You have not seen those pictures before?&quot;
Prince rupert was looking at the photographs. &quot;What are they? They remind me somewhat of moonrise, but never have I seen such fanciful images.&quot;
Amrik explained what they were of, and that nalini and I had given them to him. Rupert was at first incredulous, but then he looked thoughtful. &quot;We know the earth is a ball, and copernicus and galileo have said it revolves around the sun, as do the other planets. It therefor follows that the moon and other planets are also balls. But the size of them! They must be as large as our earth. And that means they must be much further away than any of us imagined.&quot;
Amrik responded &quot;You had best ask danny, nalini, paula or even prospero, since he visits their world. They can explain things better than I. But they remind me that no matter how big we think this earth is, it is but a small fragile ball when viewed from the moon. I had never thought about it before I saw that picture, although our scientists agree with yours. But do you know what is the most sobering thought for me? That each star we see in the night sky is another sun, with its own planets, like our sun. There must be thousands of them!&quot;
Rupert shook his head in wonder. &quot;This is too novel a thought for me to comprehend properly. We always thought they were holes in the firmament, through which god's glory shone. Though I have wondered about them.&quot;
&quot;I have too.&quot;
A servant admitted ra'anor and durathror. Introductions were performed, coffee and liqueurs poured. The king returned to the business at hand.
&quot;Tomorrow I will meet separately with your king, and .. what's his name?&quot; he looked to prospero.
&quot;Cromwell my lord king.&quot;
&quot;Yes, tomorrow I will make time to meet separately with both the king and with cromwell. After that, we can provide facilities and accomodation, they will be invited to join in any entertainments we are putting on, but that is about as far as I intend to become involved. They are welcome to stay as long as they like, within reason of course. Now, if you would be so kind as to tell us yor story?&quot;
Rupert started &quot;I do not know all the details, especially those that happened more than a few years ago. I have only lived in england for three and a half years. I will try to be truthful. We have a king, and a parliament. The king cannot pass laws without the approval of parliament. It must have been sixteen years ago that king charles dismissed parliament, and ruled for eleven years without it. He made new laws, raised taxes and so on. Cromwell was just a member of parliament, but he was an organizer of resistance to the king's despotic rule. The judges supported him because whenever there was a court case concerning any of the king's new laws, they would throw out the case declaring the king's law invalid.
&quot;Then about six years ago the king ran out of money, and recalled parliament. When parliament refused to grant him money, and pass his laws, he sent his troops to arrest them. Cromwell and two others had arranged their own army to defend parliament, and so the civil war started. The king's army was defeated, and he was rapidly pushed north, where there are more royalists. The south was for parliament, the north for the king.
&quot;By this time Cromwell was leader of the puritan faction in parliament, and managed to have himself elected parliamentary leader. I think many of the nobles thought that what they were doing was very close to treason, and they were happy for cromwell to take any blame. Parliament then passed a law declaring the king deposed, and an outlaw with a price on his head. An outlaw may be killed on sight, and any who help him may also be declared outlaw. Parliament then passed a law declaring the throne forfeit, and all the royal properties were confiscated. They created the post of Lord Protector, and chose Cromwell to fill it.
&quot;At some stage, the puritans fell out with many of the other parliamentarians, and dismissed most of parliament. The remainder are called the rump parliament, all loyal to cromwell. The leaders including cromwell are called the gang of seven. About four years ago they started the witch inquisition, where the property of any condemned witch was awarded to his or her accusers....&quot;
&quot;That would bring accusers out of the walls!&quot; amrik replied.
&quot;It did, there were a rash of accusations, and the inquisition interrogates accused witches until they confess. Once they confess they are hanged. That has turned into the Terror, where anyone who does not support cromwell is condemned as a witch....&quot;
&quot;There's many a ruler who has done that. His popularity must be falling.&quot;
&quot;It is. The civil war continued, with the king's forced defeated at every turn. I sailed over from germany, I have the honor of being the only commander to have beaten cromwell's troops. Unfortunately we only won a few battles, and then cromwell's superior numbers told....&quot;
&quot;And his battle tactics.&quot; prospero interrupted. &quot;They have a method for firing volleys we could use with crosbows. They form into three ranks, the first rank fires, then retires to reload. The second advances and fires on command, then retires to reload. The third rank advances and does the same. By the time they retire, the first rank is ready to advance and fire again.&quot;
Amrik nodded thoughtfully. &quot;It needs discipline, but it is so simple. It's odd that no one has thought of it before.&quot;
&quot;It is also quite devestating&quot; prospero continued. &quot;Each volley is as effective as the first, and the bowmen can advance slowly across the field, clearing all before them. Couple that with a line or two of pikemen and you have an almost unbeatable force, without using any cavalry.&quot;
Rupert continued &quot;Sadly it is true. Their volleys tear apart any cavalry charge. The only attack that seems to work is to flank them and charge from the side, where they cannot bring all their men to bear. It is not often you get that chance though. And even then, cromwell's armored cavalry, his ironsides as we call them, have armor that is bullet proof at the front, so a charge by his cavalry cannot be rupulsed. We have been pushed further and further north, till ... was it yesterday or the day before? we fought at marston moor and were defeated. Cromwell ordered our defeated troops slaughtered as outlaws. If it had not been for prospero and the others, I would be dead. They rescued me, and killed eighteen of cromwell's ironsides in the process.
&quot;The king was in the city of York only a few miles away, it fell the same night, and the king was captured. There was really no where else to which he could flee, the scots further north were marching south in support of cromwell, we were trapped between them. That was yesterday. Today, we six came to where they were trying the king for treason, rescued him, his three advisors, and took the gang of seven prisoner. Prospero then brought all of us here.&quot;
&quot;Now, why is the king so unpopular?&quot;
&quot;I do not know for sure, but I think part of it was raising taxes, the nobles fenced the common areas where the villagers used to graze their cattle, it was illegal to kill any game, including the hares that would eat their vegetables, the tennant farmers were thrown off their land....&quot;
&quot;In otherwords the king and his nobles behaved like kings and nobles always have, screwing everyone else into the muck. Cromwell couldn't have deposed the king and raised an army to fight him without popular support. So cromwell was seen as the defender of the ordinaly people, and could have organized a much better government, only he threw it away. Can you tell us why?&quot;
&quot;He's a religious nut!&quot; paula put in.
Rupert nodded, &quot;That's a fair assessment. He is very pious. There are historical reasons behind the enmity between protestants and catholics...&quot; we digressed into an explanation of the various brands of christianity.
Liz added an explanation about king henry the eighth, his daughters queen mary being catholic, her husband king philip of spain, and elizabeth being protestant and the political reasons why england became protestant.
Rupert added &quot;The king is protestant, but he does not condemn catholics, under his rule they were free to worship. The puritans see catholics as pawns of the devil, and claim their pope is a demon. Cromwell started by forbidding any catholics into his army, but once he was lord protector, he forbade catholic worship, and closed down all their churches. To be catholic was to be seen as subversive, and it wasn't long before the initial witch inquisition targeted witches, irish, jews and catholics. If their pope is a devil, then it is but a short step to regard all catholics as demon worshippers, and so condemn them with witches.&quot;
&quot;So, with political reasons for distrusting catholics, it was expedient to make them enemies of society. Then you put society on a war footing against these enemies, and you control them. Didn't someone called hitler do that in your home?&quot; Amrik looked at me.
&quot;Yes, he had the jews declared as the reasons for all the ills in german society, mobilized the germans on a war footing, and millions of people died. I'd venture that most of the so called good protestants and puritans feel safe from the witch inquisition, and think that only catholics are witches. The terror is there, but it doesn't touch them, and they still support cromwell.&quot; I replied.
We got into a discussion about the mechanics of the politics of hate, and how populations could be controlled. Most of it was new ideas to prince rupert.
Rupert added more details about the puritans. &quot;They have outlawed dancing, drinking, gambling. No one may do any work on sunday because that is the holy day, reserved for religious practice. If you are a traveller, you go hungry on sunday because no one is allowed to cook food and sell it to you. To wear colored clothing or long hair is to proclaim yourself a royalist and an enemy of cromwell.&quot;
We talked about this, then enyil reminded us &quot;Danny, didn't you say that you encountered some entities influencing cromwell?&quot;
We explained about the dream experience, watching rupert grow goggle eyed. Then we continued with the details of what we had encountered on the journey to tarantia.
Durathror commented &quot;It wouldn't be the first time they've done that. Quite possible many of the most evil leaders in human history have been under the influence of those beings.&quot;
&quot;What are they?&quot; rupert asked.
&quot;They aren't a demon in your christian sense of the word, they are more like a pack of wolves, or sharks. That is their nature, they dislike humans, they often act as spoilers. In their own realms they can drain and kill other entities, but in human realms, they are not that dangerous, they must work mainly through human minds. I am perturbed to know they could shift those knights after you. I suspect that now they are gathering strength for another assault. We must deal with them tonight, and deal them such a blow that they do not return. I need to think on this for a bit, but tonight we will collect the two of you.&quot;
&quot;Would it be possible for me to come along?&quot; rupert asked.
&quot;Oh ho! Would you learn to be a sorcerer, prince rupert?&quot;
&quot;That wasn't what I had in mind, I merely wished to see how you deal with them and cromwell. I would like to experience a dream wherein I am aware I am dreaming.&quot;
&quot;Just so, but your cromwell would condemn you as a witch and sorcerer. Well, you may come.&quot;
Amrik commented &quot;So these demons impersonate cromwell's gods, and he worships them and does what they tell him? Then we must show him that his gods are false.&quot;
&quot;Precisely, your majesty. The question is how do we do that. Danny and nalini have already started that process, they have sown the seeds of doubt. Now we must nurture those seeds until they grow and bear fruit.&quot;
Amrik asked a question of all of us. &quot;What are we to do with these puritans? They claim that anyone who does not follow their own religion is a demon worshipper, but so what? Other fanatics are the same. Huh! As far as I am concerned, being a priest or magician is just an excuse for not doing an honest day's work! Most self respecting demons would not waste the time of day on most of the magicians I have met. I doubt that most gods would wast the time of day on most of their priests either.
&quot;We refer to your shadow walking abilities as sorcery, we refer to your powers as sorcery, but neither have anything to do with demons. Are we to hide these from Cromwell because he does not understand, and disapproves?&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;We had to refrain from using terms like that until we brought them here. If they thought they were travelling with sorcerers they would flee for their lives. Now at least they trust us a bit. If prospero wants them to negotiate, he needs to retain their trust. I think we should be careful what we tell him.&quot;
Durathror commented &quot;I would have said rub their noses in it, but if you must retain their trust, then it must be done slowly.&quot;
I added &quot;They will condemn all of you as pagans when they find out you are not christians, unless we can somehow convince them that you are....&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;I have been thinking on that. Our god mithras is represented by the sun, but he is the son of the all seeing father who has no form. He also died and was reborn after a battle with the evil one... Now tell me, why would jesus use the same name and the same words as he used with your people? Could not our mithras and your jesus be one and the same person? Cromwell has already encountered the idea of many earths, and the idea that his god has visited a number of them. I would certainly argue that point with them.&quot;
Rupert responded &quot;They might not accept it, feeling that jesus came to them, and that their mission is to bring jesus to you. I can understand that way of thinking. But as you say, why can't Jesus visit other earths, using different names? If the culture is different, then he needs to teach using different words. You have logic behind you, but it is too new, it is hard for me to accept. It will be much harder for them.&quot;
Amrik decided. &quot;Then we will not pretend to be other than what we are, but we will use prospero's argument that our god and their god are one and the same. If they make too much of a nuisance, I can always have them arrested.&quot;
&quot;But we need cromwell to return to england and dismantle the terror he has set up.&quot; prospero countered. &quot;If we remove him from the scene, then his supporters will continue to support his ideas, just as we still have a resistance movement that supports the old king. We need him to work with the king to set up a parliamentary system that works, so that the king will not be a despot; probably something along the lines we are creating here. We should treat all of them as equals, as part of a delegation from a country who have messed up their government, and are looking for a working alternative to try.&quot;
&quot;But how do we make them think like that?&quot; paula asked.
There was a germ of an idea in my mind. Nalini picked it up and said &quot;Team building!&quot;
At their looks she added &quot;You put them in situations where they cannot do something by themselves, but must rely on each other. There should probably be a religious framework, with organized activities where they have to learn to work with each other.&quot;
I added &quot;You can't remake their personalities, but the idea is to get them past hating each other, at least to a point where they are willing to work together. You can't start feeding them ideas for a new parliamentary framework until then.&quot;
We kicked the idea around for a while, then ajourned to bed. Amrik would leave the organizing to the rest of us, but would help out if we needed him to.

            <Text>Chapter 5
There's a t-shirt I've seen, that reads on the front &quot;Too wired to sleep&quot; and on the back &quot;Too ripped to fuck&quot; That sort of described nalini and i when we finally got to bed. We were hyped with coffee, wired with the energy we'd channeled during the day, and wiped out from the exertion of shifting. Since we were too wired to sleep, we decided to borrow more energy from the gems, and get into some serious energy sharing and balancing. We'd discovered some time back that balancing our energies after a day spent shifting usually required three climaxes. That third orgasm is the best, and after that we can drift off to sleep.
We are telepathic, so when we make love we can feel what the other is feeling, it makes everything that much more intense. Of course, being telepathic does require a special relationship, one where you can share your innermost thoughts with the other person. Nalini is the only person I trust enough, or love enough, to be able to do that with. With borrowed energy we made love three times without stopping, the energy rush building up until the third orgasm. We let that third rush carry us off into the world of dreaming.
We drifted for a short while in colored fogs, content merely to be with one another. After a time we became more awake, and decided we should be somewhere. The fogs dissipated, revealing a tropical island scene with a white sandy beach, a bay with calm seas, sunshine, palm trees, lush green vegetation everywhere. The sky was also shades of green, which made it difficult to determine where the sea ended and the sky began. There were people on the beach and under the shade of the palm trees, mostly islander types in brightly colored shorts or minishirts or swimming costumes. The women were mostly bare breasted. Most of them were not dreamers, nor were they constructs, for they had auras. Many people were dancing to music, but there was different types of music being played on different parts of the beach. Near us a band was playing hawaian style music. Further along the beach another band with steel drums was playing jamaican style music, while in the opposite direction a third band was playing latin american music.
We floated down to join in the party. We were in no hurry, we knew that durathror would round up who he required in his own good time, and he would have no trouble finding us. We swam in the water, we danced to the various bands, along with many other people. Then we noticed the people around us were changing, their vibrations were no longer pleasant, I felt as if sharks were circling, even though they were mostly couples dancing.
&lt;&lt;Their auras don't feel right, do they?&gt;&gt; nalini confirmed my suspicions. We stopped dancing, actually looked around. Almost immediately the scene lost its soft lambent glow, the slightly vaseline lens look, and became hard edged, the colors bright and harsh. The people around us were unchanged, but those more distant lost their auras, indicating they were now constructs.
Someone had sprung a trap on us, hopefully prematurely. &lt;&lt;Let's get out of here!&gt;&gt;. We moved with the thought, but they were ready for us. The circling people all turned to cling to us, eyes and fangs and sharp claws, suddenly become vampires draining our energies. Instinctively we clung to one another, opened up the channels from our torcs, but still we were being drained swiftly.
&lt;&lt;We have to get away!&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;The gems!&gt;&gt;.
We were fading, but the gems were linked with us, and suddenly they opened, channeling huge amounts of energy. The constructs all burned away, evaporating like ice in a blast furnace. The vampires clinging to us became those spikey orange things, but still they clung, and still they drained. We were unable to move, unable to will ourselves elsewhere.
Linked, we were being stripped layer by layer back to some core. With that came a certainty that this had happened before. If we had survived that time, we could survive now, couldn't we? But how? We did not know.
Strangely, neither of us were afraid, it was more a feeling of anger, coupled with the thought &quot;what a stupid way to go&quot; The final death?
Nalini and I are linked, but now the draining had reached a point where they were trying to tear us apart, to tear her from my mind, to break whatever link bound us. We no longer were aware of being separate, we were two halves of some greater whole. Somehow, I/we realized that the attacking entities were astonished that we still existed and resisted, that they thought they had to separate us before they could overpower us.
That tearing at our ties triggered something. Deep within some core, a thought floated out: &quot;We are one! No power may separate us!&quot; A door opened, something ancient and vast looked out. For a moment I/we knew who we were. Once before, something far more powerful, one of the old gods, had tried this, had almost succeeded, but even it had lacked the power to uncreate us. Never again! The fury surfaced, cold as ice, as unstoppable as an earthquake. The orange spikey things were fleeing, but were caught in a net, unable to escape. The fury reached out, and they were not.
Then the door closed, the fury shut down, the memory leached away. We were nothing but awareness in a void.
We are aware therefor we exist. That which exists can be named, and we are named soaring eagle and stalking jaguar. That which is named is called into existance. We reassembled ourselves out of the void. &quot;We create ourselves anew!&quot; Interesting that this is part of the linking process that opens the energy channels in the first place, and tunes our torcs to ourselves.
For a moment we were different, ancient beings with a much colder outlook. Then personalities reassembled, and we were danny and nalini, floating in blackness. &quot;Let there be light.&quot; and there was light. The blackness gave war to swirls of colored fogs. For long moments we clung to one another, digesting the import of what had happened, grateful to be alive. &quot;Let's go find durathror.&quot; Two minds, a single thought.
Nalini was in the form of a dark woman with a jaguar's head, while i was a golden skinned man with an eagle's head. &quot;Who are we?&quot; &quot;What was that?&quot; &quot;I knew who I was, but now I've forgotten.&quot; &quot;There is something very powerful behind whatever links us. Our bond is our true strength.&quot; Who thought which? I do not know.
Instead, we adjourned to the street of cafes beside the university gardens, and waited. The whole incident was hazy, hard to remember, but we discussed what we could remember over coffee until durathror and ra'anor arrived with liz and rupert, plus two guides.
We greeted one another with hugs. Even rupert, who was looking around with interest. Durathror explained &quot;We had to give rupert a jolt to wake him up, he may need more. Are you ready?&quot;
&quot;We think there is something you should know first.&quot; We told them what had happened. They sat there and listened without comment.
Durathror sat forward, his fingeres steepled. &quot;The fact that they attacked might have been expected. You have foiled some plan of theirs by kidnapping cromwell and his cronies, they seek to stop you. It disturbs me that they attacked in such force, and that you were unable to escape the trap. They are strong in their own realm, that is where they took you. We must be carefull in our dealings with them, and not let them convey us elsewhere. The two guides have agreed to go with us, they should notice a trap before we do. Now, do you feel up to accompanying us? Stand up while ra'anor and I will look you over.&quot;
Rupert's face said he wasn't sure he'd made the right choice by asking to come with us, that he'd realized he was out of his depth. He sat there looking worried, toying with his coffee.
Liz asked &quot;So how did they escape? What happened to those orange things?&quot;
Durathror replied &quot;We may never be sure, because these two are hazy about it....&quot;
One of the guides interrupted &quot;We may be able to see things that you others cannot. May we?&quot;
Durathror nodded. &quot;You seem all right to me. No lasting damage, except for a bit of shock perhaps. Go ahead.&quot;
One guide moved to me, the other to nalini. &quot;Please place your hands on me, and think over what you remember.&quot;
I did as instructed, but things did not become any clearer. The guides then conferred in silence for a few moments before one replied. &quot;Their best recollection is that the entities were unmade by what ever power they touched.&quot; Durathror raised his eyebrows and whistled. &quot;As they recollect it, the power came from within them, though this is unlikely. They do have a strong bond, there is some power there, but to command power to unmake they would have to be from the archetype or the primary shadow. The gems they possess are magical items, they must link to such a power.&quot;
Liz looked almost as puzzled as rupert. &quot;Could someone put that in english please?&quot;
The guide started in its pedantic manner, but durathror interrupted &quot;Let me explain, you can add details. To unmake is to uncreate, to make it such that something never existed. I will let you mull over the implications of that, but let me explain it this way. God dreams the archetypes, they in turn dream of the prime shadows. Beings from the prime shadow have the power to make and unmake shadows, but only with immense effort and preparation, not like this. Korum, whom some of you know, is such a being. He could not have done what you did earlier without careful preparation...&quot;
&quot;But we remembered!&quot; both of us said. &quot;When that door opened, we remembered that we have this power. We knew who we are...&quot;
Durathror chuckled and shook his head. &quot;Was it you? Look within, you will see the face of god looking back. Maybe it was that, maybe somehow you do have the power, but nothing else you do indicates anything of the sort. Maybe somehow you are old gods, mascerading as humans, but if it is a mascerade you both play it so well you have forgotten everything. Even your auras are human, surely they would give you away....&quot;
One of the guides interrupted. It was impossible to tell which one was speaking. &quot;The old gods are barred from the shadows. There are circumstances that let them manifest a projection, but to manifest as a human, they would need to disguise themselves so thoroughly that they would lose their godhood and become humans. There have been unconfirmed rumors of this from time to time, but these two are not old gods. We also know that over the eons, a number of beings from the primary shadow have died the final death.&quot;
&quot;What is the final death?&quot; Liz asked it, but we were wondering also.
The guide replied &quot;When every layer that defines you is stripped away, your physical body dies, your dreaming body dies, your spiritual body dies, the four other bodies for which you have no names also die...&quot; It named the other layers, but the names were meaningless jumbles with no sound. &quot;There are those who claim that some devine spark survives to continue, but you would cease to exist. Had this happened to you, you could not remember, for that which remembers would no longer exist.&quot;
Durathror nodded. &quot;Thank you. Now little sister, little brother, do not forget that I was with you the day you used those gems to banish the Stealer of Souls. That power was not yours, nor did it come from the gems.&quot; He turned to rupert. &quot;You represent good by jesus and the archangels, and evil by satan and the devils. However, you will find a much older image, where good is the eagle that soars before the sun, and evil is represented as the serpent that crawls in the dust.&quot;
Rupert nodded &quot;The serpent we use ourselves to represent the devil, but the eagle I do not know.&quot;
Durathror nodded &quot;So things are partly familiar to you. The stealer of souls is one of the old gods, capricious, evil by our standards, one of the serpent's brood. A sorcerer found a way to give him access to the worlds of life. We three fought that sorcerer, but as we were destroying him, he summoned the stealer of souls, who came to lay waste and to devour souls. Those gems are connected with the eagle, he manifested through you two to destroy the serpent's heart, and so banish him.
&quot;It is my opinion that a bond has formed between you and the eagle, that somehow you two have become his proteges. Earlier tonight, those creatures sought to destroy you, to drain you and devour your souls. What ever you did, you opened a door to allow the eagle to act. It may be that if you are ever in such a situation again, he will act again.&quot;
He turned back to rupert again &quot;The eagle is called the lord of light, while the serpent is known as the lord of the abyss. The eagle is represented as a man with golden skin and the head of an eagle, his consort is a dusky skinned woman with the hear of a jaguar or leopard. That is why you two took on those forms, just as you did against the stealer of souls.&quot;
Rupert was shaking his head, looking worried.
&quot;Then why did we remember that this had happened before? Why did we think we remembered who we are?&quot;
Durathror shrugged. &quot;Who knows what the eagle has done? You were in contact with him, it is possible you shared some of his memories. Possibly you thought as you were dying that you were him.&quot;
&lt;&lt;Sounds plausible.&gt;&gt; I thought.
&lt;&lt;But we know what we felt. Danny, we are some kind of fallen being, or something. We must have done something bad, and been banished. That's what I feel anyway.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I know what you mean. One day we have to follow this up. I've got no idea where to start though. Soaring Eagle and Stalking Jaguar hey? One day we'll return to our original home though. One day we'll remember everything.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;One day sweetie pie. We have a bond that can't be broken. I've always felt that, now we've confirmed that.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I promised I would come for you, and there's something about crossing the fires of hell to do so. I wonder what we are, or were?&gt;&gt;.
We were looking at each other wordlessly. Durathror was still talking. &quot;I do not know what the ramifications are of what you did tonight. Shall we look for cromwell?&quot;
&quot;Okay. What about prospero and paula?&quot;
&quot;I was just telling you! Are you two with us, or are you off somewhere else?&quot;
&quot;Sorry durathror,&quot; we both responded, &quot;we were talking about something.&quot;
He made a rueful smile. &quot;Well, if you two can stop admiring each other for a little while, I will tell you again. Prospero said he does not want to jeopardise his position as a negotiator. He and paula have other plans. Enyil will be waiting for us in cromwell's bedroom. Shall we go?&quot;
In cromwell's bedroom, many of the opulant hangings had been removed, and were piled up in the corner. Beside them were most of the ornaments, the paintings, just about every bit of decoration in fact, along with cushions.
Enyil was waiting for us, with amrik. Enyil appeared much as she does in waking, with a tartan skirt, white lace up bodice. Amrik looked a little younger, his dark hair longer and caught back in a headband, wearing the boots and leather kilt that reminded me of what roman soldiers would wear. He had a red cloak, and a huge broadsword with a black blade.
We made a remark about the hangings, amrik replied &quot;It was a waste giving them these rooms. I think the servant's quarters on level one would have been more appropriate.&quot;
Durathror made us tell enyil about what had happened to us. Amrik swore &quot;By mithras! They sound like demons.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;I think we should all change our forms before we follow cromwell. We don't want to tip our hands immediately we arrive.&quot; She switched into something more angelic looking. We followed suit, except for amrik and rupert, who had to be coached. After a few attempts they both managed to look angelic. Amrik was reluctant to leave his sword, but was finally persuaded to.
Enyil had all of us touch her, then she cupped the chord that extended from cromwell's sleeping body. There was a blur of movement, and we were off.
Fluffy white clouds, mother of pearl behind them, and stained glass windows floating around. Choirs of angels sang sweetly, while others played music on gold harps and lyres. Everything was white and gold. The seven puritans were dirty splashes, each one kneeling in prayer. On a throne of gold sat a jesus like figure, dazzling white robes, white face, brown hair and beard, piercingly blue eyes. He was almost pretty.
We floated around making admiring noises and moving closer to the puritans, who seemed oblivious to everything.
Then the jesus figure noticed us. &quot;Greetings my children. You may approach.&quot; Cromwell and matthew both looked around at this.
&quot;Greetings, oh lamb of god.&quot; durathror responded. &quot;You are he, aren't you?&quot;
&quot;I am he who takes away the sin of the world.&quot;
The rest of us stopped beside the puritans, while durathror continued forward. We tapped the puritans to attract their attentions. Enyil used her telepathy to inform all of them to be quiet and to pay close attention. Durathror stated &quot;Blessed be, oh lamb of god, lucifer, bearer of the light.&quot;
There were gasps from matthew and one other, but enyil shooshed them. The jesus figure smiled beatifically, and inclined its head. &quot;What do you want?&quot;
Durathror had done some bible study at some time in the past. All the titles he proceeded to bestow upon the jesus figure were used somewhere in the old testament to refer to Satan, the adversary of god.
&quot;Oh great prince, who has set his throne above the stars, bearer of the light, lord of the holy city of babylon, we unworthy creatures crave your blessing.&quot;
&quot;Now how did you gain admittance here? My blessing is only for those who are worthy of it.&quot;
&quot;'Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened to ye.'. We sought oh mighty lord of the air, we knocked oh lucifer the light bearer, and the door was opened to us. And so like dives and lazarus, we have entered through the eye of the needle. You are he who walked in the garden of eden, whose trappings are gems and gold, you offered our forfather adam the fruit of the tree of knowledge, and the fruit of the tree of life. For this we are eternally greatful. You are the spiritual father of cain, and of esau, and all their descendents. We are your chosen people, you are the wellspring from which we flow. We most humbly beseech you oh lord of the earth that you might dip your little finger into the waters of life that flow from the holy city of babylon, and place the merest drop upon our tongues, that we might be blessed for all eternity, that we might enter through the ishtar gate into the holy city, and dwell there with the blessed.&quot; He bowed low.
The jesus figure looked puzzled, as if it had realized that something was not quite right, but it could not put its finger on it. &quot;You must earn my blessing. Are you prepared to carry out my wishes, and proclaim me supreme lord throughout the universe?&quot;
&quot;Of course, most holy and puissant prince of the powers of the air. Your merest whim is our command.&quot;
The jesus figure looked about, looked at us assembled by the puritans, then looked back at durathror. &quot;Would you root out all evil and devil worship? Would you purge your land of all who do not worship me?&quot;
Durathror responded &quot;We will scourge them with whips and with chains, we will burn them with fire, until they are no more! We will flay them alive in our zeal to persecute those who will not acknowledge you as lord!&quot;
&lt;&lt;He's overdoing it.&gt;&gt; i thought.
&lt;&lt;Maybe he wants to push this to a resolution?&gt;&gt; nalini throught.
The jesus figure stretched its arms into the air and waved them. &quot;Peter! John! James! Come hither! Your lord has need of you!&quot;
Cromwell rose to his feet. He seemed to be trembling, but his voice was firm, even mild. &quot;Most blessed savior! You have many names. Will you take us to dwell with you in the holy city of babylon, oh lucifer the light bearer? Will you also bestow your blessing upon us, most powerful prince of the air?&quot;
The jesus figure bestowed a beatific smile upon cromwell. &quot;Of course, my beloved servant. You have earned my blessing, these others must still earn it.&quot;
The other three arrived beside the jesus figure. Cromwell continued his questions &quot;Then you are also the king of the holy city of babylon as isiah says, and the king of the holy city of tyre as ezekial says?&quot;
The jesus figure turned to his three helpers. &quot;Investigate these newcomers, determine if their zeal be real.&quot; He turned back to cromwell. &quot;I am he of whom the prophets speak.&quot;
Cromwell drew himself up. &quot;Then I know you for what you are. For isiah says in chapter fourteen 'Take up this taunt for the king of babylon: the Lord has broken your staff... you have been cast from the heavens, oh morningstar... you said in your heart 'I will ascend to heaven, I will set my throne above the stars.''&quot; There was shock on the face of the jesus figure. The other three reached durathror, but he sprang back to stand beside cromwell.
Cromwell glared at him, and continued his speach, his voice firming. &quot;Ezekial says in chapter twenty eight 'Take up a lament for the king of tyre: you were in the garden of eden with the Lord your god, your trappings were every precious stone and gold,... you were the annointed cherub, you were perfect, I placed you there on the holy mountain... but you filled your heart with unrighteousness, in your pride you fought with your Lord,... therefore I cast you down into the abyss!'&quot; He was stabbing his finger into the air in his fury. &quot;I name you satan, adversary of the Lord God!&quot;
Durathror spread his hands, and fire flowed from his fingertips, spreading out to form a ring around us, barring passage to the jesus figure or the others. He called out in a loud voice &quot;In the name of God Most High, I command you to reveal your true natures!&quot; He clapped his hands with a sound like thunder.
The choirs of angels vanished, to be replaced by the screams of the damned. The jesus figure and the other three became hideous demons, with horns, maggots crawling over their rotting bodies, and surrounded by a sickening stench. They screamed curses. The jesus figure screamed &quot;I know you, I will follow you all the days of your life, I will make you long for death...&quot;
Nalini and I returned to the forms we'd had earlier the evening, the jaguar headed woman and the eagle headed man. Something prompted us to speak, words that had hidden in the recesses of our minds for this moment. &quot;And we know you. This is your only warning. Harm the least of these, and we will come for you, and deal with you as we dealt with your companions.&quot;
The demon figure had to look up at us now, we were head and shoulders taller. Fury and fear chased across its face. &quot;You!&quot; it shrieked. &quot;You are the ones! You... unmade... them!&quot; its voice fell to a sob. It backed away hurriedly, almost falling over itself. The other three fled with it, followed by five more that had been skulking behind us.
Cromwell looked like he couldn't decide wether to explode with apoplexy, or collapse into tears. The other puritans were standing dumfounded, mouths open. Come to think of it, so was rupert.
Durathror turned to the rest of us. &quot;Let's demolish this, and go.&quot; He spread his hands out like a priest bestowing a benediction on the masses. &quot;In the name of the most high god, I command you to dissolve and be gone!&quot; There was a flash of lightning and a peal of thunder. As arial says in shakespeare's play The Tempest, the cloud capped towers and palaces all dissolved, leaving nothing behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made of... and we were surrounded by colored swirls of fog.
Durathror instructed us to grab a puritan each, and ensure that all of us held either him or enyil. Then there was a sense of movement, and we were back in the street with the outdoor cafes. He grabbed a table and pulled it like modelling clay, increasing its size until it was large enough for all of us to sit around. Waiters brought chairs, coffees and a selection of delicious looking cakes. It wasn't until I sat down that I realized we had all reverted to our normal appearances.
The puritans had begun talking amongst themselves, but cromwell shushed them. He looked at us and remarked &quot;I know who you are. But what are you? Are you also demons, come to dupe me?&quot;
Durathror replied &quot;No Lord Cromwell, we are godly people sent to rescue you from the clutches of the evil one. I am glad you asked him, you saved me the trouble of forcing him to admit his identity.&quot;
Cromwell nodded. &quot;At first, I could not believe my ears when you called him lucifer. But he did not deny it, or even remark upon it. Then I realised that your words were a trick to alert me without alerting him. I realized that he had duped me.&quot;
Matthew exclaimed &quot;Lucifer Morningstar! How could we have been taken in?&quot;
Cromwell's anger was fading, now he looked old and sad. &quot;Because we failed our test of faith. We did not follow our scriptures, and test everything that appeared, and every word they said, against our scriptures.&quot; He indicated nalini, liz and me. &quot;These three came to me last night, and warned me to test everything I had been told against my bible. I began reading my bible when I woke this morning.&quot;
&quot;We must do something about it!&quot; Matthew shouted.
Cromwell rubbed his forhead and temples with his hands. &quot;We must undo what we have done. But...&quot; he turned to face me &quot;I'll not let that despot sit there prating about the devine right of kings. He brought the country to ruin.&quot;
Amrik spoke. &quot;And what he did not ruin, you and your cronies did! You are no better than he is, neither of you are fit to rule.&quot;
Cromwell looked hard at amrik for several moments, as if he did not recognize him. Finally he spoke &quot;Your majesty! You are right, we have done a very poor job. Very well, we shall undo what we have done, but what do we do about the king and the parliament?&quot;
Amrik banged his hand on the table. &quot;You do what we are doing. No one should have the supreme powers that kings have, we are not gods with the wisdom to wield such power. The king and the parliament must work together to govern...&quot; He launched into an explanation of how he was restructuring the government of aquilonia. Enyil joined in, along with several of the puritans.
Durathror turned to nalini and me. &quot;You two have surprised me today. I was debating the best way to prevent them from attempting to carry out their curse. Ra'anor, enyil and I are safe from them, you two have proved that you are safe, but the others would not be safe.&quot;
Ra'anor added &quot;It was a risky course you took though.&quot;
Durathror shook his head &quot;Not really. We could protect them all where they were, the worst that could happen would be for those creatures to laugh, and then later to come back to carry out their curse, to lie in wait for each one when we enter dreaming. That was their threat, it is within their power to carry it out. Now that they know that danny and nalini were responsible for unmaking the others, then danny's threat is real for them.&quot; He turned toward us again. &quot;I have to hand it to you two, you have a knack of making enemies of the old gods, and the small gods...&quot;
&quot;Is that what you call those creatures?&quot;
&quot;Collectively. There are many different types of entities that do not possess physical bodies. Those orange creatures, the blue puffball ones, and the tree trunk ones are but three; all are reasonably powerfull in their own realms, and can interact with humans. We refer to all of them as small gods. Do not confuse them with elementals, who are more like mischevious monkeys. They may claim power, but they have none. Small gods have power, and we call them small gods because they often pose as gods to living creatures. Gods are more powerful, and include beings like korum, and some that do not posess living bodies. Many of the gods you would probably call demons, for they are evil, while these small gods are not.&quot;
&quot;I would say that what we saw today was evil behaviour. If that isn't evil, what is?&quot; I was a little puzzled.
Durathror sighed. &quot;All part of your ongoing education. Humans can exhibit evil traits, but for the most part you would not call them demons. Just so with these orange small gods. They can be evil, certainly they do not like humans, but they are not demons. I made them appear like christian devil for cromwell's benefit. By the way, did you know that devil is derived from the words for small god?&quot;
&quot;We learn something every day.&quot; nalini responded.
Rupert suddenly sat forward and spoke. &quot;It sounds reasonable. The dev part would derive from the latin deus for god, the romans wrote V for U, but I'm not sure about the il part. Maybe it's from the greek?&quot;
Durathror turned to face him, and twirled his moustache before answering. &quot;I was not aware you were listening in. But yes, devil is small god, while demon is something quite different. Demons are actively hostile to all life, demons are active in trying to persuade every living creature to cause pain and suffering in others. They are fairly single minded about it, so they tend to be rather unimaginative. That is just as well for us.
&quot;Devils on the other hand tend to be more human like, and show inventiveness and imagination in their schemes. So although they have less power than demons, they tend to cause more problems. I hope we have now finished this little scheme of theirs, in which case cromwell and the king can be more co-operative toward one another.&quot;
We discussed things for a time. Rupert rapidly lost interest in the proceedings, and became fascinated with the play of light on the surface of his cup of coffee. Not long after he faded out. Several of the puritans did likewise, but cromwell and matthew had staying power, and continued discussing the finer points of government with Amrik and Enyil. Liz moved from her position beside rupert's empty seat to sit beside me. I sat beside nalini, who sat beside durathror, who sat next to ra'anor. She was sitting next to rupert's empty seat. Durathror smiled, closed his eyes for a moment, and suddenly the long table split in two, we were sitting around one, amrik, enyil, cromwell and matthew sitting around the other.
&quot;How do you do that?&quot; nalini asked.
&quot;Yeah, we've tried, but with no success.&quot;
He tapped the side of his nose knowingly, and winked. &quot;Ah, it is almost as hard as changing the world of waking. The personal power of all the inhabitants is hooked into the making of this realm. But you already know the principles involved, this is shape shifting, just as you shifted your shapes earlier. It is simply a matter of whether your personal power can override that of the inhabitants. Mine can. This was not just idle fiddling, the first time was both test and demonstration, this second time was a demonstration for your benefit.&quot;
&quot;And that comes with time and practice. I suppose we could be more focussed in our practice.&quot;
&quot;It is all a matter of what you want. You both apply yourselves to your martial arts practice. If you spent as much time in waking practicing sorcery you would be better sorcerers. Perhaps those small gods would not have lead you to their realm.&quot;
Liz remarked &quot;So practicing in dreaming isn't enough?&quot;
Durathror shook his head. &quot;No, dreaming practice is but the first step. Here you learn the doing of something, the principles involved. Not this realm, but other ones, where there is just your personal power. Then you progress to other dreaming realms where the doing becomes harder, until you reach a point where your power is sufficient for you to begin practicing in waking. To try practicing in waking before you reach that point would set your endeavours back.&quot;
&quot;But don't I need a torc first?&quot;
&quot;Ah, this is a common misconception amongst novices. The torc is but an amplifier, you must put something in to get something back. What is more, it is not linear, but something like logarythmic...&quot; Seeing the look on her face, he stopped and explained. &quot;When the input level is low, there is no amplification, but as the input level increases, so the amplification factor increases. Until you reach a threshhold level of personal power, a torc will do nothing for you.
&quot;None of us actually need a torc to shift, the torc allows us to shift further, and for longer by supplementing our own powers. You will be close to that level before you are given a torc. For a start, you must be able to control the power, otherwise all manner of strange things could occur.&quot;
&quot;What sort of strange things?&quot;
&quot;You have heard of poltegeists?&quot; Liz nodded. &quot;They are almost entirely the result of uncontrolled energies of pubescent children. There are other entities involved in some of the more bizare phenomena. Your energies will be much more than that, if you cannot control them, it could be very traumatic for you and those around you.&quot;
&quot;So are there any other exercises that I should be doing?&quot;
Durathror smiled, twirled his moustache again. &quot;There are many exercises you could be doing, but if you are doing all the ones we taught nalini, then that is more than enough. You do not want to over train, that tires you and drains you. If an exercise is not working, then it should be changed. You appear to be progressing satisfactorily though. But if you like, one evening I will run you through some tests.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I'd like you to do that, I think.&quot;
He turned to look at us. &quot;Nalini, danny, you have no objections?&quot;
&quot;No, we'd appreciate it. We're not sure either of us is advanced enough to teach others.&quot;
&quot;We'd appreciate the feedback. After all, we're not training paula and prospero.&quot;
&quot;Yes, paula and prospero need more experienced teachers. But liz is still working up to wearing a torc, you are experienced enough to teach her.&quot;
Ra'anor suddenly asked &quot;Liz, do you have a boyfriend?&quot;
&quot;Uh.. no, I guess I just haven't found the right person yet.&quot;
Ra'anor nodded &quot;That's good really. Now that you are developing as a sorcerer, you will find you have less and less in common with people who are not sorcerers. You should have a boyfriend who is also a sorcerer, and that will help your development.&quot;
&quot;You mean like paula found prospero?&quot;
&quot;Not quite, although they train together and they share energies. If you can find someone like prospero, then that would be good. But I meant someone like danny, or when nalini started she had korum for a boyfriend. Someone more advanced than you are, who can stimulate you to grow.&quot; Ra'anor explained.
&quot;Can't you guys do that? Why do I need to find myself a boyfriend?&quot;
Ra'anor laughed softly. &quot;Nalini and I cannot, even if we wanted to, and you wanted us to. Men and women have different energies, you must balance your female energies with those of a male. If your sexual preference is for women, then I am afraid you have a problem....&quot;
Liz went &quot;Ulp! No, I'm not lesbian.&quot;
Ra'anor continued &quot;Danny or durathror could, but I'm sure you will understand that they will not. Energy balancing would involve them having sex with you.&quot;
&quot;Oh... I just rememebred that nalini did mention something about that.&quot;
Nalini responded &quot;We haven't taught you much about energy balancing through sex simply because it isn't easy to explain without actually doing it.&quot;
&quot;Oh... I see. Er... how did paula and prospero learn then?&quot;
Ra'anor looked directly at me. I looked at nalini. She looked an me, smiled, then made a resigned grimace. &lt;&lt;I guess we tell the truth.&gt;&gt;. Aloud she replied &quot;Danny taught her. I asked him to...&quot; Liz's mouth dropped open, her eyes widened. &quot;..and I was linked to both of them while it happened. I shared the entire experience.&quot;
&quot;And prospero doesn't know this.&quot; I added. &quot;But don't worry liz. You're safe.&quot;
&quot;I'm relieved. But should I be offended? Nalini can I ask why you asked danny to? I mean...&quot;
&quot;Well, to be honest, I'm not sure exactly what either of us was thinking at the time. We'd just been through a very dangerous episode, with the promise of more to follow. That sort of thing affects your judgement a bit. The little minx was practically throwing herself at danny. It just sort of happened. Somehow I had the idea that she could practice energy balancing with danny without getting involved in sex. I even told them I'd make sure it didn't go any further. Then I linked with danny, we linked minds with paula, started the exercises, and next thing we were having sex. But at least paula learned the basics, which she and prospero practice. So don't be offended. But if you ever start throwing yourself at danny, we'll consider it!&quot;
Liz smiled. &quot;I'm not offended. But I won't be throwing myself at danny either.&quot;
Ra'anor interupted &quot;Liz, we don't want to put pressure on you, but when you reach the stage of shadow shifting, it would help if you did have a partner for energy balancing.&quot;
&quot;Well, I'd like to have a boyfriend too, but so far no one has shown up who's suitable.&quot; She looked down at the table. &quot;Besides, I'm still a virgin.&quot;
I suspected she meant she hadn't had sex since she was raped. Nalini and I went along with her little deception. &quot;Hey, that's easily fixed!&quot; I quipped. &quot;But seriously liz, don't do anything you're not comfortable with.&quot;
Ra'anor asked &quot;What about that nice young prince who's been escorting you around?&quot;
Liz made a face. &quot;He's okay, but... I think he's just fascinated because I'm the first black chick he's seen.&quot;
&quot;Black!?&quot; durathror exclaimed. &quot;Brown surely! You're no darker than I am.&quot;
Ra'anor urged &quot;Why not try him out? What's the big deal about being a virgin anyway? In my culture, the shaman deflowered every girl immedately after her first blood.&quot;
&quot;Erk! Sounds a bit primitive to me.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;Liz, if you weren't a virgin, I'd say go ahead and sleep with him, but only if you want to. I guess it's a harder decision being a virgin.&quot; She smirked suddenly. &quot;I think I've forgotten what it was like, it was so long ago. I agree with ra'anor, what's the big deal? Seriously though, it's best to have a good lover, especially if you're inexperienced. But you'll have to lose it sometime. If i were in your shoes, I'd give him a try.&quot;
Liz shrugged, with the look of someone who was considering this advice. I asked &quot;You got any contraception?&quot;
She shook her head. &quot;I did try the pill, but it bloats me.&quot;
&quot;Condoms are safer anyway. We'll fetch some for you tomorrow. Then it's your business.&quot;
Ra'anor remarked &quot;Liz, at the risk of shocking you again, in my culture, a girl couldn't get married unless she had a child to prove she was fertile. Marriage was to do with providing for children. Once a girl was deflowered, she could bestow her favors where she wished.&quot;
&quot;It doesn't shock me&quot; liz replied. &quot;It's just that I was brought up to be a virgin when I married....&quot; suddenly she looked sad. &quot;At least the nuns did. My parents said it didn't really matter, us black fellas don't see it as important as the white fellas do...&quot; She was reverting to dialect again, indicating she was nervous. She put her right hand to her mouth, began chewing the knuckle.
I put my hand on top of her left hand, patted it. &quot;Liz, don't fret. We've all had bad things happen in the past. Any man who is worthy of you will accept you as you are. You're a wonderful person, don't forget that.&quot;
Nalini leaned forward, placed her hand on top of mine. &quot;Liz, don't let us pressure you. Do what you are comfortable with. Be true to yourself, we'll always support you.&quot;
Durathror and ra'anor exchanged a significant glance. Durathror said quietly &quot;Liz, the nuns value virginity only because they take an oath of virginity. The whole thing is completely misguided. Sex is a source of power, a source of enjoyment. Nuns and monks with their denial of the body come from the same tradition as these puritans. They are all anti pleasure, because they regard any pleasure as demonic.&quot;
Ra'anor leaned forward, studied liz intently. &quot;Liz, we viharani regard sex as a gift, we bestow our favors on whom we will, but if the intended partner has a partner of his own, then his partner must know and freely agree. So when danny taught paula, he didn't go behind nalini's back, she asked him to teach paula, and was with him while he did. Your past may have made you who you are today, but you past is dead and gone, and no longer important. You are born anew each day. But you must let your past go, just as nalini has let hers go. Only then can you get on with your life and enjoy sex as it was meant to be enjoyed. Danny completed nalini's healing, your healing won't be complete until you find yourself a good man.&quot;
Liz looked at ra'anor, and said slowly &quot;You know, don't you?&quot;
&quot;We worked some of it out, and some of it we read in your aura. What was important at the time was that what happened was against your will, but it is no more important than if you fell and broke your arm.&quot;
Durathror chuckled &quot;Liz, if it has been more than a year, you are re-virginated. No man will ever be able to tell the difference.&quot;
&quot;Gee thanks. That's so reassuring.&quot;
&quot;Hey, a real man wants his partner to have skills, he doesn't want a virgin. There is no power in virgnity, that's a lie spread by priests to control people. In making people take vows of virginity, the church repressed any chance of people discovering their power. Look at nalini's ancestral culture instead.&quot;
Nalini nodded. &quot;We'll take you through india some time liz. But the old temples are full of carvings of gods and godesses having sex, in many different poses. You've heard of the karma sutra? That's indian. And indians invented tantric yoga, which is the yoga of sexual techniques to develop power. Of course, they got off the track, what danny and I do when we make love isn't tantric yoga, but something more powerful.&quot;
Liz suddenly snorted with laughter, and covered her mouth. &quot;Yeah, I heard you two tonight.&quot;
&quot;And you'll learn that too liz...&quot; &quot;..and one day you and your partner will be able to...&quot; &quot;..make noises like that!&quot; nalini finished laughing.
Liz smiled, a happy sincere smile. &quot;It's okay, I'm over my past. Occasionally it upsets me when I think about it. These days I don't have sex because I don't have a boyfriend, and I don't have a boyfriend because I haven't found one I like enough.&quot;
&quot;Well, you're hanging around with the wrong guys, or not hanging around in the right places.&quot;
Liz looked at me for a moment, then smiled. &quot;I know you didn't mean that the way it sounds. Aboriginal guys accept me as I am, white guys don't. To most of them I'm just some dirty abbo slut.&quot;
&quot;Okay, you know I didn't meant it that way. You've been hanging around with the wrong types of guys, regardless of their ethnic background. You need to set your sights higher. So hey, what's so bad about a german prince? But now you're learning to be a sorcerer, it will be harder for you to find a partner, because you will want someone who is a sorcerer. The ones from our culture are in short supply. Even nalini is from a different shadow.&quot;
Liz smiled sardonically. &quot;Lotsa people would argue we're not from the same culture either.&quot;
&quot;Yeah? Liz, don't get pedantic. We both grew up in Australia, but neither of us are wasps. Our ethnic backgrounds are different, but culturally we're both Australian.&quot;
&quot;I always thought you were pure white.&quot;
&quot;Hey, that's for the nazis and the ku klux klan, or is that the clueless clan?&quot;
&quot;Sorry, I meant European. We usually call everyone whites, just like they call us blacks.&quot;
&quot;Lots of Europeans would take offence at being lumped with other Europeans, they've fought wars over that. Liz, have I ever referred to you as black? As durathror said, you're not black, and I'm not white. Kinda pink perhaps, but not white. I'm part Polish, part Scottish, and part Chinese. And didn't you tell me you were part European yourself? I don't think the term 'racially pure' has any meaning.&quot;
Liz shook her head, but she was smiling. &quot;It's okay, I just get a bit touchy at times. I tend to stereotype you as white, I know I shouldn't stereotype people, that's exactly what we complain whites do about aborigines.&quot;
&quot;In fact, as my grandfather tells it, he might have married an aboriginal.&quot;
Liz looked at me. &quot;I haven't heard this. I didn't even know you were part Chinese. So tell me about it.&quot;
&quot;Well, as grandfather Frajnjo (that is pronounced fry-nyo) tells it, he came out here as a single Polish Jew on an assisted passage just after WW2. He'd lost most of his family to the nazis. In return for his assisted passage, he had to work where the government sent him for two years. He was a tailor by trade, so they dropped him in some remote outback settlement miles from the nearest town as a laborer. The labor camp was basically single men, and many of them didn't have good English. None of the Australian girls on the farms around or in the town would be seen dead with a wog, especially a Jewish one, so that left the local aboriginal settlement, and a couple of families of Chinese market gardeners. The Chinese families didn't associate with Australians mainly because the Australians ostracized them, they kept pretty much to themselves. The aboriginals avoided whites for the same reason, but a lot of the aboriginal girls started hanging around the camp when the guys were off duty. They started relationships with the guys, some of them even got married.&quot;
Liz was nodding. &quot;Yeah, apparently it happened a lot with those labor camps. My grandfather is a German geologist, for much the same reason. A lot more never got married, just pregnant. So your grandfather might have a couple of little black bastards running around somewhere.&quot;
I had to be careful exactly what I said here. My grandad had said he thought the aboriginal girls who hung round the camp were low class, dirty, and drank too much. Mind you, he said the same about most of the European guys in the camp as well. He'd never said, but he gave me the impression he'd never had sex with any of the aboriginal girls. That impression could have been for grandma's consumption of course, he might have told a different tale to the guys down the pub.
&quot;He's never said. I think if he had got a girl pregnant, he'd have married her, he was brought up that way. But apparently he went into town one day because he wanted some cloth, some thread and so on to make some clothes, and it turned out the only shop that sold anything like that was run by the Chinese. They sold their produce, but they also sold a lot of other things as well. He was making clothes for the guys in the camp, and some of the aboriginals as well, and he used to go into town every Saturday to buy things from the Chinese. He got to know them quite well, and married one of the daughters.&quot;
Liz chuckled. &quot;Yeah, I guess they were in much the same boat as the aboriginals, none of the locals wanted to socialize with them. But with a camp full of single guys the girls had an option of marrying out. Like I said, my mother's father is a German geologist. We think the rest are probably full blood aboriginal, but we're not sure who my father's father was. My father was one of the stolen children, they took him from his mother when he was three months old and stuck him with some white family. But we know who his mother is, and they've been reunited. She's not sure who his father is though, but he could be someone from a labor camp. Hey! maybe he's your grandad! Then we'd be related!&quot;
I had to laugh at this. &quot;I think it would be a huge ask, he was in a labor camp down south, but hey, wouldn't it be great if we're long lost relatives! I'll have to ask him discretely one day, when grandma's not in hearing range.&quot; I put my arm around her shoulder and gave her a brotherly hug. She did the same to me. &quot;Should I call you cous'?&quot;
&quot;Nah, it probably isn't true anyway. I just said it to see how you would react.&quot;
&quot;Did I pass?&quot;
&quot;Yep!&quot;
Ra'anor interrupted &quot;Liz, in my culture, no child is sure who is the father, but everyone knows who their mother is. What is important is who cares for you, who assumes the role of parent.&quot;
&quot;And besides, there's so much raping goes on in all the wars they've fought around the world that lots of people are more ethnically mixed than they think. Not to mention all the women having a little bit on the side. But Liz, we're all individuals, judge us by our own actions, not other people's. Which gets me back to my original point, you're not looking in the right places for a boyfriend.&quot;
Liz put her right hand on top of nalini's patting her hand and mine. &quot;Most of the whites I've come in contact with weren't nice people. You guys are helping me unlearn that. Besides, both of you are accepted by my parents, did you know? My mum even said ... er ... 'he's not aboriginal, but he's a good boy anyway.'&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Liz, that's nice to know. Your parents are good people. That's what counts, not skin color or where you grew up, or what accent you speak with. Now, getting back to the boyfriend topic, what I used to do was classify men into several categories. There's ones like danny and korum, sorcerers and potential life companions, then there's friends, you can consider a sexual relationship with them, but it probably won't ever make the grade into category one, then there's the hunks that aren't friendship or partner material, but they turn you on at the time, and then there's the rest, you don't consider them for anything at all. I'd classify rupert as a potential friend, even if he is attracted to you because you're exotic. Don't forget we girls wear mini skirts to attract men, but once you have their attention, you have to move on beyond that level of attraction. So use your dark skin to attract his attention, it's an advantage you have over all the white girls he knows. Then go on and do something with his attention, so you can progress to being friends, or lovers, or both. I think going to bed with a German prince would be good for you, but that's going to be my last word on the subject. I think you should get laid, by a good man, it'll do you the world of good. But only with someone you feel comfortable having sex with, otherwise don't do something you'll regret later.&quot;
Liz put on a mock grimace. &quot;I'll think about it, that's all.&quot;
Ra'anor added &quot;Liz, if you fall off a horse, the remedy is to get back in the saddle as soon as possible. You haven't done that, which is what makes it harder.&quot;
 We slept late. Everyone had left, except for the servants cleaning. The sun had been up for several hours. We washed and dressed rapidly, then headed down to the breakfast room.
The breakfast room is on the east side of the castle, with a large open area that looks out into a private garden. There were small tables set out everywhere, brightly colored awnings, flowing plants and so on to make the place inviting. It made me think of holiday resort. There were a number of groups of people eating. We spotted rupert sitting with the other three cavaliers, and at a nearby table liz and paula talking.
We stopped to say hi to the four soldiers. After the initial pleasantries, I asked &quot;What are your plans for today?&quot;
They shrugged. &quot;Do some sightseeing perhaps.&quot; one of them suggested.
Rupert added &quot;The lady Elizabeth has agreed to do some sightseeing with me. Why?&quot;
&quot;Oh, it's just that the king normally has a work out session, including some mock fighting, around mid morning. We will be attending, I thought you all might like to attend too, and perhaps participate if you like. Then you can sightsee in the afternoon.&quot;
They looked at one another, nodded. Tobias replied &quot;I think we might enjoy that. Would you convey us there?&quot;
&quot;No worries, we'll collect you when we're about to go. Prince Rupert, if you have other arrangements, then some other day perhaps. &quot;
We took our leave, and joined liz and paula. &quot;Hi guys!&quot; Paula smiled, then frowned. &quot;I've got no secrets with you lot. Did you have to go and tell liz about us?&quot;
I chuckled. &quot;Well paula, if it embarrasses you, don't do it. If you do it, don't be embarrassed about it. We're not.&quot;
She sighed. &quot;I just don't want prospero to know. I certainly don't want him to know I'm pregnant.&quot;
&quot;He's going to have to know some time.&quot; nalini responded.
&quot;Yeah, well, if we ever get married he can think the child is his. It's less hassle that way. If we don't get married, then it's none of his business.&quot;
&quot;Don't you want the child to know who its father is?&quot; Liz asked.
&quot;Is it important? I mean, in an ideal world, danny and i'd get married, and there would be no problem. As it is, it'll only cause problems won't it.&quot;
I shook my head. &quot;Paula, I think it should all be out in the open.&quot;
Nalini nodded. &quot;I agree. But we also have prospero's feelings to consider. He's going to be hurt when he finds out, and the longer you wait, the more hurt he will be.&quot;
Paula looked exasperated. &quot;Hey, I didn't ask to get pregnant! If i wasn't, there wouldn't be any issue, would there? There's no reason for prospero to know who I've had sex with in the past. It's not his child, does it concern him? If we get married, I plan to tell him it's his. Okay?&quot;
&quot;Paula, if it were out in the open, you wouldn't have to be defensive about it.&quot; nalini said placatingly. &quot;But let's not spoil breakfast. You know our opinions, but you are the child's mother. We will respect your decisions.&quot;
Paula made a wry smile. &quot;It's okay, I'm not upset, just a little annoyed that ra'anor engineered a situation like that. She doesn't think it matters, but she's not from my shadow either.&quot;
&quot;But she knows you don't want prospero to know, she won't spill the beans to him.&quot;
&quot;No, but she'll make a point of telling everyone else, until I'm forced to tell prospero. The more people who know, the more chance of some chance remark being made.&quot;
&quot;Hey paula, I won't tell anyone. I'm not a gossip. But can we talk about it now, so I don't feel tempted to ask questions later?&quot; Liz asked.
&quot;I thought we had talked about it. What else do you want to know?&quot;
&quot;I guess I'm curious. It doesn't make for any awkwardness between you and nalini?&quot;
I think we all shook our heads. Nalini replied &quot;If it had been sex for the sake of sex, or they'd tried to do it behind my back, then things would be awkward. But we treated it as a special occasion. Danny was training paula, so it was a lot like an initiation ceremony.&quot;
Paula added &quot;Neither of them reacted how I'd expect them too. Danny wasn't guilty about it, nalini wasn't condemning. It was more like 'hey, it's happened, that's cool. We enjoyed it, did you?', so I don't feel guilty or awkward. Nalini and I get along well.&quot;
Liz shook her head. &quot;I don't think I could handle my boyfriend having sex with say you or nalini.&quot;
Nalini said &quot;Well, if danny were someone else, I might be upset. But danny and I are linked, I know that it can't affect how we feel about each other. Besides, I asked him to train paula. If it comes to it, I might agree for him to train you liz, but that's something we can discuss if the time ever arrives. I know he won't ever go behind my back...&quot;
&quot;Well he can't can he?&quot; paula interrupted. &quot;He's telepathic with you, so you'd always know.&quot;
&quot;But that's not the point&quot; I replied. &quot;Even if we weren't telepathic, I would never go behind nalini's back. She has to know and agree. And besides, since it's happened, paula has stopped throwing herself at me.&quot;
&quot;Hey, that's only 'cause prosero's around!&quot;
&quot;But you wouldn't go behind his back either, would you?&quot; nalini responded.
&quot;Nah, but if we ever split up...&quot; she left it dangling suggestively, a big grin plastered across her face.
&quot;You guys are weird!&quot; Liz exclaimed.
&quot;Tell you something else that's weird&quot; paula responded, grinning widely. &quot;Ever since it happened, nalini finds me sexually attractive!&quot;
The expression on liz's face was precious. &quot;I don't think I want to know!&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;Paula is overstating the case. I've never had a lesbian experience, unlike paula. She finds me sexually attractive!&quot;
Paula shrugged. &quot;I'm not going to deny it. I enjoyed it at the time, but I prefer guys. I can also enjoy two girls and a guy, with the right couple.&quot; She looked right at the two of us, with her little miss innocent expression, defying liz to pass some remark.
Nalini continued &quot;There is a bond that formed between the three of us. But a manage a trois isn't acceptible to any of us, including paula. Could you imagine trying to explain that to your parents, paula?&quot;
&quot;Hell no, they'd die of embarrassment. So would I. I want to be respectably married eventually.&quot;
&quot;Liz, have we shocked you?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Ummm, maybe a little. Are you sure it's safe for me to be in the same house as you guys?&quot;
&quot;Sure. Nalini and I aren't into treesomes, and even if we were, we'd always respect your wishes. Just don't get offended if I don't make a pass at you!&quot;
&quot;Erm, I'd be relieved actually.&quot;
We ate our breakfast, and the conversation turned to other things. We sat talking for a while to allow our breakfast to digest. Liz agreed to accompany us to the training grounds to watch us and rupert train.
Finally we collected the cavaliers and rupert. &quot;We're going to change into some training clothes. If you want to participate, ask the servents to get you some as well.&quot;
The three of us returned to our suite, and I presented liz with two large boxes of condoms. &quot;Jeez! How many do you think I need?&quot;
&quot;Liz, it saves you having to ask us for more. You have our blessing, it's up to you now. Only sleep with him if you're comfortable with it. Otherwise don't, okay?&quot;
She nodded. &quot;Okay, thanks. I get butterflies when I think about it.&quot; She was turning something over in her mind. I waited. Finally she blurted out &quot;Was nalini serious about having you ... train... me like paula?&quot;
&quot;Yes, but only if it's necessary. You'd have to find me sexually attractive, or it just wouldn't work. You'd have to be comfortable with it, have to want it to happen.&quot; I smiled &quot;You're not exactly throwing yourself at me, are you? Don't even think about it liz, it ain't gonna happen, and I won't be starting anything.&quot;
She suddenly straightened, and looked me in the eye. &quot;Well, if nalini wasn't on the scene, I mean if you were single, I could probably go for you.&quot; Then she snorted &quot;Huh! I'd probably have to fight paula then! I never really found white guys attractive, but you're not like others. I'd rather we left it at friends, I think we can be great friends, and I'm not sure I can handle it if you and I did have sex while you're with nalini.&quot;
&quot;That's cool, I prefer it that way myself. But hey, if I were single, I'd prefer you to paula, so you wouldn't have to fight her.&quot;
She smiled. &quot;Thanks danny. I appreciate that.&quot; She touched my arm. &quot;Now do you wanna leave while I get changed?&quot;
I thought of a smart comment, but refrained from making it. &quot;Give us a yell when you're ready.&quot;
Nalini and I talked about what happened while we changed, but there wasn't much to say. We'd both prefer to leave things as friends, and avoid any further complications to our lives. So much for quietly getting married and living happily ever after while sliding into old age.
When liz walked out into our sitting area, we were already there in our lycra, preparing to fetch some stuff from home. Nalini and I were linked, and picturing our training gear, packed in bags where we'd left it. There was a sense of something extending out, followed some moments later by a sense of contact, and then we pulled back, much like reeling in a fish. Two bags of sporting gear suddenly appeared on the floor in front of us.
&quot;Hey cool! Where'd that come from?&quot; Liz was wearing red and purple lycra tights and a blue and green body suit. Maybe not quite color coordinated, but you could certainly see where she was. Nalini was wearing something similar, but in dark blue and green. I was the odd one out in black bicycle shorts and a t-shirt.
&quot;Home. This is ours. We didn't want to lug it all the way here.&quot; We unpacked our fencing gear, along with two blunted but otherwise real samurai swords. &quot;Shall we go?&quot; Nalini draped the jacket around her body, partially obscuring things.
&quot;Actually, I might just grab a t-shirt.&quot;
We entered the sitting room, where a similarly dressed paula was talking with rupert. Rupert was wearing what had to be padded fencing gear, presumably provided by the servants. There was a mask and training sword beside him.
His eyes travelled up and down nalini, then up and down liz. Nalini said &quot;Hey, we're decent, everything's covered.&quot;
He coughed discretely and lowered his eyes.
Paula added &quot;Yeah rupert, if you're embarrassed, don't look.&quot;
&quot;You girls are certainly different from the ones back home.&quot; He spied the swords we carried. &quot;Do you girls fence as well?&quot;
&quot;I do.&quot; nalini replied. &quot;Paula and liz are learning. Let's collect your friends.&quot;
Rupert fell in beside liz, I walked between nalini and paula. The other three contrived to fall in behind us, no doubt to obtain a better look at the girls' legs.
As we walked, I explained. &quot;This is actually the king's private training arena, but it is also available to any guests at the palace. He works out here every day. He also invites a selection of soldiers from the army to work out with him.&quot;
&quot;Why?&quot; tobias asked.
&quot;It seems to promote loyalty. They put their names down, and lots are drawn to choose who goes on a particular day. They get to trade blows with the king, he yells at them if they pull any punches, normally he beats six or eight of them together, then they all have a drink with their king, get to share his bath, and have a feast for lunch. It's very popular with the soldiers.&quot;
&quot;It's a bit unusual isn't it?&quot; tobias asked.
&quot;King amrik is an unusual man. His nickname is the Bull.&quot;
We rounded a corner into the open, and we could hear amrik bellowing &quot;Come on men! I expect you to hit hard! Surely five of you can defeat me!&quot;
Ahead was the wooden building that was the king's dojo. Today, being a fine spring day, the shutters on the walls had been removed, leaving only the pillars supporting the roof. In one corner was a complete set of gym equipment, where amrik worked out with weights. On the other side, a number of courtiers dresses in fencing gear were training, although right now most had stopped to watch the king. In center stage was amrik, dressed only in a loin cloth. He had the corded muscles of a professional body builder, coupled with a dancer's lythe grace. He was armed with a wooden sword, dancing and weaving among five figures similarly armed. Compared to him they looked puny, and try as they might, they could not touch him.
Suddenly he moved like a panther, whacking three of them hard enough to cause them to sit down abruptly. The fourth threw all caution to the winds, not trying to block, and smacked the king a buffet in the ear just as the king's own wooden sword hit him in the guts. The king roared defiantly, kicked the legs from under his fifth assailant, and made a chopping motion at his head as he fell. Then he stretched out his hand to the one who had hit him, hauling him to his feet. &quot;Hah! Well done bono!&quot; He clapped him on the shoulder, then hugged him. &quot;A man after my own heart! You've earned a gold piece for that!&quot; He didn't seem to be breathing heavily.
He spied our group, and called out &quot;Welcome! Danny, nalini, will you fence with me later?&quot;
&quot;Sure! Just give us a chance to warm up.&quot;
Prospero came over to us, kissed paula. &quot;I'd like to do some fencing as well.&quot;
&quot;I'm sure we can fit you in. You might like to see what the cavaliers can do as well.&quot;
&quot;Now that's a good idea.&quot; He turned to the four cavaliers. &quot;I'd like to see your style, then maybe we can have a little contest afterward.&quot;
The four of us cleared an area for our own training, and did some stretching and warming up. Once we started, we'd have a crowd of our own. I looked at us. Dressed as they were, there was little to imagine about their figures. Nalini is slim, but you can see she has muscles like a dancer. Paula is almost skinny, but she has put on muscle over the past six months. Liz by contrast is padded and rounded. Normally I consider myself muscular, but beside amrik I would look slim.
We started with the two katas that liz knows. Prospero joined us. The sight of the five of us performing the stylized movements almost in unison always draws a crowd. Then I set liz to perform some solo exercises while the four of us went through the katas that paula and prospero know. By the time that finished, all of us were sweating.
Next nalini and i watched the other three perform some movements, then I taught liz a new movement while nalini supervised the other two. Then nalini and i went on to perform six other katas. Prospero went to fence with rupert and the others. We set paula and liz some exercises to practice together.
The last three katas were performed with swords. Done properly, the swords whistle as you move. We had a crowd by now, including amrik.
&quot;There are two katas that you taught me last time. I would like to do them with you.&quot; he stated.
&quot;Please do.&quot; We performed two more katas, then stopped for a breather.
&quot;We'll teach you another kata this time around.&quot;
&quot;I'd like that. It's good to learn new techniques, otherwise the training becomes stale, and the challenge goes out of it.&quot;
Nalini and I went through the new kata once, then we went through again slowly with amrik. Part way through I stopped to set liz and paula sparring, which meant I had to watch them while nalini taught the king. Looking around, I realised our audience had grown - nearby was king charles, looking incongruous in his high heeled shoes, and to one side was cromwell with matthew and stephen.
The sparring wasn't a free for all, I kept stopping and correcting what they did, and limited the number of moves they could make. Liz has good hand eye coordination, and learns quickly. Finally I stopped them, and watched amrik. He has the moves, he picks up new katas quickly, with little need for correction. Between nalini and I, we ran through the new kata six times.
&quot;Okay, time out. Amrik, you learn very rapidly. We'll repeat that one tomorrow. Now, if you'll excuse us, nalini and I want to do some free form sparring.&quot;
&quot;Good, I'll watch!&quot; he grinned.
Free form sparring is exactly that, anything goes, except that we don't aim for the eyes, and we pull punches. It's the only time we have to quieten down our telepathic ability, otherwise we telegraph our moves to each other. When done at the black belt level, it often winds up that we circle each other for a while, then with a sudden flurry of moves someone wins.
After fifteen minutes, we took a breather, and dressed in our fencing gear. We started out one on one with amrik, but he would defeat us easily. The two of us together were good enough to defeat him. We stopped for rest, and he went on to challenge rupert, prospero, tobias, james and robert together. Unfortunately for him, he was soundly beaten. Prospero was almost good enough to hold his own against amrik. Of the cavaliers, prince rupert was by far the best, and used a slightly different style from his English companions. He and prospero defeated the king three times in a row; then he put up a spirited defence against prospero while amrik rested.
&quot;It is always good when you train with us, because otherwise it is very rare for any of them to defeat me. Prince rupert is good, he is making prospero work!&quot;
While we sat, king charles came over to us. &quot;Your majesty, I haven't fenced for some years now, but would it be possible for me to practice tomorrow?&quot;
&quot;Of course your majesty. Any king worthy of his crown should know how to use a sword, you are more than welcome. While you are here, this is your second home.&quot;
I became aware that matthew, cromwell and stephen were making remarks about the girls:
&quot;Girls should be forbidden to fight!&quot;
&quot;They are dressed like sluts!&quot;
&quot;It's absolutely disgusting, you can see everything!&quot;
Nalini suddenly stood up. &quot;Come on paula and liz, this is our honor at stake.&quot; She drew her training sword. I gave mine to paula, amrik handed his to liz. Nalini had undone her padded fencing jacket, now she removed it.
Nalini sauntered over, left hand on hip, the other holding the sword so it rested on her shoulder. Liz and paula followed behind, paula doing a passable imitation of nalini. Liz was content just to walk and hold the sword in both hands.
Nalini stopped in front of matthew, and stuck her chest out. &quot;What's the matter boys? Got a bad case of lustful thoughts?&quot; Matthew was staring at her chest, stephen at paula's crotch.
&quot;Madam!&quot; cromwell spluttered. &quot;Your attire!&quot;
Nalini's sword snaked out to caress cromwell's cheek. &quot;I've told you before, if a human body offends you, go somewhere you won't see it. And since we're made in god's image, that means you find god offensive. Think about it.&quot;
Paula's sword snaked out to catch stephen under the chin, and lever his head up. He looked scared. &quot;Hey, didn't anyone ever tell you, it's rude to stare?&quot;
Cromwell found his voice again &quot;I will never allow such attire in my england!&quot;
&quot;Your England? Isn't that the sin of pride? And shouldn't the people decide what clothing they find offensive? But this isn't your england. If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. And if you have lustful thoughts, then that's your problem, not mine.&quot;
She stepped back slightly so she could look at matthew. &quot;You like looking at my tits do you? Do they excite you? Do you get thoughts of touching them?&quot; Matthew was looking very uncomfortable, red faced, with beads of persperation on his upper lip. &quot;Hmm, I see you are all too ready to stare when you think it will not be noticed, but you have to keep up the pretence of being offended. You're a hypocrite.&quot; Nalini moved the sword to lift matthew's jerkin. &quot;Oh my, I've embarrassed the poor boy. He's lost his erection.&quot;
By now there were titters amongs the watchers. Amrik, who had been scowling at the remarks was trying not to laugh at their discomfort. Even king charles was looking amused.
Nalini turned to stephen. He was watching her like a snake. &quot;Paula's crotch excites you does it? Do you get the urge to reach out and touch it? Or maybe you'd like to get close enough to sniff? She's been working out you know, she's all sweaty, lots of nice odours for you.&quot;
Cromwell looked like he was about to explode. &quot;Madame, control yourself!&quot; he snapped.
&quot;You control yourself! Don't stare, and don't pass remarks!&quot;
He controlled himself, and turned away, closing his eyes and putting his hands over his ears.
&quot;Stephen, you're another hypocrite, pretending to be offended when all you really want to do is have a good look.&quot; Nalini used her sword again to move stephen's jacket aside and reveal his crotch area. &quot;Oh dear, we've embarrassed him too, and he's lost his erection.&quot;
She reached out and tapped cromwell on the shoulder. &quot;Hey cromwell, turn around please, I'm speaking to you.&quot; Her translation spell was active, so it wouldn't matter if he stoppered his ears, he would still hear what she said. &quot;Now boys, this is just a little lesson in manners. It's rude to stare, and it's rude to pass remarks. If god's handiwork offends you, you're sad cases. Remember, 'If thine eye offend thee, then pluck it out'. and also 'Remove the log from your own eye before attempting to remove the spec from someone else's'. Now, before you go, you boys are going to control your lustful thoughts, and each of you will appologise for your rudeness.&quot;
Cromwell looked as if he could strangle someone, but he held himself in check. &quot;As far as we are concerned, your attire and your behaviour is entirely unsuitable. I will not appologise.&quot; he stated icily.
&quot;Then you'd better leave. But don't forget that pride comes before a fall.&quot;
He turned on his heel. &quot;Come matthew, stephen, let us leave this god forsaken place.&quot; He walked a couple of paces, and waited for the others.
&quot;No, not you two. You were even ruder than he was. So you two can appologise before you leave. Matthew, you were staring at my tits. Appologise now!&quot;
Matthew was red in the face. He stammered and stuttered, but finally managed &quot;I.. I... appologise lady. I should not have stared.&quot;
&quot;Appology accepted, don't do it again. And I appologise for embarrassing you. Now please go and tell cromwell he's in the wrong, and I expect him to appologise. Stephen! Don't slink off like that. You were staring at paula's crotch, you owe her an appology. Speak up, we can't hear you.&quot;
He stammered an appology, and fled. Nalini turned to paula. &quot;Thanks girls.&quot; She turned to the crowd. &quot;We don't mind guys admiring, but we find sanctimonious hypocrites like them offensive, they watch but pretend they don't, and then they condemn us for our clothes.&quot;
In the world where honor is important, you have to defend it publicly. Prospero had just reminded me of that, because he was heading rapidly towards us. I stood and bellowed &quot;CROMWELL! You have insulted my wife, and you have insulted me! By rights I can challenge you to a duel, but we both know you would die! Are you prepared to die to back up your allegations?&quot;
&quot;Shit! I should have challenged him myself!&quot; nalini exclaimed.
&lt;&lt;It would probably be bad form here. A man is supposed to duel for his wife's honor, not the other way around.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I hope it wasn't bad form for me to get up and confront him then.&gt;&gt;.
&lt;&lt;I think you did the right thing. I should only have to stand up for you when they defy you.&gt;&gt;.
Cromwell turned round. Like me, he had very little choice. &quot;Would you commit murder?&quot; he called back.
I pitched my voice to carry, no longer shouting. I wasn't going to walk towards him. &quot;You started it. You called my wife a slut, and in public. Now you have a choice. Prove it or retract it.&quot; I put on my samurai stare, with the corners of my mouth turned down, my eyes narrowed, nostrils flaired.
&quot;And if I turn my back and walk away?&quot;
&quot;Then unfortunately for you, you will die. It would not be murder, but suicide. As far as the public will be concerned, you chose to appologise by dying.&quot; Would I kill him? I'd feel bad that it happened, but if he was stiff necked enough not to appologise, then in this society, there was little scope for not killing him. Mind you, I could run rings around him, so it might be acceptable to humiliate him by cutting his clothes off bit by bit until he stood there naked but for his socks. He would probably stand there, refuse to pick up a sword, which could be a way out - if he refused to fight, he'd be a coward, and he'd be deemed to have appologised.
He walked slowly back toward me, staring into my eyes. I stared back. I had to give him credit, he didn't appear to be afraid. &quot;The great cromwell, would be leader of men. One who betrays his principles by telling lies. You're out of line, and you know it. Now appologize, unless your pride prevents you.&quot; I kept my voice level, outwardly I appeared calm, but my heart was beating faster.
He didn't look around, he still looked directly into my eyes. I stared back unblinkingly. Then he lowered his eyes. He took a deep breath, then spoke loudly, pitching his voice to carry. &quot;I unreservedly withdraw my remarks about your lady wife. I spoke in the heat of the moment. I humbly beg your forgiveness for my loutish behaviour.&quot;
&quot;Very well, I accept your appololgy. Now you should also appologise to the princess nalini, the lady paula and the lady elizabeth.&quot; Nalini walked forward to join me. Cromwell repeated his appology to her. I called liz over, and cromwell appologized to her.
Paula was no longer my responsibility, but prospero's, so I had to make this look good for him. &quot;Prospero, are you happy to accept cromwell's appology to the lady paula, or would you challenge him yourself?&quot;
Prospero was standing beside amrik and charles. &quot;You've saved me the bother, after all, we can only kill him once.&quot; So paula came forward to accept cromwell's appology. That business finally over, cromwell turned on his heel, collected his two companions, and walked rapidly away.
We returned to sit with amrik, charles and prospero. &quot;I've probably ruined things for prospero now.&quot; nalini stated. &quot;Do any of you think there was a better way to handle that?&quot;
&quot;Nah&quot; I replied. &quot;You embarrassed them, they'll think very hard before they try that again. The other two appologised, so they know they were guilty. But I'm not sure if it's socially acceptable for you to challenge cromwell to a duel.&quot;
Amrik said &quot;It's fine by me. He insulted you nalini, it's your right to challenge him. You're a warrior.&quot;
Prospero shook his head. &quot;There is nothing wrong about a woman standing up for her honor, but challenging cromwell to a duel might be overstepping the bounds a little. I don't mean any offence nalini. You did the right thing by insisting he appologise, and danny did the right thing by challenging him when he refused. I'm just glad that you saved me from having to challenge him.&quot;
Charles smiled. &quot;It gladdens my heart to see them discomforted so. Cromwell is more stiff necked than the others though, I did not think he would appologise.&quot;
Amrik clapped charles on the shoulder, causing him to stagger a little. &quot;You hoped it would come to a duel, and cromwell be killed! 'Twould save you some trouble, hey?&quot;
Charles smiled. &quot;It would be convenient, I must admit. But even with Cromwell out of the way, 'twill be not easy to accomplish the restoration.&quot;
&quot;Nay, as prospero says, we need cromwell to be alive, and publicly recant his doings.&quot;
&quot;He is a stiff necked man, he will not recant. To him it be his religious duty as a puritan.&quot;
&quot;Well, prospero is good at getting things to change. Speaking of which, I need to change out of my sweaty clothes and bathe.&quot; He stood back, inflated his chest and bellowed &quot;All right everyone, fun's over! Go and bathe, lunch will be served in about an hour in the marqui.&quot; He turned back to charles. &quot;If you will excuse me?&quot;
Charles smiled and inclined his head. &quot;Certainly.&quot;
Amrik collected his soldiers and they headed toward the bathhouse. Most of the others followed. Rupert asked &quot;Where are they all going?&quot;
Prospero replied &quot;The king has a luxurious bath house yonder. It has hot baths, tepid baths, cold baths, a steam room and a massage room. We all need to bathe after our exercise, most will do so with the king.&quot;
&quot;Even the soldiers?&quot; Charles asked.
&quot;Certainly. It is an honor for them to share the king's bath. After they will feast with him.&quot;
&quot;Meseems it be an odd manner of being king.&quot; Charles observed.
&quot;True, but he is a fighting man who spent time in the ranks. All the soldiers adore him.&quot; Prospero started walking toward the palace. The rest of us followed him.
&quot;What would happen should one injure him during their fights?&quot;
&quot;Why nothing. He will have a thick ear from today's bout, the soldier who gave him that will earn a gold piece for his efforts. As you saw, he is the best swordsman in the army, quite possibly the best in the whole of Aquilonia. He chafes at wearing the crown though.
&quot;In fact, often in the past he would slip out of the palace in the evening, and down to one of the taverns the soldiers frequent, and spend the evening drinking with them. He does not do that much these days, but he says the men will respect a commander who can beat them in a fight and then drink them under the table. I would never have believed it, had I not seen it with my own eyes. The men would follow him to the gates of hell itself!&quot; I could see the hero worship shining in prospero's eyes.
&quot;Prospero, you would follow him too, would you not?&quot;
&quot;True danny. We fought together during the civil war, he is my best friend as well as my king. And to be honest, I am glad I persuaded him to accept the crown, he does a much better job than I could.&quot;
&quot;You made him king?&quot; Charles seemed disbelieving.
&quot;At the end of the civil war, there were several of us who had claim to the throne.&quot; prospero explained. &quot;My father was cousin to the deposed king. The king had no living issue, he had killed all his children, all his brothers and sisters and their children, and as many of his other relatives as he could. My father the old duke was then next in line to the throne, but he died during the campaign. There were others more remotely related, but where they would have supported my father, they would not support me, and we faced further civil war to choose the next king. None of the other claimants would have made a good king, though I daresay they would say the same of me. The army were all loyal to amrik, and he has a knack of inspiring people to follow him. I persuaded him to accept the crown, and that stopped further civil war. The other claimants saw the wisdom of supporting amrik, where they would not support their enemies. I suspect they thought him but a simple soldier, and that they could manipulate him. Whereas he has proved to be a canny and able king, quite the best we have ever had.&quot;
&quot;Why then does he seek to curb the king's powers with the parliament?&quot;
&quot;We have seen firsthand the evil that despots do, we have in our history seen wastrels and simpletons take the throne, their only qualification that their father wore the crown. We believe there is a better way, we have studied parliamentary democracy in a number of separate realms, including whence danny and nalini come. A king is just a man, like any other, he does not have a direct line to god in heaven.&quot;
&quot;Then you do not subscribe to the view that a king is god's representative on earth?&quot;
&quot;No, I do not. That leads to the people worshipping the king as a god, and the king believing he can do no wrong. That means bad government, and then the people suffer. A man is king only because the army and the nobles support him. Once he loses that support, he can no longer remain king. You yourself have had the misfortune to discover this. However, the idea of a king is so entrenched in people's minds that they have made cromwell king in all but name.&quot;
&quot;Then you think there is a chance a restoration?&quot;
&quot;I do. With cromwell out of the way, there will be a power vaccuum, and people will want a king to fill that vaccuum. We must engineer that cromwell go, without resorting to killing him. He has already agreed to dismantle the terror when he returns. Cromwell must publicly abdicate, and announce the restoration, otherwise there will be a prolonged civil war.&quot;
&quot;I would have him tried for treason, and executed, along with his cronies.&quot; Charles was vehement.
&quot;That would make a martyr of him.&quot; I replied. &quot;If anything, his support would increase, and people would begin to treat him like a saint. He does not fear death, he would use his death as a position statement, and you would never be rid of him. He has to recant publicly, and the key to that is his religious ferver.&quot;
Charles looked at me. &quot;I see wheels within wheels. Had you killed him in a duel, his supporters would claim that I had had him murdered, and would continue the fight. Yes, I begin to like the idea of him recanting more and more. He would be publicly humiliated, his supporters would lose their fervor.&quot;
I don't claim to be politicly adept, certainly not in the modern politics, but I began to realize that a modern education and modern communications really do broaden the mind. Charles wasn't stupid, but it seemed that many of the concepts we mentioned were not very familiar to him. To him we must have seemed machiavellian.
As we passed the breakfast room, enyil emerged from inside, and came up to us. &quot;Ah, your majesty! Would you care to take a walk around the gardens with me, or possibly some refreshments? Lunch will not be for another hour.&quot;
He beamed at her. &quot;How fortunate! I was about to lose my companions, they must bathe and change. I think I should like some tea, and then a pleasant stroll around the gardens.&quot;
We left them, and headed off to our apartments. Prospero commented to me &quot;I've asked that someone always be with charles, and someone always with cromwell. We must not allow them to feel unwelcome, and we must not allow them to have too much time by themselves.&quot;
I nodded &quot;Yes, keep them slightly off balance, that way they are more maleable. Give them time to think and they might decide to be more stubborn. You'll probably find that works more easily with charles he's a noble, and you know how to treat visiting nobles.&quot;
&quot;I think you're right there. Cromwell and the others do not approve of many things. It's sad really, to be so poor in joy of life.&quot;
&quot;They are human though, so a risky strategy would be to divide them from each other, take them individually on tours and the like, and tempt them into enjoying themselves. If that doesn't work, then take them on individual religious retreats. Cut them out of the process.&quot;
&quot;I plan to cut all of them out of the negotiation process, although if king charles wants supporters there we will have to include an equal number of cromwell's supporters.&quot;
&quot;Maybe the initial meeting should be just charles and cromwell, and introduce others for the talks?&quot;
&quot;That is my thought. Part of the problem with introducing others is that cromwell has his cronies and advisers with him, charles does not. But then he ruled as a despot, he may not have close advisers or friends.&quot;
We had reached our apartment. Tobias, Robert and James headed into their rooms, the rest of us entered into the suite of apartments we shared with prospero. Prospero turned to the rest of us and announced &quot;I invite all of you to share the main bathroom. Prince Rupert, I realize you might be embarrassed to bathe with others, if you prefer to use the bathroom in your chambers, please do so.&quot;
Rupert looked hesitant. &quot;You have told me that communal bathing is the norm here. Do men and women bathe together?&quot;
&quot;Usually. We five will do so.&quot;
&quot;And none of you will be embarrassed?&quot;
&quot;I do not think so.&quot;
Paula added &quot;I was at first, because we don't do that where I come from, but you get used to us. Once you've seen a naked body, you get used to it.&quot;
Liz added &quot;When in rome, do as the romans do.&quot;
Rupert smiled wanly. &quot;I believe I will be somewhat embarrassed, but if I am invited, I think I should.&quot;
And so we were six in prospero's main bath. It was a good deal larger than the one we shared with liz, probably closer to the size of many people's backyard swimming pool. There was also a smaller bath, probably the size of a typical spa bath, filled with tepid water. The idea was that you cleaned yourself first, then soaked in the hot water, then when that became too much, you moved to the cooler pool. Rupert and Liz managed to wash and enter the hot tub without becoming too embarrassed. Once in the hot tub, the water hides some detail, and it is easier to sit there without being embarrassed.
While we soaked, Prospero explained &quot;We are thinking of remodeling this. I would like to include a steam room...&quot;
&quot;The word's sauna.&quot; Paula interjected.
&quot;Thanks. We would like to have a sauna...&quot;
&quot;What's a sauna?&quot; Rupert asked. Paula and Prospero explained, then Prospero continued. &quot;We want to install a sauna, and a shower and a proper spa bath like danny and nalini have, but for the latter we need electricity, so we might settle for the sauna.&quot;
&quot;Electricity?&quot; rupert queried. &quot;What's that?&quot;
Prospero smiled &quot;We don't have it, you don't have it. Danny and the girls have it where they come from. How would you describe it, harnessed lightning perhaps?&quot; We digressed into electricity, our modern world, and that lead us in a round about way to governments. Several times we interrupted the conversation as one or more of us got out to jump into the cool plunge pool.
 As we were towelling off, I concluded &quot;We don't have all the answers rupert, but we have been through things your world has yet to try, we have a better idea about what works and what doesn't. We've been passing that onto amrik, now we would like to try to pass that onto your world. But for that to work, the rulers have to agree, we need to educate people about how it works, and of course your world will develop its own version that works for it.&quot;
Rupert wrapped the towel about his middle. He was trying not to look at the girls. &quot;I feel much happier about what you are proposing to do now. It is a compromise of sorts between what the king wants and what cromwell wants, but you have seen similar compromises work in your homeland. I should probably attend some of these discussions.&quot;
Prospero had his towel draped over his shoulder, and was quite open about looking at the girls. &quot;I would like you to attend some of the discussions, and danny, you should also attend. Today however will be a preliminary meeting, just myself, charles and cromwell. Hopefully it will establish the parameters, framework and scope of the negotiations. So you are free to sight see this afternoon.&quot;
Lunch was served in the open area near the training ground. There was a marqui set up to protect guests from the sun. We bumped into durathror, ra'anor, his sister imladril, queen of the viharani, and her consort iskandor. They were undoubtedly on the lookout for us, but since we are all vegetarians, it stood to reason we would be congregated at the vegetarian end of the food.
You could see the family resemblance between durathror and imladril, she has the same coppery skin, blonde hair arranged in about fifty beaded braids, and leaf green eyes, but is tinier again, being only four foot nine inches tall, with the small bone structure to match. She looks about sixteen, but is over eight hundred years old, which makes her about four hundred years younger than her brother.
After we greeted each other, nalini and I helped ourselves to the food, and then sat down at their table, where they had saved us seats. Imladril remarked &quot;You should pay us a visit, your dog would love to see you.&quot;
&quot;We were going to come by later today. We only got in last night. I think we will have to find other lodgings, I don't know if prospero wants a dog in his apartment.&quot;
Imladril smiled. &quot;You should stay with us, but we'd have to put you up on the floor. Rhiannon is happy, but she would be happier if you were around.&quot;
Iskandor added &quot;You might find it preferable to stay where you are for now though, durathror and ra'anor have told us about your guests.&quot;
Imladril added &quot;How do you rate your chances of stopping the civil war?&quot;
&quot;Oh, we're quietly confident.&quot; nalini replied. &quot;Cromwell has had to admit his reasons were flawed. He just needs some more work to come round.&quot;
&quot;It's not just the civil war though.&quot; I added. &quot;There's the terror, the witch persecutions and the religious fanatacism. That also makes the puritans risky because they might decide we are pagans, and refuse to have anything to do with us.&quot;
The others nodded. Imladril replied &quot;When durathror briefed us, I thought that their religious fanaticism would be the hardest thing to overcome. But he seems to feel that you and he have turned their fanaticism in a different direction.&quot;
Durathror wiped his hands on a napkin, nodding. &quot;If we try to cure their fanaticism, we would severely alter their personalities, and they would revert later. But what danny and nalini started is to use their fanaticism and direct it against their former actions. Properly harnessed, I think it will work well. Convince them they are miserable sinners, and they will try to do good works to atone for their sins.&quot;
He drank a swig of wine, wiped his moustache. His eyes were shining. &quot;Did you know I spent some years studying to be a priest? The christian faith was sweeping through many shadows, including those I was frequenting. They wanted to persecute me as a pagan and an elf, but I foiled them by asking to convert. The bishop was overjoyed when he discovered that the holy wafer did not burn me, because to him it meant I had a soul to save. And so I spent several years studying their faith. Like all great faiths, it has much to recommend it, but also much to condemn it. But it means I have an understanding of cromwell's fanaticism.&quot;
Nalini nodded, her mouth full of food. I was about to attempt swallowing quickly when I remembered that they were telepathic, even though durathror had been speaking english. Iskandor and Imladril do not speak english. I replied &lt;&lt;I realized you had studied christianity when you called the jesus figure various terms for satan. It was a masterful stroke, cromwell hasn't been his usual confident self this morning.&gt;&gt;.
Nalini added &lt;&lt;Yes, at training this morning you could see he was angry, and in turmoil. I think that's why he let things get to a point where danny had to challenge him before he appologized for his remarks.&gt;&gt;.
They didn't know that story, so we told it. After that we talked about many things over the course of a leisurely lunch. The vegetarian part of the lunch consisted mostly of what I would classify as middle eastern delicacies, plus cheeses, fruit pies and fresh fruit followed by coffee. The meat eaters were treated to a spit roast of a large animal like a cow, several casseroles of meat or fish, including one that looked and smelled like a curry, a selection of meat pies, baked fish, the list went on. It may not have been quite up to the quality of French haut cuisine, but there was a wide variety, plenty of it and I'm told it was tasty. There was also copious quantities of wine and beer.
We were still lingering over coffee and a sweet wine when prospero and paula walked over. He was appologetic. &quot;You pardon, your majesty, I am remiss on my duties. I should have paid my respects to you much earlier!&quot;
Imladril laughed. &quot;Cut the formalities prospero! I am just Imladril. I know you are busy with proud nobles who will have their noses out of joint if you visit them in the wrong order, plus another king to pander to.&quot;
A servant dragged two chairs over for them to sit down at out table. &quot;Oh, king Charles is no bother. He knows he owes us his life, and is a guest here. We treat him politely, amuse him like any other important noble, and he is happy. Plus he also knows we are working on how to have him restored to the throne without further bloodshed. Those cursed puritans are the bane of my life. They don't like this, they don't like that, the food is too spicey, or too foreign, they complain that the whole kingdom has loose morals and they refuse to bathe or change their underwear!&quot;
&quot;Does that include cromwell?&quot; I asked.
&quot;No, he is being more reasonable, especially since you forced him to appoligize this morning. He has the intelligence to be a ruler, he is behaving himself. What ever happened to him last night has disquietened him. My spies tell me he spent this morning studying his bible, and again after his humiliation he returned to his room, dismissed his companions, and began reading his bible. I am unsure whether that is a god sign or a bad sign.&quot; He stopped to pour himself some coffee, waving away the servant.
&quot;You might refill this pot of coffee though.&quot; The servant nodded and departed. Prospero continued &quot;The others are either self important petty nobles or money grubbing merchants who think they are too good for the likes of us. Stephen has been overheard calling nalini and paula jezza something, I take it is some term of opprobium.&quot;
&quot;Jezabel. She was a whore in one of the chapters of the bible.&quot;
Prospero's lips thinned. &quot;If he says that in my hearing, I will call him out!&quot;
Imladril commented &quot;Keep them under observation prospero, but do nothing rash yet.&quot;
&quot;What is this about bathing?&quot; ra'anor asked. &quot;Do they behave like savages, wearing the same clothing until it rots?&quot;
&quot;Cromwell did bathe last night, and he put on clean underclothing this morning. I think he has taken nalini's advice about cleanliness and godliness. King charles had a bath last night, and washed himself this morning. He had clean clothes last night, and again this morning. After his walk in the garden with enyil, he gave all his soiled clothes to the servants, insisted on clean clothes being brought for lunch. If anything, he will cause problems if we cannot provide him with a large wardrobe. Tobias, James and Robert did not wash themselves this morning, but they did bathe after their exercises. I think they will bathe regularly if we remind them. Rupert is quite clean so far.&quot;
Nalini remarked &quot;Germans have a reputation for being clean, whereas the English have a reputation for bathing once a week, whether they need it or not.&quot;
Prospero pulled a face. &quot;I think if they do not bathe for a week, amrik will throw them out of the palace, and put them into the stables!&quot;
Imladril advised &quot;Keep them under observation today. Any who refuse to bathe tonight or tomorrow morning, or who put their dirty underclothing back on, should be publicly humiliated by being forcibly stripped and bathed in public. Cromwell I would warn first though.&quot;
&quot;Say! I like that idea! We could take them to the large public bathes, or maybe to the horse exercise yard, where they can be thrown into the pond the horses use.&quot;
Imladril added &quot;You should probably have amrik pass judgement on them, so they do not feel unfairly singled out.&quot;
&quot;Oh of course my lady. It will be done legally. I am looking forward to this!&quot;
Iskandor asked &quot;What are your plans for this afternoon?&quot;
&quot;Well, in about an hour or so, king charles, king amrik, lord oliver, the lady enyil and myself will meet for preliminary discussions. This will set the parameters and scope of the negotiations for the days that follow. Subsequently I shall meet with charles and oliver. I might invite other people, including danny and nalini, and enyil and amrik might drop in from time to time.&quot;
Iskandor nodded &quot;I might like to attend some of these meetings. Especially if some of the puritans will be invited. I think you will need us to keep an eye on them.&quot;
&quot;By all means. All of you here are welcome to attend at any time.&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;I would like to listen in on the preliminary meeting today. After that I will decide whether to attend other sessions. But most of this is yours prospero, we cannot do the work for you.&quot;
Prospero replied &quot;My lady, you are most welcome to attend today. I realize I will be the facilitator, but others may help sway the opinions and attitudes of the protagonists.&quot;
Iskandor replied &quot;Then I would come too, if I may.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;You are welcome too, my lord.&quot;
Paula shook her head. &quot;No way am I going! I was going to show liz and rupert around tarantia.&quot;
Prospero smiled &quot;I am glad of that, my sweet. I know you would be bored with negotiations, most women would be. And really I would prefer to have people attend who are experienced in government.&quot;
 A little later, Liz and rupert wandered over. Prospero performed the introductions. &quot;This is her royal highness Imladril, queen of the viharani, and her consort baron Iskandor. I believe you have already met her brother prince Durathror, and his consort the lady Ra'anor. This is prince Rupert of the Rhine, commander of king Charles' army.&quot;
&quot;There's hardly any army left.&quot; rupert murmered.
&quot;But you have performed valiantly against overwhelming odds.&quot; Imladril replied. They chatted politely for a few minutes. Then Imladril asked &quot;I have heard that you have been performing some dreaming practices. Do you recall much of them?&quot;
&quot;Your majesty, I remember looking at strange shapes, but I do vividly recall visiting an area that at first I thought was heaven, along with some of these others. We discovered the puritans there praying, and then durathror discomforted them by revealing that the figure of jesus was in fact satan. Then we went to a garden where there was food and drink. It all was as vivid as we are here today. I have never experienced a dream before like that.&quot;
Imladril smiled as she replied &quot;As your power grows, it will be easier to recall your dreams, and easier to have dreams where you are aware you are dreaming. Liz is learning this at present. Would you learn more of this yourself?&quot;
He flashed a quick smile. &quot;Your majesty, there is nothing evil in this is there?&quot;
Imladril shook her head, her beads clattering lightly. &quot;It is no more evil than walking or running.&quot;
&quot;Then your majesty, I should like to learn more of this.&quot;
Imladril nodded. &quot;Then prince rupert, I will lay a task upon you. In your dreams, seek out one of us. It does not matter which one of us, but each night, try to find one of us. I know it sounds simple, but it is not as easy as it sounds. However, it will become easier with practice. This is but the first step on a long road to knowledge, you will learn more as time goes by. I can promise nothing, because you must learn at your own pace. A little guidence also - drink only in moderation, never become drunk, nor should you use strong drugs, except for medical purposes. They cloud your faculties, and impair your powers.&quot;
&quot;Thank you, your majesty, I shall do my best.&quot;
Then paula announced &quot;Okay guys, who wants to go sight seeing? I'd like to go soon so there is still time.&quot;
That wound up being myself and nalini, plus durathror and ra'anor. We left prospero talking with Imladril and Iskandor.
 To my eyes, Prospero's shadow is a curious mix of styles. The clothing reminds me of Europe in the mid eighteen hundreds, the architecture reminds me of the late seventeen hundreds, the technology dates from various eras. The richer people have indoor plumbing with hot and cold water on tap, flushing toilets, like the early nineteen hundreds, yet gunpowder has not been invented. The poorer people don't have plumbing, but can obtain their water from taps situated in many streets, and can take advantage of sophisticated public bathhouses like the Romans had. There is even a law on the statute books requiring that everyone bathe daily. It is an old one, but I presume some civic minded king had decided to clean up his city, probably the same one who had had the aqueducts built.
 The steam engine has been invented, but is still emerging from the experimental stage. Prospero is leading the push to develop practical uses for it, and had plans to get together with prince rupert later in the week to discuss the use of steam engines in his shadow. He has also studied our own history, so he is trying to avoid the 'dark satanic mills' of our industrial revolution. Sailing ships exist, but are not as sophisticated as those of Europe of the sixteenth century. Some kingdoms still use oar-powered galleys, but Aquilonia has a well-developed navy. Prospero is attempting to introduce steam power to the Aquilonian navy.
Aquilonia is one of the bigger empires of his shadow. It extends north to the ocean (known as the Great Sea), and south to the Central Sea. It is roughly the size of Spain, France and half of Germany, and is situated on the north east arc of the Central Sea. There are a number of empires and kingdoms situated around the Central Sea, which is probably a half as large again as the Mediterranean. However, unlike the Mediterranean, there are no deserts to the south, instead the southern countries are tropical or semi tropical, with lush vegetation. The Central Sea is open in the northwest and east to the Great Sea, and in the south to the Lesser Sea. A number of land masses extend outwards from the Central Sea, to the north they disappear into the cold Great Ocean, while in the south they extend all the way to the Great Southern Ice. No one knows whether there is land inside the ice shelf. There are more land masses to the east and west, but not all of them have been explored.
Aquilonia is also an ancient empire, with traditions extending back almost fifteen hundred years. In recent times it had been cursed with a series of incompetent or evil kings, and the empire has shrunk on account of depredations from the surrounding countries. Under Sorono and then Amrik, the shrinkage has stopped. The empire trades with many others around the central sea, and is quite wealthy. By the standards of this shadow, its army and navy are large, modern and well disciplined. Even Prospero admits that evil king Sorono ran a disciplined army and navy. The military are professionals, are well paid and well trained.
There are no slaves in Aquilonia, although some of its trading partners run slave economies. However, the economy still runs largely on human and animal power, although wind and water power are also used. With the advent of steam, that will undoubtedly change over the next fifty to one hundred years.
The official religion of Aquilonia is the worship of Mithras, the sun god. It is fairly tolerant and enlightened, unlike the religions of some of its trading partners. The culture is reasonably enlightened, many of the citizens are educated enough to be able to read and write. If anything, tolerance of differences gained a new lease of life following the fall of Sorono. If you have money, it is quite a pleasant place to live. However, it is not idyllic - there is no social security except for the military - soldiers and sailors retire with a pension, as do wounded ones, or their families if they die. Amrik has introduced a similar scheme for the public service, but for most people the reality is that if you can't work, your family must support you. Failing that, you beg, starve, or become a thief. Sounds like many places back home.
Tarantia is the capital of Aquilonia. It is situated like Rome on seven hills on the northern and western bank of the Tarantella River, near the mouth. It is a port city. People claim the river is safe to drink, the city is situated far enough back from the sea so that the water is still fresh, and the river teams with fish. However, the city water comes from the mountains fifty miles to the east, conveyed from there on four huge aqueducts. The mountains themselves are extinct volcanoes, the tallest has permanent snow cover. There is a huge crater lake from which the city water is drawn, this lake is fed both by melting snows and underground springs. The aqueducts are engineering marvels standing many hundreds of meters above ground, high enough that the water can be conveyed to the palace cisterns on the hill. Three of the city's hills are also extinct volcanoes, and their craters are used as holding dams for the water from the aqueducts.
The castle is on a low hill overlooking the docks. It is the oldest building in the city, and once boasted a huge wall. The castle has been extended many times, and now has a number of different architecture styles. Most of the old wall has been reused for building material, and what is left of the wall now surrounds the castle garden. The old basalt and granite has been white washed, covered with stucco, or plastered and painted. Most of it is white, with roman style arches and colonnades, but other areas have small high arrow slits. Newer parts have been built with bricks or pink sandstone cut from some cliffs upstream. There are four square, whitewashed towers with green copper pyramidal roofs. Once they stood at the four corners of the castle walls, but now the castle extends beyond them, and they are accompanied by a round spire with a domed cupola of green copper. Most of the older part of the castle is roofed with gray slate, while most of the new part is roofed with red tile.
Around the hill are the larger houses belonging to some of the nobles. Every noble has a country estate somewhere outside Tarantia, but many have a mansion with expansive grounds situated in Tarantia. Others are along the north shore, overlooking the wide bay where many ships can anchor, while others are along the south and eastern banks of the river. Those on the further bank entail a ferry ride to reach the city, so they tend to belong to those nobles who do not frequent the city proper or the court.
There is also a small spring that bubbles up inside the castle walls, which could have been used in times of siege, but this is not sufficient to supply enough drinking water for the palace staff, let alone the fountains or water the extensive gardens that are there now.
Below the large houses of the nobility stretch streets of shops, smaller houses of the middle classes, and houses of some of the more famous artisans. This is the old city, which has its own wall almost three meters high. The old city extends around the hill, and down to the dock, where the thieves quarters are, mixed in with mean hovels and fortified warehouses, and out around the other six hills. Once the wall was meant to defend the city, but now buildings built up to and sometimes over the wall. The gates still stand, but they are always open. On the outside of the walls are the meaner dwellings of the poorer people, some large houses in secluded areas, and the general overflow of the city.
Around the better areas, the streets are wide and paved, there are squares with fountains, floral gardens and statues. Most of the buildings are white stone or white washed brick, many with red terracotta tile roofs. Some of the more expensive ones have green copper roofs, while older or poorer buildings have slate roofs. An army of street sweepers is employed to keep the streets reasonably clean. The fact that horses are the main transport means that there is tons of horse shit on the streets that has to be cleaned daily. The same king who introduced the bathing law addressed some of this by banning horses from many of the streets, and banning people from dropping litter. These bans are still in force.
 We walked through many of the main thoroughfares, stopping to admire the view, the architecture, the people, and the wares in the shops. Paula knew her way better than the rest of us, and did seem to know something about who the statues were. We stopped several times at pavement cafes for refreshments. The sun was heading down by the time we returned to the palace.
When we arrived in our apartment, we found the servants has laid out formal clothes for us. That meant I had to wear riding boots and a ceremonial sword, while nalini had a tiara laid out for her along with an evening gown.
I should explain that an Aquilonian gentleman wears trousers, but they stop a little below the knees, similar to the trousers worn by the cavaliers and the puritans, except theirs are skin tight while ours are baggy. Outside, and on formal occasions, a gentleman wears knee high riding boots, inside he wears sandals or goes barefoot. Knee high socks are only worn with riding boots, unlike our guests, who wear similar socks with their shoes, and wear the same shoes outdoors and indoors. In Aquilonia, what ever is worn for walking outside the house is never worn inside, and vice versa. So these formal riding boots had never been worn outside, and would never touch a horse.
Ladies who ride horses usually wear similar trousers; nalini hardly ever wears a skirt here. Ladies who don't ride usually wear skirts and dresses that come just below the knee. Outdoors they will wear boots, but indoors they will wear court shoes or sandals.
&quot;What's the occasion?&quot; we asked paula.
&quot;Um.. actually, I'm not supposed to tell you, but you're the guests of honor. Amrik is giving you a presentation for saving him and Prospero...&quot; She saw our expressions and continued &quot;Look, I'll tell you, but please don't tell them you know, it's supposed to be a surprise. Danny will be formally made an earl, and you'll be formally made whatever the female equivalent is. I don't know what the English is.&quot;
&quot;Probably just lady in English. Does that mean we're being given an estate? Titles usually come with an estate.&quot;
We looked at one another. We had been talking that afternoon of purchasing a house somewhere in Tarantia, and spending more time here, especially since Paula would be spending more time here.
&quot;Hey, that's great paula. I guess we have to prepare some thank you speach?&quot;
&quot;Maybe, but they really want it to be a surprise.&quot;
&quot;Okay, we'll just stammer and stutter in thanks.&quot;
&quot;All right, last night's dinner was semi formal,&quot; Nalini remarked &quot;and I wore a suitable dress. But you know I don't like wearing dresses at the best of times. Tonight is formal honors, and danny is supposed to wear military dress. I'm a warrior just as much as danny is, so I'm going to wear trousers and a sword as well. I'll keep the tiara though.&quot;
Paula wasn't sure if she should wear military dress but that didn't stop Nalini. Our wardrobes were provided by the palace, presumably with Amrik and Prospero's approval, and there are masculine style military clothes in her wardrobe, in her colors. We couldn't see any reason why she shouldn't wear them. The tiara presented a bit of a problem, because it wouldn't sit with the jeweled combs Nalini uses to keep her hair tidy. Nalini's hair is quite long, falling about a hand span below her bra strap, and she either braids it or uses combs to keep it in place. Tucking her hair behind her ears is not an option she likes. In the end, she decided to braid it into a single braid and wear the tiara.
When Prospero arrived later we were all sitting in the living area, drinking and chatting. Paula and Liz were wearing formal gowns and strappy low heeled court shoes. One thing they find tedious about formal dinners is that they have no choice in the colors they wear, their formal clothes are in their house colors, and that is how it is. Paula was wearing red, black and yellow of Prospero's house colors. Liz was wearing red and green this time. The palace dressmakers and tailors were in the process of providing her with a wardrobe, so this time she didn't have to borrow clothes from Prospero's household. Liz had wanted to wear the aboriginal colors of red, black and yellow, but they were Prospero's house colors. Prospero had stated that it was unthinkable for anyone to wear house colors unless they were a liveried servant, or family, or betrothed as in Paula's case. Other combinations she'd liked were in use, and she didn't like my colors or Nalini's colors, or the combination of all four of ours (black, green, dark blue and pale blue). Eventually Liz had chosen red and green as one of the few available combinations.
Prince Rupert was wearing black polished riding boots, sky blue trousers with a gold stripe and a maroon jacket festooned with gold braid, one of the available color combinations. The servant hovering in the background serving was dressed in Prospero's livery, trousers striped with vertical stripes of red, black and yellow, and a matching striped tabard top. The vertical stripes denote a liveried servant in Aquilonia; no one else wears striped clothing.
Prospero greeted us, looked Nalini up and down, and then remarked mildly &quot;Ladies are supposed to wear an evening gown. But you are a warrior, Amrik will have no problem with you wearing military clothes. Now, if you will excuse me, I must bathe and change rapidly.&quot; He was gone. Paula followed him.
None of us knew how the preliminary discussion went. Charles had returned earlier, but had not seen fit to discuss things with us. Instead he had retired to his chambers. Prince Rupert had declared that it wasn't his place to raise the issue with Charles, nor should he enter Charles' chambers uninvited.
&quot;King Charles is a very private person.&quot; Rupert observed. &quot;He does not discuss the affairs of state with others. He will ask advice of his advisors, but he never discusses what he might think, only what they might think.&quot;
It occurred to me that this was the ploy of someone who did not know what to do on a matter. If you have no opinion, ask your advisors, but never let on that you have no opinion, and they will think you a wise man. &quot;Then it is likely he will want no advice for these negotiations. I wonder if this is going to work?&quot;
So we waited, and chatted.
Eventually Prospero returned, dressed formally. &quot;You've kept us in suspense&quot; Nalini commented &quot;so why not tell us before anyone else is here?&quot;
Prospero sat down and took a large drink his servant offered. He sculled about half the glass before he sat back. &quot;Ah, I needed that! Well, Prince Rupert, will you give me your word that what ever we may say within these four walls on this matter is private, and will not be conveyed to the king?&quot;
Rupert looked thoughtful. &quot;Will you give me your word that you will say nothing treasonous, or at least nothing that would cause me to commit treason by failing to tell my king?&quot;
Prospero smiled. &quot;You have my word, Prince Rupert, that we will require nothing treasonous from you. It is just that we might touch upon how to maneuver the king to agree to some point. Perhaps in those circumstances, you could agree to leave the room?&quot;
Prince Rupert smiled in return. &quot;I shall give you my word not to say anything, but should something arise of which I feel is my duty to tell the king, I will warn you that you should refrain from discussing that matter further in my presence.&quot;
Prospero sighed. &quot;Fine! Sometimes I feel that politics will make an old man of me! Life as a soldier was much simpler. Today was not a day to discuss solutions, today was not a day to discuss the issues, today was a day to raise issues we should be discussing, and problems we should be trying to solve. I believe that we have succeeded in obtaining agreement on the scope of the discussions, and general agreement of the direction of the talks, without prejudice to the outcome. There were some differences of opinion, and the discussion at times grew rather vigorous, but on the whole I would say we have definitely moved our efforts over at least one significant hurdle.&quot;
&quot;Hey Prospero, could you cut out the political speak, and talk plain English?&quot; Nalini chided.
Prospero laughed. &quot;That was one of our hurdles. Durathror will be an integral part of our negotiations.&quot; He paused, gauging the looks on our faces. &quot;My English is not good. Right now I am speaking Aquilonian, but you understand me because of the translation spell. Charles and Cromwell speak English, and read and write English. I can speak some English, and read and write moderately well, but for these negotiations I must speak Aquilonian. We progressed to a point where Charles and Cromwell agreed to sit in the same room, and raise issues without trying to find a solution. I wanted them written on a blackboard, but that caused problems. As you know, a translation spell cannot work with the written word. I had to have Durathror write in English on one blackboard, while one of my scribes wrote in Aquilonian on another blackboard. Perhaps one of you other native English speakers can fill in for Durathror from time to time, but he has expressed his interest in attending most sessions. He has a wealth of experience he can bring to bear on matters.&quot;
&quot;So how far did you actually get?&quot; I asked.
&quot;We now have four blackboards covered with issues, but they seem to have agreed that all the issues they have to discuss have been written down. The issues weren't to be discussed, simply raised, but that did not stop the two of them from blaming each other for things. The recriminations grew quite heated at times, once my lord Amrik had to threaten to beat both of them bloody - that's his words - if they did not sit down and behave like gentlemen. The issues range from the sublime to the ridiculous, from the earth shattering to the petty. But they are now on the blackboard, and we can discuss each one in as much detail as we need until a compromise is reached that is acceptable to both of them. Eventually we will reach agreement on all points, and then they can go home and implement the solutions.&quot;
&quot;I think that last statement may be a little idealistic, Prospero.&quot; I remarked. &quot;They may need a lot of baby sitting to implement the solutions. How can you be sure they won't just renege on their promises once they get home?&quot;
&quot;That will be the last part of our discussions, about guarantees and safety precautions. Exactly what we will do has yet to be formulated, but I think we will need observers and advisors. Imladril has hinted at providing some assistance there. I am coming to realize that this could take many weeks to resolve, but at least Cromwell and Charles have agreed to discuss the issues and try to resolve them. For that I think we have to thank Danny, Nalini and Durathror for guiding Cromwell in interpreting scripture, and in exposing the gods who appeared before him as imposters.&quot;
&quot;Uh... just a minor point Prospero, they were Jesus and his apostles, you don't refer to them as gods.&quot;
&quot;Oh, thank you, I will try to remember that.&quot;
&quot;How many issues are there?&quot; Nalini asked.
&quot;I think there are forty seven, at one a day that is quite a long time. Some may take less of course. Oh, while I think of it, we will need some of you to act as scribes, because once my scribes have taken notes on the salient points of a discussion, we will have to write that up in English to give back to Charles and Cromwell.&quot;
 &quot;That may not be as easy as it sounds,&quot; I pointed out another hurdle. &quot;because their English is quite different from ours. There is over three hundred years of changes, some words have dropped out of use, others have changed meaning, and a whole host of new ones have cropped up. We might have to go over it in several iterations, with Cromwell and Charles correcting each draft.&quot;
&quot;Oh dear, I hadn't thought of that.&quot; Prospero drank the last of his wine. &quot;I believe we should pay our respects on king Charles, and invite him to join us in the ante room for some polite conversation before dinner. We have perhaps half an hour before we should go to the dining hall.&quot;
Tobias, James and Robert were already sitting in the ante room talking over a glass of wine. All three were dressed similarly to Rupert. Liz remarked on that, Prospero replied &quot;King Charles has expressed the desire that all of you be dressed the same. We explained the use of colors by our noble houses to him, and he decided you should all wear England's royal colors on formal occasions.&quot;
Tobias remarked &quot;I would like an explanation as well.&quot;
&quot;Very well. In Aquilonia, each noble family is referred to as a noble house. Traditionally each noble house has three colors which combined will uniquely identify that house. I believe it stems from the distant feudal past, where nobles fought one another, and their knights and soldiers wore identifying colors. We only do this now for formal occasions. Last night, you all wore two colors, which is acceptable for visitors. Unfortunately, a number of the richer merchants and manufacturers have established their own combinations of two colors, these combinations are now no longer available for visitors. Three needs approval from the king, which he has granted to King Charles for his royal colors. You may not be aware, but the colors red, blue and white are King Amrik's own colors. You wear them reversed, red trousers and a blue jacket would declare you an officer in King Amrik's army.&quot;
Tobias nodded. &quot;This reminds me of what the bard wrote, where the houses of Montague and Capulet have their own colors. We are all happy to wear England's colors, 'twill bite the thumb at the puritans.&quot; He grinned.
At this point, the door to King Charles chambers opened, and Charles entered the room. He was dressed similarly to his cavaliers, except that he wore white silk stockings and high heeled shoes. He carried a walking stick of dark wood, with a silver knob. There were blue ribbons in his hair, and his moustache appeared to have been waxed.
Prince Rupert and the three nobles stood when he entered the room, the rest of us remained seated. They bowed, we nodded in greeting. Prospero announced &quot;Your Highness, we have reserved the best seat for yourself. Please be seated.&quot;
The king sat, then his supporters sat. He smiled a quirky smile at Prospero. &quot;It is obvious to me that customs are different between our two kingdoms. We are your guests, it behooves us abide by your customs.&quot; He stopped to talk briefly with a servant, before accepting a glass of fortified wine, similar to sherry. &quot;This particular drop is rather good. Better even than that which Spain manufactures. You may be aware that we do not trade with Spain. We would appreciate if we could take some of this with us when we return to England.&quot;
Prospero smiled &quot;Of course King Charles. We are working to ensure that you return in honor to England, and sit on its throne once more.&quot;
&quot;And do not think we are unappreciative of your efforts, lord Prospero.&quot; Charles replied smoothly. &quot;We would prefer to clap Cromwell and his cronies in irons, and return victoriously, but we realize that would require a sizeable army, and many people would die in the process. A restoration with honor is by far the best course, though it may take a while to wear Cromwell down. We are surprised you managed to persuade Cromwell to agree to discuss all the issues we raised, he is quite stiff necked.&quot;
&quot;He has had a few shocks in recent days, not the least of which were disturbing dreams wherein his god revealed that his previous actions were in service of the devil. Danny has caused him further soul searching by quoting scripture at him and explaining to him some of the errors in his interpretation of scripture.&quot;
They talked for a time about some of the issues raised, more important ones having to do with the curbing of the king's power by parliament. The king would need parliamentary approval for any laws he should suggest. The king would also have a separate council of advisors not drawn from parliament, and would have the power of veto over anything parliament might try to legislate. Charles was not exactly happy with the idea, but since he could not win a civil war and impose his own ideas, he had to fall back to the best compromise. Any restoration was better than none, though I had the impression that he might renege on certain guarantees once he had been reinstated as England's monarch.
Prospero finally shut off the discussion with the words &quot;However your majesty, these issues will be discussed in full another day. We will have experts give presentations on the subject so that all of us are able to discuss it from a position of knowledge. May I suggest we leave further discussion until then?&quot;
King Charles nodded. &quot;Yes, let us not spoil our dinner with such discussions. We are aware of how the political process works; it is often a slow process. You strike us as a wily politician, beneath your mild manner there is a steely determination. We have confidence that you will steer these negotiations to an acceptable and honorable conclusion.&quot;
Prospero waved deprecatingly. &quot;You are too kind, your majesty. But I am endeavoring to navigate these negotiations through rocky waters and into a safe harbor. We will not be spending all out days at the negotiating table, we are planning entertainments and other diversions. Also, I am not sure if you are aware, but in four days time we celebrate the marriage of King Amrik to the lady Enyil.&quot;
At this point a servant entered, and waited discretely to be noticed. Prospero looked up. &quot;Ah, I believe it is time for us to enter the dining hall.&quot;
The servant nodded. &quot;My Lord, the king sends word that the other guests are assembled. He bids you join him.&quot;
&quot;Good, tell him we are on our way.&quot;
We rose, collected our things, and set off. Prospero explained to Nalini and me &quot;I should have told you earlier, but the king wanted this to be a surprise. You two are the guests of honor. You will sit on his table tonight.&quot;
&quot;What are we being honored for?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Ah, you know how he decreed that you and Nalini would be given citizenship and noble rank? You have not been back since, so he has been unable to present you with the deeds to your estate, nor has it been publicly announced. So tonight is the night.&quot;
When we reached the dining hall, the others were lead to sit at the same table where Cromwell and his companions were already seated. There were several other people already seated there at the other end of the table, one of whom I recognized as Prospero's mother. She was seated by the empty head of the table. Their table was adjacent to the king's own table. We however, were lead to sit with Amrik and Enyil, who tonight also had Imladril, Iskandor, Durathror, Ra'anor and Atlendor with them.
The king welcomed us, then stood to make a short speech. &quot;Tonight, we belatedly honor two people to whom both Prospero and I owe our lives, not once, but several times over. It is a long tale, I will not tell it in detail tonight. A year ago, as many of you know, our land was suffering depredations from the servants of the serpent god. Prospero and I set out with a crack body of soldiers to investigate and put a stop to this. Unfortunately for us, the rulers of the serpent spawn were two evil sorcerers. Our company was captured, and the other soldiers were sacrificed one by one to the serpent god, while we languished in a foul dungeon. Danny's sister the Lady Paula, who is now Lord Prospero's betrothed, was also seized, and cast into the dungeon with Prospero and myself. Danny and Nalini rescued us, and with their aid we destroyed the serpent spawn who pursued us, and made our way safely to Tarantia. We knew we were not safe here until we had destroyed all the serpent spawn in their lair. Prince Durathror, Prince Iskandor and Lord Atlendor offered to aid us, and we returned to the lair of the serpent god to destroy the entire nest of vipers. While we fought with them, the two sorcerers summoned their serpent god whom I will not name. That evil god would have laid waste to all of Aquilonia, except that Danny and Nalini called on their god who helped them to banish the serpent god. But for them we would not be here tonight and likely many of you would not be here either. Once the demon was banished, we were able to destroy the sorcerers, and wipe their nest of vipers from the face of the earth.&quot;
He turned to us and continued &quot;Please stand up Danny and Nalini. As a token for your service, I said I would give you an earldom as your fief, but since then you have been in your home kingdom, and I have been unable to present you with your titles. I now declare you officially the Earl and Earlrina...&quot; there is an official title for the Earl's wife just as a duke has a duchess. I have rendered this 'earlrina' for want of a better term in English. &quot;..of the fief of Bendora. You will need to discuss with the master herald what colors you will use for this estate, because I have created it from land holdings the crown has following the civil war. Please come over here.&quot;
He turned to four pages behind him who were carrying things on cushions. &quot;Firstly, here is a copy of your title deeds.&quot; He presented each of us with a scroll tied with red ribbon. We unrolled it to reveal Aquilonian writing which neither of us could read, and a large seal at the bottom right hand corner. The page moved around beside us and held out the cushion to receive the scrolls again. &quot;Now here is your chain of office, one for each of you.&quot; He presented us each with a thick gold chain from which hung a heavy gold medallion. Incised into the metal was an eagle and a tiger. We slipped the chains over our neck. &quot;This box contains the seal of Bendora, and the signet ring.&quot; He opened it to show us a solid ivory seal, and a gold signet ring. He then closed the box and handed it back to the page. Another page held a cushion with two small boxes on it. &quot;These are your military pips, one set for each of you. Nalini, you must have known I had a set for you. Now, let me pin them to your collar.&quot; The pips were for the rank of junior general, a stooping hawk in gold. Senior generals have a gold sun, while Prospero as second in command of the entire kingdom has two gold suns, and Amrik has a gold crown. The emblem has a pin on the back that is pressed through the collar and into a butten designed to receive it, meaning it can easily be moved from jacket to jacket. &quot;Now that you have estates here, I hope you will spend more time with us.&quot;
He stepped forward, kissed Nalini on both cheeks, then did the same for me. He was beaming. &quot;Thanks guys.&quot; he said in heavy English. Then he raised his voice again. &quot;My lords and ladies, I present to you the earl and earlrina of Bendora.&quot;
There was general applause around the room. King Charles and the others wore thoughtful expressions. The story of fighting sorcerers and banishing gods had obviously set them thinking.
&quot;Thank you Amrik. Thank you very much. You should have warned us though, we could have prepared a speach.&quot; We were both grinning.
&quot;I wanted it to be a surprise.&quot; he replied. &quot;Without notes, you will have to keep it short, lad. The rest of us are starving!&quot;
So I said a few words in reply. Nothing great, just some sincere words. &quot;Thank you your majesty, this is a great honor for us. We just did what we had to as part of the fight against injustice and evil in the world. We couldn't have done that without you and the brave soldiers of Aquilonia. You are playing your part in banishing evil and promoting justice in Aquilonia, we are proud to be a small part of that. Aquilonia is a wonderful country, we will definitely be spending more time here. Once again, thank you.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;I'd just like to add that you are a very noble person, your majesty. We admire what you are doing here to bring good and equitable government to Aquilonia. You set an example to the other kingdoms that will shine for thousands of years. Thank you for honoring us.&quot;
Amrik looked almost embarrassed at this. He grunted, put one hand on her shoulder, then the other on mine. &quot;I can't do it without people like you.&quot; Then he took a deep breath, smiled. &quot;Right, I'm starving! Let's have some food!&quot;
Waiters began bringing the food to the table. Over on the next table, Prospero was speaking animatedly. My intuition told me he was elaborating on Amrik's tale. Amrik saw my gaze, and commented &quot;I distrust those puritans. Any man who hates pleasure cannot be human; and their king is only half a man, he wears high heels and ribbons like a woman. What sort of place is England?&quot;
&quot;Different cultures, different customs. But they are struggling with the same sorts of problems you did. They have a king who believes he is god's own representative, they have Cromwell who believes the same. They were moving toward parliamentary government, but instead they both adopted extreme positions, and now they have a civil war.&quot;
Amrik grunted, and spoke around a mouthful of food. &quot;Well, 'tis Prospero's problem now. I wash my hands of them.&quot;
Imladril commented &quot;Charles and Oliver dislike each other intensely. But your assessment is correct, they both believe they are god's own representative, neither believes they should compromise. If anything, Charles is a little more flexible, primarily because he has lost his throne and seeks to win it back. His religious position is less extreme, but he has less compassion than Oliver. Charles does not care about the common people, Oliver does, but Oliver's compassion is marred by his religious views. He hates Jews, Catholics, witches and the Irish with a passion. But following the unmasking of his guides, he is in turmoil. We must work on him each night, and guide him into extending his compassion. Charles is more likely to favor the nobility, Oliver has more potential to be a good leader because he is aware of Charles's failings.&quot;
&quot;But how can you work with someone who sees things in terms of black and white, and will not compromise?&quot;
For a moment, Imladril looked like an old mind in a young body. Although she looks about sixteen, her eyes looked far older. &quot;If they will not bend, then they must be broken, like horses.&quot;
I commented &quot;I think we need to force him to think about Nicodemus's question: 'Who is my neighbor'.&quot;
Seeing some puzzled looks, I added &quot;Jesus taught 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'. Nicodemus asked him 'Lord, who is my neighbor?'. At the moment, Cromwell's answer is 'Puritans and most Anglicans, but no others.'. If we could get him to extend that to the entire human race, then his zeal would do much good.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;But he's a fanatic though. He could do much evil in the name of good.&quot;
&quot;I think that the king and Cromwell should both be part of the government, that way they'll tend to act to keep each other honest.&quot; I commented.
&quot;Neither having more power than the other?&quot; Enyil asked. &quot;It might work, but we need to go beyond their dislike of one another.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;So how did today's session go?&quot;
Amrik laughed. &quot;Neither trusts the other. Charles does not want a parliament, Cromwell does not want a king. I had to threaten to bash their heads together before they would talk. They will end up with a government such as we are setting up, though they may not know that now.&quot; He looked to Enyil. &quot;We have investigated various forms of government, we have decided that a parliamentary government where the king has the same powers as parliament seems to work the best. It is loose enough that good people can rise in parliament, and the people's concerns can be heard, yet there is the continuity of the kingship, and the ability to make long term plans.&quot;
&quot;The king is still a weak link if he becomes self interested.&quot; Enyil added. &quot;I would like to see a mechanism for the king to be removed, and another one installed, perhaps something like our own society&quot; she indicated the other Viharani at the table &quot;where the king or queen is elected, then stays in office until they die, decide to retire, or are removed by the council because they are unfit.&quot;
&quot;But we do not elect kings!&quot; Amrik countered. &quot;The nobles and the people would not stand for it.&quot;
Durathror leaned forward. &quot;Consider, lord Amrik, under the government you are setting up, the old king is reborn and becomes king. How would you deal with that? How would you remove him without a civil war?&quot;
&quot;He could not be the despot that he was. He could not torture or kill without being found guilty of a crime. Once he is found guilty of a crime, he can no longer remain king.&quot; Amrik replied.
&quot;Now what constitutes a crime?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Anything that requires he be sentenced to prison: murder, torture, treason and numerous other crimes. Once he is convicted, the parliament can then unilaterally require him to abdicate. But at present, the throne would pass to whomever is next in line. I do not like the idea of electing kings, I am sorry.&quot;
&quot;Don't be sorry.&quot; Imladril replied. &quot;The solution has to be what works for your people. Election tends to ensure that popular people get the job, and only those who want the job put themselves up for election. Of course, the risk is that those who want the job often have a hidden agenda.&quot;
Amrik laughed again. &quot;I was going to reply that a king is trained from birth to be a king, but of course I never was. I learned much in the army.&quot;
&quot;What sort of issues did they raise?&quot; Nalini asked again.
&quot;Oh,&quot; Enyil replied, &quot;we have big issues like can the king govern without parliament, can parliament govern without a king, we have smaller issues like money to run the king's estates and household, who can sit in parliament, and we have petty issues like the title of the parliamentary leader. There are many petty issues.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;But they are likely to be bigger sticking points than most of the larger issues.&quot;
Amrik commented &quot;One issue they did not raise, but one I will raise with them tomorrow, is the issue of bathing. Some of those puritans stink, they have not bathed since they arrived! Tomorrow morning, when they arrive for breakfast, those who have not bathed will be arrested and taken before a magistrate.&quot;
Ra'anor commented &quot;You might find it best to caution them this time, but come down hard if they persist.&quot;
Amrik nodded. &quot;I plan to scare them, threaten them with public scrubbing with the sort of brushes farmers use to prepare their pigs and cattle for market. But I will give them a chance to escape that fate.&quot;
We changed topics after this, and discussed a wide range of topics during the meal. Amrik was learning energy exercises and starting on the path to sorcery. Imladril and Durathror wanted to know how well he was progressing.
Amrik shrugged. &quot;I train every morning. Enyil and I do things in dreaming, and often one of you is there as well. You should know how well I am doing.&quot;
&quot;Ah, but this is waking, what you do in dreaming may not be brought into waking.&quot;
&quot;Well, I can perform a few simple spells. Invisibility interests me, but I realize that this one is hard.&quot;
Durathror nodded. &quot;Sorcery can be divided into a number of areas, usually of increasing difficulty. Spells of illusion are the easiest category, then come shadow shifting, spells that influence the physical world, and then shapeshifting and similar spells that affect the substance. Invisibility is a spell of illusion. Most invisibility illusions will not really make you invisible, but will render you such that people do not notice you.&quot;
&quot;Illusion to change my appearance interests me much, then could I slip out and go about like a normal citizen from time to time. Kingship irks me greatly. But I do not want to go into a tavern and find I cannot be served because no one notices me!&quot;
Durathror chuckled. &quot;Well lord Amrik, if you persevere, then one day you will be able to shape shift, and actually don any appearance you like. That is one of the harder disciplines, and takes time to master.&quot;
&quot;And one day I will put my son on the throne, and go travelling! By then I hope to be good enough to travel through shadow, and I will visit my friends.&quot;
Enyil replied &quot;My love, you will be able to walk through shadows long before any son of ours comes of age.&quot;
Amrik suddenly smiled. &quot;Hah! Then shall I leave Prospero as regent! He has his fun now, gallivanting around with Paula, and leaving me to run the kingdom, so shall I do the same to him once I can shadow shift.&quot;
Imladril smiled at him. &quot;I think you boys will go travelling together one day. If you set the government up properly, you won't need a king to keep things running.&quot;
&quot;Now that is the goal of my kingship - to be able to step down later, and enjoy my life. But I will not hear of the next king being elected, my son shall sit upon my throne.&quot;
The conversation then turned to interesting shadows, past events, and such like. Durathror made the mistake of sounding a little boastful about his prowess with a sword, leading to Amrik challenging him to a training session on the morrow. &quot;It's not that I doubt your prowess, Prince Durathror, but that I am hard pressed to find anyone who is a worthy opponent for me.&quot;
Durathror smiled serenely, and twirled his moustache. &quot;Well your majesty, I hope you will not be disappointed. I will endeavor to give you your money's worth.&quot; His eyes were shining, as if he was relishing the prospect of some sword play.
Eventually came the dancing, for which I partnered Nalini on the floor. King Charles was dancing with Prospero's mother, a regal looking woman in her early forties. During a lull in the music, we took time to talk with Prospero and Paula. Prospero commented &quot;My mother is a widow, it suits her to partner a visiting king. He can be quite charming when he is being social. I think they are enjoying themselves. The puritans are not. Four of them smell abominably, and they all disapprove of dancing and music. Cromwell, Matthew, Thomas and Tobias had a heated discussion about whether you were witches to fight sorcerers and banish the serpent god. All the puritans plus Robert are refusing to speak with Liz because she told people she is catholic. Oh, and Cromwell wants to visit one of our places of worship tomorrow. Apart from that, we are all having an enjoyable time.&quot;
&quot;When the dancing takes a break, why don't you take Paula and go sit with the king, while we have a chat with the puritans?&quot; I commented. Prospero nodded. The music started, and he and Paula commenced dancing.
Nalini turned to me &quot;Let's sit these ones out.&quot; She led the way toward the puritans. Everyone else was up dancing, even the three cavaliers seemed to have found partners.
Cromwell was talking with Matthew, and looked up with a sour expression when we approached. &quot;Hi Cromwell, Matthew, are you enjoying yourselves?&quot;
&quot;Dancing leads to sin!&quot; Matthew stressed. &quot;We are only here because it is polite.&quot;
Cromwell looked directly at me. &quot;Young man, are you a witch?&quot;
&quot;Do I look like one? Do I act like one? Why would you think I would be one?&quot;
&quot;You two have powers normal people do not. This tale of fighting sorcerers and banishing demons, how else but if you were a witch?&quot;
I laughed. &quot;Lord Cromwell, I fear you do not know your scripture well enough. Just so the Pharisees accused Jesus of casting out demons by the power of Satan. I give you his reply, do you remember it?&quot;
He nodded. &quot;Aye, I know it. 'If I cast out demons in the name of Lucifer, then his kingdom is divided, and cannot stand. I tell you I cast out demons in the name of my father in heaven'. Under other circumstances I might accuse you of blasphemy, except duke Prospero and lady Paula assure me it happened as the king described; that a demon in the form of a huge serpent did indeed appear, and that you and the lady Nalini banished it.&quot; He looked me in the eye for several seconds while I looked back at him. &quot;Sir, you are a difficult man, you force me to question me dearly held beliefs, yet do I believe that at heart you are a good man.&quot;
&quot;I could say the same about you. But I would add that my purpose in part is to show you that your interpretation of the scripture is at times flawed, and to teach you how it should be interpreted. I do not fault you for your zeal, merely some of your interpretations.&quot;
He harrumphed at this, but before he could make answer, Nalini asked &quot;What is this we have heard about you people refusing to speak to Liz because she is catholic?&quot;
&quot;Catholics are idol worshippers, they would lead us astray with their interpretation of scripture!&quot; Matthew exclaimed.
Cromwell added &quot;Their theology is flawed, their pope is a servant of Satan, sent to lead us from the straight and narrow path onto the road to hell, through idolatry and blasphemy.&quot;
&quot;Really now!&quot; Nalini exclaimed. &quot;Are you that evil that you must classify Catholics as idolaters and demon worshippers?&quot;
&quot;Yes, they worship the saints in direct contradiction to our holy scriptureà&quot; Matthew started.
Henry, one of the puritans of noble birth seated across the table, interjected loudly &quot;The only good catholic is a dead catholic!&quot;
&quot;Really now? And is that what you are trying to do with your witch trials? Round up the Catholics and put them to death? Will your inquisitors go through every town and village, rooting out Catholics and killing them?&quot; I stood up.
Cromwell made some calming remark &quot;No, only those who work treason or worship the devil.&quot;
&quot;And why not?&quot; Henry asked back. &quot;They all worship the devil! We will root out all of them, and purify England.&quot;
My voice was cold. Icy fingers were running up and down my spine. A lot of things my grandfather had said about the nazis in Poland came back to me. &quot;Well, will you implement the final solution? Rid England of all Catholics? Send your inquisitors through every town and village, separate them out from true Christians, take them out into the fields, there to make them dig a large pit, and then line them up on the edge and shoot them?&quot;
&quot;Yes, it's a good idea! More efficient than our witch trials!&quot; Henry exclaimed. &quot;By god, we will rid England of Catholics!&quot;
Cromwell said &quot;No Henry! That is not the way.&quot; But it was too late.
&quot;So Henry, why not include witches, Jews, the Irish, and anyone else you don't like in that list, and purge the land of all of them?&quot;
&quot;And why not? England would be a better place without them. They all intrigue with our enemies.&quot;
I leaped onto the table, stooped and grasped him by the scruff of his neck, lifting him bodily from his chair. I shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. At this point the music stopped. Aware that all eyes were upon me, I spoke slowly and deliberately. &quot;You piece of shit! You festering sore! You're not the first criminal to try his hand at genocide, and you won't be the last.&quot; My voice was icy cold. &quot;My grandfather lost his entire family thanks to filth like you! When he was my age, shit like you massacred six million people in the name of purity, and another thirty million died during the war to stop them.&quot; I put my face close to his. He was red faced, his eyes wide with fear. He smelled of unwashed body, and shit. In his fear he had soiled himself. &quot;You disgust me!&quot; He was becoming rather heavy; I flung him back into his chair, where he fell over backwards. I rounded on the other puritans. &quot;I accuse all of you of genocide against Catholics, Jews, and others in your witch persecutions. I intend to stop you. Is that clear?&quot; I leaped down beside Henry, hauled him to his feet. He was almost gibbering with fear, and the front of his trousers was wet with urine. &quot;Get out of my sight! Now!&quot; He turned and ran from the hall.
Maybe I over-reacted a little. Amrik, Prospero and others were making their way over to us. I took a deep breath, calmed myself, and then smiled ruefully at the others. &quot;Sorry, but I have a thing against people who espouse mass murder as the solution to their problems.&quot;
Nalini explained quickly to Amrik and Prospero what Henry had said. Amrik looked grim. &quot;We deposed and killed Sorono for less than that.&quot; He looked at the puritans one by one. &quot;Which of you agree with Henry? Speak up!&quot;
Cromwell stated loudly &quot;We do not advocate murder of anyone. Only those who commit crimes meriting death, and they should be executed by the official executioner.&quot;
&quot;Boldly spoken&quot; Prospero replied with a sarcastic lilt, &quot;but the massacre of the king's troops at the battle where we rescued prince Rupert gives the lie to that. You gave the orders for that massacre Cromwell.&quot;
&quot;I did not! Those orders were given in my name by lord Henry.&quot;
&quot;Are you telling the truth, or merely blaming a convenient scapegoat?&quot; I asked him.
&quot;I am telling the truth sir! And I apologize for lord Henry's statements.&quot;
&quot;Well, your conscience will answer before god.&quot;
Amrik stated flatly &quot;I will ask again. Which of you support Henry? I want an answer from each of you, and I want it now.&quot; He looked at each of the puritans in turn, and each quailed before his gaze, shaking their heads.
Amrik looked at Cromwell. &quot;We executed old king Sorono for those sorts of crimes. Your witch trials are no different. You are the ruler, lord Cromwell, you are responsible for any crimes your underlings commit in your name. If I were king of England, I would have you and your followers tried for mass murder. I suggest you think on that when next you negotiate with king Charles.&quot; He turned around, waving his hands in the air. &quot;All right, music! Let there be dancing!&quot; He lead Enyil back to the dance floor.
Nalini took my arm and lead me back onto the dance floor, even though we have trouble with some of the dances. I was feeling just a little bit embarrassed about my outburst. Nalini kissed me. &quot;Hey, don't be silly. I'm proud you stood up to him like that. The only reason Hitler ever got as far as he did was people didn't stand up to him early enough. Someone should have done that to them when they first proposed their witch trials.&quot;
&quot;Hmm, but I still believe that violence is the last resort of the incompetent. He said stupid and criminal things, but I'm the one who threatened physical violance.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, but sometimes there is no other alternative that's as effective.&quot;
Liz and Rupert came up to us while we danced. &quot;Hey, I'm glad you did that to Henry, he's a piece of shit.&quot;
Nalini interrupted &quot;Hey, let's swap!&quot; I let her go, she grabbed Rupert.
Liz looked at them, then grabbed me. &quot;Okay, let's dance.&quot;
&quot;Why do you reckon he's a piece of shit? Did he tell you the only good catholic is a dead one?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Yep. How'd you know?&quot;
&quot;He told me the same, and I lost my temper. You should have told me when he said it, I would have straightened him out then and there.&quot;
&quot;Thanks Danny. I'm just glad you sorted him out anyway. Hey, I didn't realize you were that strong.&quot;
&quot;Neither did I until I lifted him. He was pretty heavy though, I couldn't hold him for long.&quot;
Liz was grinning at me. &quot;Hey, it looked impressive!&quot;
&quot;No problem. Hey, do you know the steps to this one?&quot;
&quot;Sort of, Rupert was showing me these steps. C'mon, I'll show you.&quot; She began swirling me across the floor. When next I looked around, all the puritans had left.
During the remainder of the evening we swapped partners several times. I managed to dance with Paula, Enyil, Ra'anor, Imladril and Liz as well as Nalini.
During one of the breaks in the music, we had a little round table discussion about the negotiations that Prospero had planned for the next few weeks. Prospero was worried &quot;This is going to be perhaps the most difficult negotiations I have ever chaired. I am not sure how we guide them to the results we want.&quot;
&quot;Prospero, you're the facilitator.&quot; I commented. &quot;As such, you should not be telling them what the outcome of the negotiations are. Your task is to keep them focussed on the issue they are discussing. Side issues you write on the blackboard and discuss later. You have to be ruthless about that. As a general rule, you shouldn't worry about what the outcome of a discussion is, as long as there is an outcome. But I'd have certain items as non negotiable, like dismantling the persecutions. Whether you tell them that before hand I don't know.&quot;
Prospero shook his head. &quot;Danny, you're talking management. I've read the books you have, but I don't agree that management is completely applicable to political negotiations. We want to direct them to particular outcomes.&quot;
&quot;Do you really? Don't you have a set of outcomes that are acceptable?&quot;
Imladril commented &quot;I am inclined to agree with Prospero, that there are certain outcomes you want to achieve here. Religious persecution has to be removed, as does the despotic rule of the king, and Cromwell's domination of parliament.&quot;
&quot;But the whole point is you can't just start by telling them that.&quot; I put in. &quot;That's why Prospero's job is so hard, he has to appear to be impartial, he has to tell them he doesn't care about the outcome so they feel free to discuss the outcome. Then he has to subtly direct their negotiations in the direction he wants.&quot;
&quot;I thought that was what I started with.&quot; Prospero complained. &quot;I want to direct them to the right outcomes, you started by saying I shouldn't. I'm glad we agree now.&quot;
Nalini responded &quot;But part of the problem is that both of them are rulers, they don't care about the ordinary people. I think you need someone else there to represent the ordinary people, and make sure that their interests are protected.&quot;
Imladril added &quot;Nalini is right, negotiations have to take place between all the interested parties, otherwise those left out have their interests forgotten. We need to include someone to look out for the interests of the ordinary people. Maybe we can all take turns?&quot;
Prospero observed &quot;They may not accept third parties, but it might work. As facilitator, I can't be facilitating and thinking of issues at the same time.&quot;
Durathror commented &quot;I think you need to decide how many people the king has in his team, and restrict Cromwell to the same number. Then we can supply a similar number in a team that represents the interests of the ordinary people. And I think that Danny and Nalini should play an important part in that team, they have the best exposure to a culture that tries to protect the interests of everyone.&quot;
Imladril added &quot;I think we Viharani should also play a part in that team. But we don't want to have the negotiations occupying our waking hours for the next three weeks or so.&quot;
Prospero shook his head. &quot;That isn't my intention either, I have a life to live as well! I was thinking of afternoon or morning sessions only, and possibly only every second day. We have a session scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, after that I will be busy until after the wedding.&quot;
&quot;You do realize that these negotiations could last many weeks?&quot; Iskandor asked. &quot;I doubt if any of us is willing to stay that long.&quot;
&quot;I plan on telling our participants that they cannot go home until they have resolved every point, even if that means staying years. I think that should be sufficient incentive for them to resolve their differences. But I would like all of you to think how we can ensure that the king and Cromwell stick with their agreements. I do not want suggestions now, but over the next few weeks. Once we send them back are we going to baby sit them?&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;I am happy for us to take a similar role to that which we play here. We could supply a small team of observers who will watch what happens and try to guide outcomes. But their culture increases the risk for us, because they kill sorcerers.&quot; She nodded at Iskandor, who had presumably made a telepathic comment to her. &quot;Yes, we will call for volunteers from among our people. Those volunteers should be at least observers to the negotiations, so they have a background understanding of what the antagonists are like. Prospero, you and Paula and Danny and Nalini should also pay them visits from time to time. Perhaps you should establish an embassy, or at least a diplomatic mission? If we are there then you don't need someone who can shadowshift.&quot;
Iskandor added &quot;Your two cultures are at a similar stage, and both are undergoing a transition from kings to parliamentary governments. Even if you do not trade with one another, a diplomatic exchange between England and Aquilonia could benefit both countries.&quot;
&quot;A diplomatic mission might be a good idea, I will talk that over with Amrik. We always have more up and coming nobles and bureaucrats than we can find positions for. But I do not agree that our cultures are similar. We have religious tolerance here, we don't burn sorcerers, I believe we are much more enlightened than they are.&quot;
I looked at Nalini. &quot;Does this mean we should spend time there as observers?&quot;
Nalini smiled, shrugged. &quot;Why not? Saving the world makes a nice change from an office job. We don't really need to work these days, those gems we collected are worth a fortune.&quot; We had collected a saddlebag full of precious stones once while out riding through shadow with Amrik and Enyil, and had returned several times to collect more. We had shared up what we had collected equally with Paula, and now the three of us were independently wealthy. We still worked, but that was partly a cover, and partly because the business had clients who wanted continuing services. That side was handled by other employees, so aside from family and friends, there was nothing pressing keeping us in either my home shadow or Nalini's.
Nalini and I were moving away from client oriented work, and into more artistic endeavors. I have started writing these chronicles, as well as taken up painting again, and Nalini and I spend some time writing programs for general sale. Since we no longer need the work, we can concentrate on what we want. I commented in return &quot;Philanthropy is supposed to be a good occupation for the independently wealthy. I guess that includes meddling in other countries' affairs?&quot;
&quot;Of course! At least now we are in a position to make a difference. I think I would be happy to spend a couple of months in England. Who knows, maybe Liz will want to spend time there with prince Rupert?&quot;
&quot;It won't have decent plumbing though.&quot;
&quot;But you can get used to it for a while. That makes you appreciate the comforts of civilization all the more.&quot;
Prospero joined in our conversation. &quot;We would outfit our embassy building with the comforts we expect here. I think we might import a lot of food stuff as well, their standards of hygiene are abysmal. You two could spend time there as observers, but you could also spend your time here as observers. We still need help in getting our parliamentary democracy off and running.&quot;
&quot;We have to make a trip out to our estates after the wedding, and we might spend a week or so there. Would you want to visit with us Prospero?&quot;
&quot;I would, although I am sort of tied up with the negotiations. Unless you wanted a dozen or more visitors?&quot;
&quot;I'm not sure of the estate, how many guests we can accommodate. Maybe our friends should visit first, and then you can bring the others later? Paula would probably appreciate if you take time out from the negotiations for a quiet holiday.&quot;
&quot;Well, I'm sure they can do without my company for a few days. Very well, say a week after the wedding, we will all go to your estates for a visit. I am sure you will both love your estate.&quot;
&quot;We're sure we will too. I think that the king and Cromwell and their minions might also enjoy some time away from the city. Whether we want them there is another question, but we probably should, in the interests of furthering their negotiations.&quot;

The next morning the puritans ignored me at breakfast. They sat at their own table on the far side of the room, and did not acknowledge my wave to them. &quot;I may have to do something about this.&quot; I commented to Nalini. &quot;This may spoil things for Prospero's negotiations.&quot;
&quot;Not yet, save it.&quot; she responded. &quot;I look at this as part of a softening up process. You know the classic model for interrogations. You are alternately hard and soft with them, and eventually they'll break and tell you what you know. We want to soften them up to the point where they're reasonable.&quot;
&quot;Well, I was thinking of being friendly to Cromwell before they all get arrested for public uncleanliness.&quot;
&quot;Let's eat first. Don't tackle unpleasant jobs on an empty stomach.&quot;
I chuckled &quot;I'd have said that sick making jobs should be tackled on an empty stomach! Less mess that way.&quot;
She laughed with me. &quot;Didn't you tell me a joke about that? Someone apologizes they've a weak stomach, the other person says something like 'I'd say you have quite a strong stomach, that must be at least five feet.' Great topic for breakfast huh?&quot;
We chose a selection of fruits and pastries plus some cheese. Fruit juice was available, freshly squeezed on order. This was a recent addition suggested by Prospero; last time we had visited, breakfast drinks had been limited to wine, water or beer. That was still available for those who preferred a more traditional breakfast. We ordered fruit juice and a pot of coffee, an expensive luxury here. Prospero was currently making a fortune importing coffee beans from our shadow.
We selected a table close to the garden again, and started eating. Paula and Prospero joined us a little later. &quot;Prospero, you should consider trying to grow coffee here. That way it would be available to the general population.&quot;
He grinned. &quot;I am investigating it Danny. Demand for coffee is escalating, I am finding it difficult to keep up with it. But right now prices are high, and so are profits.&quot;
&quot;So you will take advantage of your monopoly to maximize your return?&quot;
&quot;For a time. At present all the coffee beans are roasted, so no one can compete. Once we start growing coffee plants, everyone will be out to steal them, grow their own, and undercut me. I am not a merchant at heart, otherwise I would preserve my monopoly and never grow coffee plants. I need to find suitable land first. It is possible that part of your estate might be suitable, would you want to join in a coffee empire?&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;We were talking earlier about making the change from office jobs. That sounds great Prospero.&quot;
I added &quot;Don't just think growing coffee. We have to go horizontal integration, and build a processing plant that can produce vacuum packed coffee beans. That way it will take your competitors years to catch up.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;I'm not sure about the climate here, but you may find that other countries are more suited to coffee crops.&quot;
&quot;We don't yet know much about growing coffee. We know it needs cooler mountainous regions with suitable rainfall, but not so cold that there is snow. I've been meaning to look that up when I get back to your shadow.&quot;
Nalini responded &quot;I think you'll find the general information will be widely available, but the specifics you'll have to dig for, because it isn't a hobby plant. I think I brought my encyclopedia with me, we can see what that says later.&quot;
I added &quot;Mind you, a lot of the text might not be applicable here, you have different plants and insects, the soils could be different. You know, different pests, different weeds, you might have to do some investigative farming.&quot;
Prospero was nodding. &quot;You have a certain way with words Danny, I don't think anyone else would use that term! I'm easy though, at present I will continue importing roasted beans, but I will investigate growing coffee plants, and building a processing plant.&quot;
Paula commented &quot;I'll say one thing, life with you guys is never dull. None of us is stuck in a rut. But if anyone had tried to tell me what I'd be doing when I applied for a job, I'd have thought they were mad.&quot;
Looking across at the sullen puritans, I remarked to Prospero &quot;Do you think last night's little episode with Henry had crueled your chances of getting the puritans to negotiate? Should I apologize for dropping him on the floor?&quot;
Nalini answered first. &quot;No Danny, I detest bigoted people like Henry, he received what he deserved. It's not as if you hit him. Freedom of speech does not include the right to say racist or criminal comments. And you know it's not so much his rights as his obligations.&quot; I nodded. We'd had many discussions about citizen rights versus citizen obligations; both of us came down firmly on the side of obligations.
Prospero added &quot;It's within your rights to challenge him to a duel for his comments, especially since Liz is regarded as being under your protection; if he doesn't like being dropped on the floor, he can challenge you. If these negotiations fail because of the puritans, we will just take steps to circumvent them, and restore king Charles without their assistance. We'll manage something, one way or the other.&quot;
I felt better about that. &quot;So should we send them back in chains as the king's prisoners?&quot;
Prospero laughed sardonically. &quot;They may not know it yet, but that could well be how we do send them back. With the king restored, they are probably guilty of treason and insurrection.&quot;
Liz and Rupert arrived together, and joined our table. Rupert had a plate piled high with several croissants, while Liz a plate of scrambled eggs and some slices of meat. The meat was smoked to dryness, but had not been cooked. She gave one slice to Rupert who picked it up in his fingers, thanked her and remarked &quot;I must have overlooked this. We have this sort of meats back home.&quot;. He chewed thoughtfully before adding &quot;The smoke is perhaps stronger than our german varieties, the meat is not pork, but it is rather tasty.&quot;
Paula rolled her eyes in mock dismay. &quot;Oh no, not another gourmet! You and Prospero make a good pair!&quot;
Rupert shook his head. &quot;Oh no lady Paula, I am but comparing this with the meats we smoke back home.&quot;
Liz took a croissant from his plate, replaced it with several slices of meat. &quot;I've got more than I need, it's a bit salty for me.&quot;
We sat and talked over our food for a while. Then Cromwell walked over to the food table, so I contrived to walk there behind him.
&quot;Good morning lord Cromwell!&quot; I remarked cheerfully. &quot;And how are you this morning?&quot;
He looked at me for a moment, as if trying to divine my inner thoughts. I looked back, smiling and thinking thoughts of goodwill, peace and harmony. Finally he spoke politely. &quot;Good morning lord Danny. I trust you and your good lady are well? I would be happier to be back on my estates, living the life of a simple country squire, but god has decided otherwise. I often think that the king is one of my trials, now I think you might be another.&quot;
He didn't seem to bear a grudge about last night, but then he was both a committed Christian and a wily politician. I smiled at him &quot;Ah, but struggles and trials build character, and help our growth. Surely I am not that bad?&quot;
&quot;I like to think I am old enough that my character has already been built. Many of your actions embarrass us or offend us. But if I think about them, I must confess that on many occasions I conclude that there are good intentions behind your methods. You seem versed in scripture, though your interpretation thereof is somewhat flawed. However, I am prepared to listen to any arguments you may have that are scripture based; I am just a man, my interpretation may be flawed.&quot;
I smiled deprecatingly. &quot;If you were just an individual, I probably wouldn't bother so much. You are also the leader of parliament, and the man responsible for deposing your king. Along with the others, you have waged a civil war that is presumably still continuing, you have set up the witch persecutions that have caused thousands of innocents to die. What you and your companions believe has direct bearing on the wellbeing of England, and has caused untold suffering, far in excess of the suffering you claimed to be alleviating by removing the king. Personally, I don't care whether the king regains his throne or not. My concern isn't even with your soul, but with the good order of England. Prospero is the same, we want the outcome of these negotiations to be what is best for England.&quot;
&quot;That was our intention when we deposed the king, and when we set up the witch trials. We wished to root out evil and heresy, so that others could live out peaceful and fulfilling lives. With hindsight, we seem to have gone about things the wrong way. Do you despise us?&quot;
&quot;No, I see you as products of your age. We are all products of out ages, except that we have studied history, we see the errors other ages made. If we learn from them, we do not have to repeat them. But you fell into the trap of assuming that the end justifies the means. When the means you use are evil, then you are no better than you enemies, and you become evil yourself.&quot;
He was nodding. &quot;Yes, you have persuaded me that we did fall into that trap. That is why I am prepared to negotiate with king Charles. He behaved badly, but once we deposed him we also behaved badly, and now we must find a way to rectify this. But my principles as a Christian are not negotiable.&quot;
&quot;I am not asking you to abrogate your principles, but I am asking you to consider that some of them could be improved. For example, I read somewhere that you are regarded as an enlightened and tolerant man because you allow other denominations into your army, although you ban Catholics. Where we come from, any discrimination based on religious beliefs is seen as evil. But that attitude is endemic to your society, it can only change slowly as people are educated. That is why a parliamentary democracy is so important - it reflects the standards and beliefs of the society. The best we can do is to show you that your beliefs are flawed, and educate you about a better way. But society changes slowly as people are educated. Would you sit with us and continue this discussion?&quot;
He pursed his lips, then nodded. &quot;This discussion could last for ages. Very well, let us proceed to your table.&quot;
He returned with me, and sat. &quot;We tend to think of society as unchanging, that there is one right way only. I find it hard to consider that there might be more than one right way.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;That's because you see your society as static. Back in the Middle Ages it was self evident that the earth was flat, and that the sun went across the top. All the great religious thinkers of the day agreed in that. We know that was wrong, but they would have been very hard to convince the earth was round. Truth is relative, it has to be couched in terms that people understand.&quot;
&quot;Lady Nalini, I cannot agree that truth is relative. God's truth is absolute, unchanging. Our understanding of what constitutes god's truth may change because we are flawed humans, we can never know the mind of god.&quot;
I responded &quot;If you set five people to interpret the bible, you will get six interpretations. That does not imply that four or five are wrong. Different people have different levels of understanding.&quot;
Cromwell countered &quot;I thought that was what I was saying? That spiritual babes need spiritual milk, not meat? Many of those in England are spiritual babes, we seek to prevent them from coming into contact with harder fare, lest their lack of understanding lead them into error.&quot;
&quot;Ah, but my point was that you give milk to babes, but stronger food to children and adults. You should not restrict everyone to baby food.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;And you should try to educate those others, and wean them onto stronger food.&quot;
Cromwell nodded thoughtfully. &quot;There is something in what you say. But one must be careful not to confuse the babes with food meant for gown-ups.&quot;
&quot;But please don't fall into the trap of thinking you are at the pinnacle of spiritual understanding. We believe we are ahead of you.&quot;
He smiled quietly &quot;I know you people think that, though I would disagree. Your understanding is different from mine, how does that make yours superior?&quot;
&quot;One example. You don't allow Catholics into your army.&quot; I answered. &quot;We treat them the same as any other person. Why should you disallow them?&quot;
Liz added &quot;And be careful how you answer that.&quot;
He looked thoughtful for a moment. &quot;There are political and religious reasons. Politically, Catholics owe allegiance to their pope, and to catholic countries such as Spain, rather than to England and our kingà&quot;
Prospero interrupted &quot;You have a strange way of showing allegiance to your king. I thought you had deposed him.&quot;
Cromwell smiled sardonically. &quot;You have me there, lord Prosperoà&quot;
&quot;And I thing you will find that most Catholics, like most Jews, are loyal to England before they are loyal to any other country. Allow them freedom of worship here and they will have no need to seek help from other countries.&quot; I interjected.
&quot;But then they would spread their heresies!&quot; Cromwell retorted.
&quot;Which you can rebut by education. You claim the moral high ground, it is up to you to behave in an appropriate mannerà.&quot; I started.
&quot;àIf truth is on your side, then your truth will win over the falsehoods.&quot; Nalini continued. &quot;But if yours be false, then you will not prevail.&quot;
&quot;What have you got against the catholic religion?&quot; Liz asked.
&quot;I believe that the higher principles of Christianity bind all denominations together, but the protestant ones rebelled against the errors of the old catholic faith. The catholic faith is in error, and badly so; it would lead us to hell rather than heaven. But you asked why. Firstly, they have a pope, who is but a man like any other, yet he styles himself god's only representative on earth. Secondly, they worship their saints, in direct contradiction of the Ten Commandments. Thirdly, they claim that Jesus himself must descend from his throne to attend mass across the country, and be present in the wafers in every churchà&quot;
I held up my hand to stop him. &quot;I am sure you have many other reasons, but we should try to answer the points you raise while they are fresh. Liz is the only catholic here, but I think she would explain that Catholics do not worship the saints or Mary, instead ask them to pray with them. Those who think otherwise are in error. There probably are those uneducated people who do think they pray to saints, but they are wrong.&quot;
He held up his hand. &quot;I would reply to that one now. We talked earlier about spiritual babes. My point is that while an educated person may ask the saints to pray with him, and not be committing any error, the practice confuses the uneducated. That is why is should be stopped.&quot;
&quot;And our point was that the uneducated should be educated. I think this point is the big one, all your other ones are matters of dogma and doctrine, and do not affect a person's spiritual wellbeing. Whether Jesus is really present in the wafer should not affect their spirituality, unless somehow you confuse the uneducated into worshiping the host.&quot;
&quot;But they have instructions that communicants cannot chew the wafer!&quot;
Liz responded &quot;They used to be like that, but where we come from that hasn't been the case for at least thirty years or more.&quot;
&quot;I think that there are areas in the catholic faith that need reform. You should be pleased to know that in our own world many of the issues you have either have been or are being addressed. Don't forget there are areas we could find in your own faith that need reform. But the point I wish to make lord Cromwell, is that whether or not you are catholic does not affect your value as a human being. If you see a fellow Christian who believes slightly differently from you, you may point out where the differences are, and why you think the other person is wrong, but it should never be done in anger. It must only be done with love, and compassion. If the other person lacks the level of understanding necessary, then you do not punish them. 'Lord forgive them, for they know not what they do.' You see, we believe that god will judge each of us according to our own beliefs. If you do not know, he will be more lenient than if you know. Compassion is one key that has been lacking from your own religionà&quot;
We ended up having a fairly long lasting discussion. The other puritans left, Matthew came over to join us; he and Cromwell seemed to be good friends. Our discussion ranged over religious dogma, theory and practice of parliamentary government and many other issues. Both Cromwell and Matthew seemed surprised at the many changes in the catholic faith between their society and ours. I know we made ground with Cromwell's attitudes; both he and Matthew did agree that they had been overly severe and lacking in compassion in some of the initiatives they had made while in government. Prospero stayed out of much of the religious discussion, but he joined in enthusiastically when we turned to government.
Our discussion was interrupted by a page who entered the dining room looking for Prospero. They spoke privately for a minute before Prospero announced &quot;Lord Cromwell, it seems your underlings have been arrested. They dropped my name, and the magistrate has requested that I present myself at his court. I think you and lord Matthew should accompany me.&quot;
An annoyed look crossed Cromwell's face, but he nodded. &quot;With what are they charged?&quot;
&quot;I don't know. We must present ourselves at the court to find out. Nothing serious I hope.&quot; He turned to the page. &quot;Tell the magistrate we will be there shortly.&quot; The page ran from the room. Prospero turned to the rest of us &quot;Perhaps you would all like to accompany me? Hopefully this won't take too long, I would hate to miss Durathror's bout with king Amrik later this morning.&quot;
The magistrate's court was not in the palace, but several streets away. We walked. It was a lovely pleasant spring morning, and our way took us past some of the mansions of the nobles with their lavish gardens. The street was paved with large flagstones, and sloped down to the middle, where the drainage gutter ran. All the paved streets of Tarantia have drainage underneath, at periodic intervals the gutters run into the drains underneath the streets. Unlike modern cities, there is no concept of storm-water, gray-water and sewerage, everything drains into the same drain, which of course eventually flows into the Tarantella River. The poorest quarters do not have paved streets, they may have drainage ditches, but some areas simply flood when it rains.
The courthouse was a large building situated facing a square with shops, a fountain where naked nymphs sprayed water on each other and a few people sat in the sun on benches talking with one another. The courthouse was constructed from creamy yellow sandstone and had a slate roof. It was two storied high. We entered through the front door, where Prospero spoke directly with a clerk seated at a desk.
Prospero turned to us and asked &quot;Could you please remain here for a moment?&quot; then followed the clerk down a corridor. The clerk returned a few minutes later and said to me &quot;My lords and ladies, you are requested to follow me.&quot;
We all trooped down the corridor and into a large office. Prospero was talking with a gray-haired man of medium stature. He turned and introduced everyone, then introduced the man. &quot;This is lord Bordano, he is one of the king's magistrates. He is willing to hear the case right now.&quot;
&quot;But with what are they charged?&quot; Cromwell asked.
Lord Bordano looked at Cromwell with a bored expression. &quot;Public uncleanliness. It seems that none of them have bathed for several days. It is a long time since we have heard such a case!&quot; he sniffed. He rang a bell. When a clerk appeared he announced &quot;Have the prisoners for the public uncleanliness charge lead into court room three.&quot;
Cromwell was looking at Matthew with disbelief. Finally he managed &quot;Public uncleanliness? Do you have a law that requires bathing?&quot;
&quot;Oh yes, we do. It may be over a thousand years old, it is seldom used now. Duke Prospero has explained that they are strangers here, I will be lenient. But really, no one has any excuse for not bathing, our public baths are free to all.&quot;
&quot;It is fortunate that you can hear the case on such short notice&quot; I commented.
Lord Bordano shrugged. &quot;We usually do not here a case until a relative of the accused can be present. The drunk and disorderly cases from last night have all been dealt with, save one who is still sleeping in the cells. There are two thieves awaiting a hearing, the watch are searching their homes and talking with the householders who were robbed, I will probably hear them some time this afternoon. This morning is thus free of cases, so it is convenient for me to hear this case now.&quot;
The clerk returned and announced &quot;The prisoners are ready sir.&quot;
&quot;Very good. This way.&quot;
We followed him further along the corridor and into a larger room. The five prisoners were seated on the far side of the room on wooden benches, guarded by three guards in breastplates and carrying pikes. The judge indicated benches in the middle of the room for us to sit upon. He sat upon a chair behind a wooden desk on a raised dais. The clerk handed him a sheet of paper, which he glanced at. He surveyed the assembled people for several seconds before he began to speak. &quot;Prisoners, you have been charged with public uncleanliness. I have a deposition here from several servants at the palace that you have not bathed in the last two days. Do any of you deny the truth of these charges?&quot;
They shook their heads. Lord Bordano continued &quot;What do you have to say for yourselves?&quot;
Tobias managed to say, &quot;Bathing causes disease. 'Tis a well known medical fact.&quot;
Lord Bordano looked at him disdainfully. &quot;Young man&quot; he said sharply &quot;Do not try to lie to me. Dirt causes disease, that is a well known medical fact. A clean body is a healthy body, a clean body is a pure and spiritual body. Do you five have anything to say in your defense? Were you acquainted with the bathing facilities of your accommodation? Speak up!&quot;
They all nodded. He continued &quot;Very well then. I find you all guilty as charged. Now, duke Prospero had informed me you are strangers here. While ignorance of the law is no excuse, he has asked me to be lenient. It is within my powers to order you to be taken to the river, stripped of your clothes, and publicly scrubbed with horse brushes. I can also order you be left naked in stocks in any public square, with a sign to the effect that you are guilty of public uncleanliness. I cannot believe that five educated people do not know the simple facts of bathing. Your body odors cause offence to all around you. You are guilty of wallowing in your filth like pigs. Let me explain something to each of you. I do not care what you do back in the country you come from. For all I care, you may never bathe your entire life. But Aquilonia has a long tradition of civic pride. Citizens take pride in themselves and keep themselves and their city clean. In any large city there are always a few such as yourselves who take it upon themselves to offend their fellows. We have a law that requires a person to bathe daily, and wash their clothes. We do not like a dirty city, we do not like dirty people. Duke Prospero, there are bathing facilities in the palace close to their accommodation?&quot;
&quot;Assuredly, Lord Bordano. They occupy two suites of four bedrooms, each suite has a common sitting area, an office area and a bathroom with a six person bath and a flushing toilet. Servants are available to run baths and scrub backs if necessary.&quot;
&quot;Good. I make the following order. You shall be escorted from here to your place of abode, and there you shall bathe until you are clean. The palace bath servants shall give whatever assistance is required. Once clean, you shall don clean clothes, and you shall each report back here to prove that you are clean. This is to be done before noon. You are further required to bathe daily, and don clean clothes daily. Failure to do so will result in you being rearrested, and charged again. Next time I will order you publicly scrubbed, and if you come before me for a third time, you will spend the day naked in the public square as well. A copy of my judgement will be made available to you as soon as the scribe can write a copy. You may collect it when you return. Guards, would you be so kind as to convey the prisoners to their accommodation and ensure they bathe, then escort them back here? And clerk, please air this room to rid it of the sour odors.&quot; He stood and walked from the room.
&quot;Is that it?&quot; Cromwell asked. We stood and began filing from the room.
Prospero responded &quot;Yes Lord Cromwell, that is it. Provided they obey our laws, there will be no further problem. Are you satisfied with this?&quot;
Cromwell sighed. &quot;It is a strange law, but bathing daily should not be too onerous. We English do not normally bathe daily. The climate is cool, we do not smell. Here is warmer, I will concede that it is necessary to bathe more frequently. But daily bathing? As Tobias said, our physicians tell us that frequent bathing does cause disease.&quot;
Nalini shook her head. &quot;I'm afraid that your physicians are ignorant. Do they also apply leeches?&quot;
Cromwell replied &quot;To the best of my knowledge.&quot;
Nalini continued &quot;I thought so. They believe that too much blood or too much phlegm causes disease. There are other cultures that believe the same, they are severely ignorant though. Disease is caused by minute organisms called germs that are too small to see with the naked eye. Generally they live in filth, garbage, on rats and flies so on. The epidemics of black death that have occurred in the past are due to germs carried by the fleas on rats. Germs are the reason wounds fester. Germs also live in sweat, the dung you pass, and will grow around your back passage if you do not wash after each bowel motion.&quot; Germs would not be a theory until Louis Pasteur more than a century later.
I added &quot;Something else to consider. The Hebrews of the Old Testament certainly knew that filth caused disease. If you read, you will find lots of directives that filth, dead bodies and so on be removed from the camp, and that the Hebrews should wash after handling anything dirty, and prior to eating. The Old Testament Hebrews were much cleaner than you English.&quot;
Cromwell and Matthew looked at one another. Cromwell commented &quot;We must research this.&quot;
Matthew nodded, then remarked &quot;I presume that washing oneself is considered bathing? I did not bathe yesterday, but I did wash.&quot;
Prospero replied &quot;If you washed yourself, then you cleaned yourself. That is the import of the law. It is an old law, I presume it is there for the same reason that the Old Testament laws on cleanliness are there.&quot;
&quot;Oh, undoubtedly&quot; Matthew remarked piously. &quot;I have never heard of these germs, or even that filth caused disease, but if god saw fit to instruct the Hebrews about washing then it must be true. We have obviously misunderstood the import of some parts of scripture. Cromwell you are right, we must research this.&quot;
Cromwell replied &quot;Yes, we must consider what is part of the new covenant, what pertains to the old, and what is god's instructions for good health.&quot; The two of them fell to talking, oblivious to the rest of us.
Prospero said &quot;Danny, I am glad you were able to relate our law back to their scripture. They completely change their attitude once they are convinced that they are somehow contravening their scripture.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, the fight goes out of them. We intend to keep needling them every time they complain about something, if I can think of some scriptural reference. I can't promise that though, my knowledge is limited.&quot;
&quot;Are we gonna have time to see Durathror challenge Amrik?&quot; Paula asked.
&quot;Oh, I certainly hope so. We should swing by the training ground now, and find out if they are there yet.&quot;

Some of the courtiers were already training. Amrik was there, working out with weights, Durathror was performing some slow ballet like movements. Amrik spied us, and called out &quot;Ho, here come the laggards! Are you training today?&quot;
&quot;We have just come from court, where the puritans were tried for public uncleanliness. Is there time for us to change?&quot;
&quot;There is time. How did they take the charges?&quot;
&quot;The five who were charged were meek as lambs, but Cromwell sat through the trial with a face like a thunderclap. They didn't even know that dirt causes disease!&quot;
Amrik shook his head. &quot;Amazing! And they claim to be educated. What happened?&quot;
Prospero chuckled. &quot;The judge ordered them to be bathed, and made it clear that should they appear again he would not be lenient. They were escorted to the baths. Cromwell was not impressed, but then Danny pointed out that their scripture has a passage about the necessity for cleanliness and washing, and suddenly he was a different man. He and Matthew have gone to research the passages in question.&quot;
Amrik lay down on his back on a bench, while two servants carried over a heavy barbell between them. They positioned it behind his head. &quot;You'd better go and change. I will be finished my weights soon.&quot; He proceeded to raise and lower the barbell in an exercise that targeted his bulging triceps.
We changed swiftly, and returned. There were more courtiers there, along with king Charles and the three cavaliers. He was dressed in fencing gear like the others, but since he was limbering up, he wasn't wearing his mask.
Durathror was performing another routine, but this one was several times faster than the other one. There were times when he seemed almost to blur as he moved, and often his feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground. His sword seemed to weave a glittering net. Amrik was making a few practice swipes with his sword. He spotted us and called out &quot;Ho! Join me in some katas.&quot;
Our legs were warm from walking, but Nalini and I took five minutes to limber up the rest of our bodies, then we joined him for three sword katas. Durathror stopped to watch us. When we finished, he remarked &quot;King Amrik, I will teach you some that I know. They will improve your speed.&quot;
Amrik chuckled &quot;If you can beat me, you can teach me!&quot;
Durathror replied &quot;Fair enough! If you beat me, you can teach me! But first, little sister, I would see you in action against Danny.&quot;
So Nalini and I paired off, and for ten minutes we sparred against each other. I think the score was something like seven to five when Durathror stopped us. &quot;You have come a long way from the timid girl who once found her way to my door! I can see you have been practicing. I will teach you all one of my katas later.&quot;
Amrik rumbled &quot;Most of my courtiers find it amazing that a girl can use a sword at all. In my home region, near the border, the women fight alongside their menfolk, and many of them are as good the men. Nalini is better than most of the men I know, she is now one of the finest swordsmen in the kingdom. Well Prince Durathror, shall we start?&quot;
We stood back with the others, while Durathror and Amrik took our place. They seemed ill matched: Durathror is about five foot one and slim, while Amrik is about six foot five with the muscles of a body builder. They both bore similar practice swords, curved sabers with a partial basket hilt. They did not start in the en guard position of fencers, but stood about three meters apart.
At first they circled one another warily. Durathror suddenly tossed his sword from his right hand to his left. As he did so, Amrik attacked ferociously. There was a clatter and glitter of steel, then Durathror was behind Amrik calling &quot;You're dead Amrik!&quot;
They circled again, this time Durathror attacked. His sword was a blur. Surprisingly, he did not meet Amrik's sword, he never seemed to be where Amrik was striking. Every time Amrik struck at him he dodged, and landed his counter attack. It did not matter what Amrik did, Durathror was far too fast for him. Finally Amrik called a halt to the proceedings. &quot;I admit it, I am well and truly outclassed. Never have I seen anyone who could fight like that.&quot; He clapped Durathror on the shoulder.
Durathror smiled graciously. &quot;Don't feel so bad about it king Amrik, I have been practicing every day for over twelve hundred years. You are a superb fighter yourself, you made me work to defeat you. I promise I will train you myself, one day you will be my equal.&quot;
Amrik shook his head ruefully. &quot;I'll never live that long!&quot;
&quot;Oh? You wear a torc now; you will live much longer than normal. Now, who are your best swordsmen? I would fight them all.&quot;
Amrik selected Nalini and myself, Prospero, Rupert and three of his knights whom we did not know. &quot;There are others who are not quite as good as these, but I would say that all of these are on a par with one another.&quot;
We all joined them, and the melee commenced. Eight is about the maximum number of people who can attack an individual, as it is they can get in each other's way. The idea is that they encircle the individual, and all try to attack at once. Durathror never let us completely encircle him, instead he always took the attack to one of us, and then broke through the circle. We stopped the fight after fifteen minutes feeling rather frustrated, and all of us sporting bruises from hits by Durathror.
&quot;I felt two hits during the entire fight. If I am not mistaken, both of them were from Nalini. So, between all of you, I have met my match.&quot; He was smiling.
&quot;I didn't think I actually touched you.&quot; Nalini responded.
&quot;Oh I felt your energies Nalini. You are the only one I have trained, you are the only one who has some idea about my fighting techniques.&quot;
Amrik turned to the assembled audience. &quot;Fight's over boys and girls. You can go back to your training now.&quot;
Durathror taught the eight of us one of his katas. The form is different from kendo katas, there are more body movements, and when done by Durathror, the sword weaves a net of light. Durathror explained &quot;These are the advanced forms, I will only teach them to someone who is already an excellent swordsman. Now, let me show you the butterfly kata.&quot;
He picked up a second sword, and then launched into his butterfly kata. His body seemed almost to whirl like a dervish, while the two swords spun a silver web. Several times during the kata he sprang, flying several meters each time. When he finished, he commented &quot;There are twenty seven other katas you should learn before you move up to using two swords. You should practice each one for at least a year to master it and only then should you learn the next one. I have taught you the first one, I will correct your practice of it while I am here. The idea is to increase the speed at which you perform it, until you reach a point where I am satisfied.&quot;
After this, we returned to more normal practice. Amrik went to spar with today's group of soldiers. Nalini and I dispensed with swords, and went to unarmed forms. We also supervised Paula and Liz's training. Prospero and Rupert fenced with each other, and seemed evenly matched. King Charles acquitted himself reasonably well against king Amrik's knights. He was good enough to beat a number of them, and seemed quite pleased with himself.
It was only when we were finishing that we noticed Cromwell and Matthew standing back amongst the hangers on. They were easily spotted by their distinctive hats. Liz referred to them as &quot;circling vultures&quot;
Cromwell moved over to king Charles and commented &quot;You majesty, please allow me to complement you on your prowess with a sword.&quot;
Charles smiled sweetly. &quot;So today I am your majesty? Should I draw hope from that? I am pleased with my fencing. In England, when I trained, I know my instructors and training partners would let me win. I never knew whether my skills were adequate, good or bad. I have seen that these cavaliers show no deference to their own king when they fence with him. Today I fenced on my own merits against cavaliers who were determined to defeat me. I won more bouts than I lost, so I am happy. I know I can improve, having seen his majesty king Amrik in action I feel that I should improve my skills as much as I am able.&quot;
Cromwell replied slowly &quot;You have always been my king, even when I lead the parliament to vote for your forced abdication. I will not lie, I put god and England before your own welfare, but I voted against your outlawry and its attendant death sentence. I believe now that we might find an honorable path through our problems.&quot;
Charles studied Cromwell for several moments. &quot;You are uncommonly mellow. What has caused this?&quot;
Cromwell smiled ruefully. &quot;Let us say the scales have fallen from my eyes. I have always tried to act in accordance with god's holy word, as revealed in his scriptures. But several times in the past few days god has used earl Danny as an instrument to reveal that my understanding of the bible has been flawed. I realize that some of the things that have happened are contrary to god's intentions and proscriptions. As a man of god, I now seek to rectify those lapses. I believe that this is best done with your cognizance and participation.&quot;
At that point they walked out of earshot. I mentioned what I had overheard to Prospero. &quot;It does sound promising. Would you and Nalini be able to attend this afternoon's session?&quot;
That afternoon Nalini and I sat in as representatives of the people of England. We were hampered by not knowing enough about the situation of the people of England, but both of us have fairly strong ideas about equality for all, and took a stand against privilege. In our own cultures we are probably representative of mainstream thought, but in England of the mid seventeenth century we were quite extreme, and managed to offend both Cromwell and king Charles.
We pushed for a House of Commons, a parliament where the ordinary people would have a voice. Cromwell wanted his House of Lords, a parliament of nobles, but not a House of Commons. King Charles wanted neither.
Cromwell wanted the king to have no real powers, similar to the Westminster model, where the king can summon and pirogue parliament and sign laws, but does little else. Here we aligned with Prospero in pushing for more of an American model, with the president replaced by a hereditary king.
Cromwell became quite heated about despotic kings, I countered with &quot;And under your model, who will curb the powers of despotic nobles? Who will give voice to the ordinary people, and prevent the abuse of privilege that has gone on for thousands of years?&quot;
King Charles countered with &quot;But why should the commoners have a voice? They are uneducated, selfish, they know nothing of the government of the country.&quot;
Nalini jumped in with &quot;And what about the nobles fencing in the commons so the ordinary people can no longer graze their cattle? What about the privilege that says only the king may hunt deer? What about the law that says that a farmer may not kill the hare that eats his cabbage? Is that fair? It's time both of you got off your pedestals and started looking after the ordinary people. Forget this talk about rights, and start discussing obligations. Obligations like ensuring that people have enough to eat, are not thrown off their land, have peace to bring up their families without wars. Both of you failed dismally! Both of you abused your sacred trusts!&quot;
I added, &quot;Why do you think Jesus hung around with ordinary people? Why do you think he washed the feet of his disciples?&quot;
Both Charles and Cromwell looked angry. Charles commented &quot;We are back to this again? It has always been the king's right to hunt deer...&quot;
&quot;And allow the ordinary people to starve? Or should they kill a deer to feed their starving families, you make them criminals and outlaws?&quot; Nalini spat back. &quot;Your obligation is to ensure they do not starve! Otherwise you are guilty of murder, just as surely as if you had cut their heads off.&quot;
Prospero tried to smooth things over. &quot;These are minor points, but do serve to illustrate the obligations of the government.&quot;
Cromwell commented &quot;I for one do not hunt, I do not approve of it. But I am inclined to agree with princess Nalini, that when people are starving, they should be allowed to hunt for food. But please tell me earl Danny, why did Jesus wash the feet of his disciples?&quot;
&quot;'The first shall be last.' Remember? He did not stand on his rights, but showed that everyone has obligations to look after their fellows. Washing people's feet was an obligation in the Holy Land, where there were no paved roads, and everyone entered a house with dirty feet. Every household had to provide someone to wash the feet of visitors, but of course usually it would be a lowly servant. Jesus showed that everyone must fulfil their obligations, and not pass it off to someone else. That a king or the Son of God is not above ordinary people, and has the same obligations as everyone else. But you two would set yourselves above others, as their betters. You are not their betters, they are yours!&quot;
Charles looked angry, but Cromwell looked as if he was chewing this over. &quot;You have a way of putting things in a different light. We should aspire to emulate the Son of God, even though we know we are not perfect.&quot;
&quot;All people should be equal before the law, instead of one law for the rich, and one for the poor. If a noble commits a crime, his punishment should be no less than would be meted out to a commoner. But the commoners must have their voice, otherwise the king and nobles will ride roughshod over them as they always have. Any law must be assented to by the king, by the House of Lords, and by the House of Commons. That way, each party provides a check upon the powers of the others.&quot;
Charles protested &quot;But the commoners are uneducated and self interested!&quot;
Nalini and I both laughed. &quot;How is that different from the nobles or the king?&quot;
&quot;Nobles at least have some training in the good order of their estates.&quot;
&quot;King Charles, do you want to be a figurehead as Cromwell would have you? Under this arrangement, you are still king, you can still make laws, but the two parliaments must assent to those laws. That protects against the king making unjust laws. But equally, any law that either house passes must gain royal assent as well. You have the right to modify it and send it back for reconsideration.&quot;
We argued round in circles for a while. Cromwell became an early convert, seeing the wisdom of checks and balances; Charles held out for a time. But he could not suggest alternatives that did not involve giving the king despotic powers, or doing away with most of the checks and balances. Prospero spoke at some length about how what we were proposing was similar to what Aquilonia was in the process of setting up, and did a good job of cutting off lines of discussion that lead too far away from the main topic.
When we broke for refreshments, he talked things over with Imladril and Durathror, then came to sit with the rest of us. &quot;I am not happy with your proposal, but I agree that at least I am still king, even if parliament must assent to my laws. Cromwell would have me restored as a figurehead only. Cromwell, if you will support lord Danny's proposal, then I will also.&quot;
Cromwell nodded. &quot;I have misgivings about the House of Commons, but I feel that it is in accord with Jesus' teachings. We do have an obligation to look after the commoners as well. If you will be king under this model, then I will agree to your restoration.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;Good! You will be able to have extensive dialogs with us about how we organize it, and the problems we encounter. We could learn from each others' experiences.&quot;
After refreshments, Prospero called in another lord who was involved in setting up the process for parliamentary government, and the two of them spoke in turns about how they were organizing things.
 Later, Prospero invited Imladril and Durathror with their partners to his apartment for drinks. We discussed the day's negotiations. Paula commented &quot;Hey, it sounds like they've agreed!&quot;
Prospero shook his head. &quot;This is just the first hurdle. There are forty seven points to be negotiated, this was point one. It is the biggest, that I grant, but I always thought they would agree in principle. It is a compromise between what Cromwell originally wanted, and what the king originally wanted, and does not compromise Cromwell's religious principles. The other points are smaller, they will be harder to compromise on. But it is a significant day.&quot;
Imladril agreed with Prospero &quot;The biggest point is often the easiest to gain agreement on. The minor details are where negotiations usually come unstuck. Cromwell is quite easy to manipulate, as long as we relate what we want back to his religious principles.&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;Yes, once he sees that there is a religious argument in favor of our point, he acquiesces. I just hope we can continue to find such points.&quot;
Durathror commented &quot;Well, between Danny and I we should be able to. Now, how do we manipulate the king?&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;That is harder. He has gained his main wish, which is to be restored to the throne. But I believe that he will probably lose interest in the remaining negotiations, it will be mainly Cromwell we will have to convince.&quot;
Iskandor chuckled &quot;I will wager Charles will be scheming how to turn things around once he is restored, and do away with Cromwell.&quot;
&quot;He will, but I think even he realizes he would precipitate another civil war&quot; Imladril observed.
&quot;He might.&quot; Prospero conceded. &quot;We know that Cromwell's supporters won't go away, but will the king realize that? A docile Cromwell is the key to restoring peace to England.&quot;
&quot;But this is where the protocols and guarantees come in.&quot; Imladril commented. &quot;We must turn our thoughts to this in the not too distant future, otherwise all out efforts will be undone within weeks of their return to England.&quot;
&quot;Weren't we going to send some sort of monitoring force - a bit like the UN peace keeping forces?&quot; I wondered.
&quot;Yes, but we need to work out how many people it needs, where they will be stationed, what their duties are, and guidelines for them.&quot; Imladril responded.
Prospero added &quot;We also need someone senior to head it up, and we need to open an embassy, and negotiate closer links with England.&quot;
Imladril commented &quot;We will need a senior sorcerer, otherwiseà&quot;
Durathror interrupted &quot;I have already volunteered to head up the diplomatic mission. I know something of their shadow, I have lived in similar ones, I am known to both Cromwell and the king, I understand the negotiations, and I will take no nonsense from either of them. I don't see a problem. I will take volunteers with me, and I will keep them to their promises. I am almost looking forward to it.&quot;
&quot;Except they will probably try to burn us as sorcerers.&quot; Ra'anor observed. &quot;I have begun to like the civilized things we can get in shadows such as Danny's and Nalini's.&quot;
&quot;We will still go visiting. But someone has to oversee the implementation of this. By rights it should be Prospero, but he is not sorcerer enough to handle it yet.&quot; He turned to Prospero. &quot;I expect you to volunteer.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I expect I will be our first ambassador to England. Amrik will complain, but I am the most suited. Once the initial set up is over, we can leave it to others. I wish to develop trade and cultural links.&quot;
&quot;I don't wish to be the one to pick holes, but once they find out you are not protestant, they will probably cut you dead.&quot; I observed. &quot;Cromwell is going to discover this very soon. He will want to attend church, probably even tomorrow, I think that is their Sunday, and if he watches the wedding he'll know for sure. What happens then?&quot;
&quot;We'll deal with that when it happens.&quot; Prospero replied. &quot;He has to learn religious tolerance. If he proves to be too much of a nuisance, we might not let him back. We'll have to play it by ear I think.&quot;
&quot;What's happened about the civil war and the witch persecutions?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Oh, that was settled in the first negotiations. Cromwell will dismantle the witch persecutions, and declare a cease-fire. With king Charles being restored to the throne, this makes it all the more palatable to the royalists. We still have to discuss things like pardons for all the executed, restitution of their property and so on, but they are other points of negotiation.&quot;
 That evening, there was no official banquet. Durathror invited all of us to a restaurant he knew off in shadow. He extended the invitation to Enyil and Amrik, who accepted with alacrity. Instead of sending a servant back to inform us, they came themselves. Amrik announced &quot;'Twill be a relief to quit the palace for a night! I swear Prospero, had I know what was in store for me as king, I would never have accepted the crown!&quot;
&quot;Why do you think I refused it?&quot; Prospero responded with a laugh.
&quot;Hah! Some friend! Still, at least it stopped a civil war, and prevented the crown from falling into the hands of one of those brigands that have the cheek to call themselves noble. Tonight I can be plain Amrik. Do I need my sword?&quot;
&quot;No friend Amrik,&quot; Durathror replied &quot;It will attract unwelcome attention.&quot;
Amrik unbuckled his sword, and placed it on the floor underneath a low table. &quot;I feel undressed now.&quot;
Prince Rupert asked, &quot;Should we invite king Charles?&quot;
Amrik made a face, but said nothing. Prospero replied &quot;No, I have arranged other entertainment for him. He will undoubtedly be happier being the center of attention anyway. He doesn't strike me as being the sort of person who enjoys blending into the crowd.&quot;
&quot;You are right there.&quot; Rupert responded. &quot;I thought merely that if he was in his rooms he would prefer to come with us.&quot;
Prospero smiled &quot;Charles and my mother seem to enjoy one another's company, and she will certainly treat him like a visiting dignitary. I have made sure that he will not want for entertainment while he is with us. Your three cavalier friends I have found a party of knights who seem to suit them, and there are ladies of the court who are interested in keeping them company as well.&quot; He grinned broadly. &quot;Had you not struck up a friendship with Liz, I would have organized something similar for you.&quot;
Rupert blushed, but replied in a courtly manner &quot;I thank you Prospero, but yes, I enjoy the company of the lady Elizabeth, and I enjoy the company of those of you here. I am certainly not bored.&quot;
&quot;The puritans are more of a problem, since they do not appreciate the entertainments that the others do. My spies tell me that tonight Cromwell will conduct a bible study class for them, so they are catered for as well.&quot;
Durathror lead us from Prospero's apartments and down the stairs leading to the outside. Liz asked &quot;How do your spies understand English?&quot;
Enyil replied &quot;I have set a translation spell upon them. They can understand anything that is spoken, it helps them to understand biblical references, but they cannot read Cromwell's journal.&quot;
I asked, &quot;What else do the puritans do with themselves?&quot;
&quot;Mostly they talk amongst themselves.&quot; Prospero responded. &quot;Cromwell writes a journal each evening, he and Matthew spend time studying the bible. My spies can understand much of that, because they discuss the bible between them. They were all being visited by those beings that masqueraded as their gods, they all saw Durathror unmask them as demons, and now they have doubts about any divine revelation. But it does seem that the seeds you planted are bearing fruit. They study the bible, and find passages that support the point of view you have been expressing. Cromwell and Matthew at least seem to have decided they were wrong, and that the bible supports your view, so now they are finding new strength for a campaign to right the wrongs they unleashed. It does seem quite hopeful.&quot;
Nalini chuckled &quot;I suppose you can't just line them up with a girl for the night, you can't take them out drinking or eating or dancing. What can you do with them?&quot;
&quot;There are some tours of the city that we're arranging. They won't play board gamesà&quot;
&quot;But they might play chess.&quot; I interrupted.
Prospero nodded. &quot;I have several chess sets, I will see if they are interested. I must confess I have been guilty of not arranging as many entertainments for them because I don't know what entertainments to arrange.&quot;
Durathror conjured a light, and lead us across the castle lawns. We shifted rapidly through several darkened gardens before we came to a street with streetlights. Durathror extinguished his light, and lead us through a number of suburban and city streets. After about fifteen minutes, we arrived in some well-lit ornamental gardens. Nalini and I had been trying to detect the shadows Durathror selected, but to no avail, they were too distant for us.
We crossed a small bridge over a stream, and came to a sprawling restaurant. It consisted of a number of areas spread through the gardens, lit by floating globes that shed a soft white light over the scene. Each area was a differently themed garden. We were led to an area with exotic night blooming flowers that gave off a heady scent. There were flagstones underfoot, but the night air was mild. The waiters dragged several tables together so we could all see one another and talk.
The menu was a thick illustrated book, but Durathror waved it away. &quot;We will have a banquet, just be sure to include some vegetarian dishes, and a selection of wines to accompany each dish.&quot; The waiter departed.
Nalini and I glanced through the menu. There seemed to be thousands of pictures, the dishes seemed to run a whole gamut of known styles, plus many we did not recognize. The writing made no sense to me. It had the look of an alphabet with flowing symbols that were grouped to form words.
Durathror explained &quot;There are far to many dishes to ever make sense of. I think even Prospero could eat here for ten years and never have the same dish twice! They have many banquets; the banquets always include a selection of their more popular dishes.&quot;
&quot;So where are we?&quot; Liz asked.
Several of us chuckled, the question did not make sense to shadow shifters. Durathror replied &quot;I do not know the name of this land, nor can I speak their language, let alone read their writing. Korum stumbled across this one day, and then showed me how to find it. What I do know of it is that the art of shadow walking is known in this shadow, and they trade with other shadows. Sorcery abounds here. They have some technology they have collected from journeys to other shadows. If you look around, you will see that not all people here are human.&quot;
Some distance over was a table with creatures that bore a resemblance to preying mantises. I had no idea what they were eating, and probably no desire to find out either. Rupert's jaw fell open when he spied them. &quot;I see what you mean.&quot; He stammered. &quot;Would they eat food like us?&quot;
Ra'anor answered &quot;They have a menu devoted to their own peculiar tastes. I think they like their food live. We've seen others like them here before, though neither of us is sure what shadow they come from.&quot;
&quot;This could be an interesting place to stay for a while&quot; Nalini commented. &quot;It seems reasonably civilized, they accept people like us. I would like to come back here one day for some holidays.&quot; I agreed; to us new civilizations are interesting. We enjoy exploring and living in new ones, but preferably ones where we are not in danger.
Prospero commented &quot;I will have to come back here. The idea that I could eat here every day for ten years without ever having the same dish sounds like my idea of heaven!&quot;
Paula responded &quot;Well, why don't the four of us come here for some holidays? Durathror, how far is this from Aquilonia? I mean for me and Prospero?&quot; Then she turned to Liz and apologized &quot;Sorry Liz, you have to come too. It's just that you can't shadow shift yet.&quot;
Liz made a half smile. &quot;It's okay, I've been tagging along with Danny and Nalini, so that's why you forgot me. Just don't make a habit of it huh?&quot;
Durathror cut in &quot;Liz, you are always welcome to tag along with Ra'anor and myself as well. Once you learn to shadowshift, you will be able to invite us to visit places you've discovered. Now Paula, this place would probably take you about five or six hours to reach from Aquilonia, and probably longer from your home. Danny and Nalini could probably take half that time or less, but they are still developing their powers too. We'll bring you back here evenings when Amrik doesn't have any official banquets scheduled.&quot;
&quot;There's none tomorrow night either.&quot; Amrik put in. &quot;I'd be happy to come back here again. Can we wander the gardens later?&quot;
The food began to arrive. There was finger food reminiscent of a yum cha, there were dishes of vegetables prepared a dozen different ways, there were spiced meats and things we couldn't recognize. Most of the dishes seemed to be simple combinations prepared to highlight the individual flavors of the ingredients. Different wines were served or each dish, some of them with quite novel flavors. Nalini ordered a side serving of raw chili, just in case she decided the dishes were too bland for her tastes.
Rupert asked one of the waiters about the strange creatures. The waiter replied &quot;Oh, we cater for the sentient races from all thirty one aethyrs. Those are byroni, I think they are from the eleventh aethyr, but I'm not sure.&quot;
&quot;Have you visited any of the other aethyrs?&quot; Nalini inquired.
&quot;No ma'am, though one day I hope to. I get to meet many travelers in this job, some of the aethyrs sound marvelous.&quot;
&quot;Thirty one?&quot; I remarked once he had departed. &quot;He didn't call them shadows either, he used the word aethyr.&quot;
Durathror shook his head. &quot;We heard it in our native tongue, he used an archaic term for the spirit world, but in plural.&quot;
Amrik commented to Prospero &quot;I thought he called them celestial spheres or something like that?&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;Yes, I thought he used an ancient poetic reference to the abode of the gods: the celestial spheres.&quot;
Paula commented &quot;I heard him use the word dimensions; he said there were thirty one dimensions.&quot;
Liz looked at the rest of us, then said &quot;I heard him say thirty one planes, it made sense to me.&quot;
Rupert looked around slowly. &quot;Magic. I have always been taught to fear it. But I have no other word to refer to the face that he speaks his native language, and I hear him speak my native German. To me he used a term that I would render in English as aethyr. Queen Elizabeth's astrologer Dr. John Dee used the term to refer to the spiritual realms inhabited by different kinds of angels. Why thirty one?&quot;
Imladril hazarded a guess &quot;It may be that they have easy travel between thirty one shadows, as we refer to them. The rest of you, if you will observe around you, and count, there are thirty one shadows that stand out as close, very close in fact. I suspect that with a little training, anyone could travel to these. The barriers between them are thinner than normal. I agree with Nalini, I think it would be interesting to visit these shadows, and learn about them. They obviously trade and travel freely between them.&quot;
Normally when I activate my sorcerer's senses to detect and sift shadows, I have a sense of reaching out to find those closest to me. Here, opening my shadow senses I immediately felt as if a number of shadows were crowding around me and touching me. If anything they obscured those more distant. I counted twenty nine the first time, and thirty two the second.
Durathror reached across to Liz, took her hand. &quot;Here Liz, let me loan you some energy. See if you can detect anything.&quot;
She sat back, shut her eyes, and was quiet for a time. Finally she remarked &quot;I get the impression of a lake, and a separate impression of red earth and green trees, and I think there are others, but they all jumbled up.&quot;
&quot;Good, good! You can sense them. After dinner, we might take you on a short trip through the ones nearest so you can see how many you could gain impressions of.&quot;
Rupert shook his head sadly. &quot;I am afraid it is all a mystery to me.&quot;
Ra'anor remarked &quot;With training, you will be able to sense the other shadows, and one day you will also be able to travel as we do. For now, you must try to find any of us in your dreams. Once you can accomplish this then we can teach you more. You should come with Liz later, so that you know what is nearby.&quot;
He nodded. &quot;Thank you lady Ra'anor, I would appreciate that. I must admit I am fascinated by these other realms, these aethyrs as he termed them.&quot;
The food was tasty. Some of it was savory, some of it was sweet, some of it was highly spiced. Nalini and I threw away our vegetarian principles and sampled dishes with flesh in them. Many of the flavors are indescribable, simply because I have never tasted them before. There were twelve of us, and I think they had allowed four dishes per person. This meant we had forty eight different dishes to share between us, although the quantities we had of each were small. Prospero was definitely in gourmet heaven.
The wines were a good accompaniment to the dishes, and were as varied. There was a pale lavender wine that had a floral scent and taste, but with spicy overtones, another one was pale pink with a citrus scent and quite a dry finish. Another had a peppery peppermint taste, while another honey colored wine burned like horseradish or chili. That one wasn't so popular, though Nalini liked it. We did not have forty eight bottles of wine, had we done so, most of us would have been too drunk to find our way home, and some might have had to be carried. Interestingly enough, one bottle that contained an almost clear wine with slight blue overtones, and tasted like a mixture of orange and cinnamon, did not seem to contain alcohol, but a stimulant drug of some kind. After half a glass of that I was wide awake.
Amrik commented &quot;Seems a waste of good alcohol. I drink enough to become mellow, and this cancels it out. Hey Prospero, maybe we should take some back to drink during the day instead of coffee?&quot; Amrik would drink coffee, but had never taken to it the way that Prospero had.
Durathror observed &quot;Amrik, I don't think this sobers you up, it just makes you a wide awake drunk.&quot;
&quot;Ah, now that is all right then. I would hate to think I would have to start all over again.&quot;
Nalini commented at large &quot;I think we should probably go easy on this one, we don't know what its affects are.&quot;
I beckoned to a waiter, and asked her. &quot;Oh, that is brewed from the coca plant, you should not drink more than one glass, because you will be awake all night. One bottle should be ample between all of you. But if you do all want to stay awake until morning, I can bring you another one.&quot;
&quot;No, one will suffice. Just out of interest, do you have any other drinks that have other than alcohol in them?&quot;
&quot;Yes, but you have to ask for them specifically. We only serve enough coca for half a glass per guest unless they request more.&quot;
&quot;So what ones do you have? We are not familiar with your wines.&quot;
&quot;Oh, sorcerers, I understand. Erm, we have five other wines, three will make you see visions, one is made from cactus, one from mushrooms, and one from a white flower. The other two are tranqs, they will mellow you out and calm you down. One is made from the sap of a small red flower, the other is made from the seeds of the black lotus.&quot;
&quot;Thanks, I think we'll give them a miss this time.&quot;
Amrik turned to Prospero. &quot;Black lotus? Isn't that the drug surgeons use when they must cut people?&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;I believe so. I suspect the juice of the red flower is probably opium poppies, I think we should leave them both alone.&quot;
Imladril remarked &quot;I think we should leave all of them alone. I do not approve of general consumption of drugs.&quot;
Rupert was puzzled. &quot;I think I have missed something...&quot;
&quot;There is a right time and place for the use of drugs.&quot; Imladril explained. &quot;The black lotus and the red poppy both produce drugs that put you to sleep, or in lesser doses will deaden pain. If you have to go under a surgeon's knife, then you can sleep while they cut and sew, or you can have the pain of your wounds dulled.&quot;
Rupert asked &quot;Is that the red poppy that grows back home? I don't think any physicians or apothecaries know about it, as far as I am aware we have nothing to deaden pain, and nothing to make you sleep while a surgeon cuts.&quot;
&quot;I think it might be. The sap of the flower bulb is collected. When we return you, I will have a look. If it is, I can teach you or some physicians you select how to prepare and administer it. But both are addictive, if you use them too often, or in too high a dosage, then you will suffer pains if you do not take them. They also impair your sorcerous abilities; you won't be able to shadow shift while under their influence. Coca I am not so familiar with, it is a much stronger stimulant than coffee, as the girl explained, one glass of that wine and you will be awake all night. That in itself is bad, you need to sleep to recuperate, staying awake all night will harm your body and discolor your energies. But what we have had is probably no worse than strong coffee. The other three stimulate your sorcerous abilities; they should only be used under supervision of a sorcerer. You can stray into all sorts of trouble if you have wild flickerings of sorcerous powers.&quot;
 After dinner, Durathror and Ra'anor took Liz and Rupert for a tour of the nearby shadows while the rest of us went for a walk through the gardens. Imladril was interested in our assessment of Rupert and Liz's relationship. &quot;She needs a man either to train her or to train with her. Rupert could fill that need; he has the potential to be a sorcerer.&quot;
&quot;They seem to get on well,&quot; Nalini offered &quot;but I think both of them have some prejudices to get over. She thinks he's only attracted to her because of her skin color, he will probably want a noble wife to fit into their society.&quot;
&quot;Like Prospero you mean.&quot; Imladril replied. &quot;Prospero and Rupert are similar. Both are expected to marry some noblewoman for reasons of property rather than love and compatibility. Prince Rupert has a title, but he is not the eldest son, he will never inherit a throne, and he has little money of his own. He is not the catch that Prospero is, with his large estates and being next in line to the throne.&quot;
&quot;If I might make an observation&quot; Prospero ventured &quot;Prince Rupert has a better temperament than the others. He is educated, self-assured, a general at the age of twenty four, yet he has an open mind and does not seem to be prejudiced. He also has an interest in science and engineering. He and I have a lot in common. I think if he will learn sorcery, then he will suit Liz very well.&quot;
&quot;But will Liz suit him?&quot; Nalini asked. &quot;Prospero, you and Paula have the same skin color, so the question does not arise. But Liz is dark, she has come in for some prejudice and abominable treatment when she was younger. Also Prospero, I have noticed that Aquilonia does have a few nobles with brown skin, you people don't seem to have color prejudice...&quot;
&quot;No, we don't Nalini. The people to the north tend to be pale skinned, the people to the south tend to be darker skinned. Our southern neighbors are quite dark, they look African and Indian; we have traded and intermarried with them for hundreds of years. Do you mean that Rupert's society is all pale skins? And they are prejudiced against those who are darker?&quot;
&quot;Prince Rupert has never seen people with dark skins until he met us.&quot; Nalini explained. &quot;I don't think he is prejudiced simply because he has never learned he should be. But the Christian culture of that time saw everything in terms of good and evil, white and black. White is seen as good, black as evil. I think you will find that there are already African slaves being shipped to the Americas. Liz will encounter prejudice in the England or Germany of Prince Rupert. It probably won't be as bad as some things she has already encountered, but she has a poor impression of most whites. She has trouble trusting most of them, and she has trouble trusting most males, black or white.&quot;
Imladril looked hard at Nalini, then remarked &quot;Oh. I understand. But Prince Rupert is a gentleman, he is polite and will respect her wishes. He will be part of her healing. I think I should talk with her myself, and see if she is in need of any healing from me. You all are also part of her healing, she is learning that she can trust people outside her family. Fine, let's leave it for now. We will train Rupert if he qualifies, and we will put him together with Liz when we can. Liz may need healing before things develop. Otherwise it will be up to the two of them.&quot;
The gardens themselves were extensive; we did not tour more than a small percentage of them. My impressions were that the restaurant extended through a large part of the gardens, but many areas catered for guests from other aethyrs with different eating habits. Most of the plants in the areas we visited were night blooming, no doubt because most of the patrons ate there at night.
We did pass close to an area where the Byroni, the preying mantis like creatures, were eating. They were probably about four feet or one meter high, but their bodies would have been almost seven meters or twenty five feet long, and mainly colored a brilliant emerald green. Each creature had slightly different colored markings on their backs and thoraxes, flecks of red or gold about the size of coins. Their huge compound eyes reflected the light like polished gems the size of bowling balls. They did not sit, but stood on their four rear legs, torsos raised, and ate from a table that must have been at least two meters from the ground. The three closest to us were dining on live blue-green lobster-like crustaceans the size of dogs, chewing bits off in their sideways working jaws while their dinner struggled to escape.
We looked, we couldn't help ourselves. One of the creatures passed comment to another &lt;&lt;Stupid humans staring.&gt;&gt;
Another commented &lt;&lt;Should ban them when we're eating.&gt;&gt;
Imladril bowed and replied &lt;&lt;Your pardons, noble creatures. We are travelers, we have been rude. We humbly apologize. We will let you eat in peace.&gt;&gt;
One of the creatures replied &lt;&lt;Ah! Sorcerers! You can speak as we do. You are not from the thirty one aethyrs then?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, we have journeyed some distance to visit here. This is the first of the aethyrs we have visited.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;You should visit them all. This one is nice, as are many others, but our own is especially magnificent.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Thank you, we will be sure to visit there. Enjoy your meal.&gt;&gt; We continued on.
&lt;&lt;Oh, we are! These &lt;unknown symbol&gt; have been specially fed to improve their taste!&gt;&gt; One thought after us.
Amrik asked &quot;Are there many odd creatures like that? I shall think twice next time I squash a bug in the garden, lest it have relatives like that!&quot;
Enyil laughed gently. &quot;Amrik my love, it is likely they do not care for bugs in your garden any more than we do. You saw what they ate. But sentience does not always come in human form.&quot;
&quot;Do you think they would eat us?&quot; he wondered aloud.
&quot;Maybe not. Would you consider eating one of them? We are probably just as repulsive to them as they are to us.&quot;
&quot;I hadn't thought of it like that. I never dreamed such things could exist.&quot;
Nalini observed &quot;It might do the puritans good to visit these shadows. They need to realize they aren't god's chosen.&quot;
&quot;Travel broadens the mind? But that implies they have minds to broaden. I thought theirs were completely closed off.&quot;
&quot;Cromwell seems to have a partly open mind.&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;I have been thinking of taking them on a tour of sorts. Iskandor and I could take them to see some real wonders tomorrow.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;I thought that Cromwell was going to visit one of our temples tomorrow.&quot;
&quot;Well, that will not take all day Prospero! If they visit early, we can go travelling immediately afterwards. Let them pass comments about sorcery, and we might even show them a thing or two.&quot; Her green eyes flashed, and I remembered her comment about breaking them like horses.
Prospero replied &quot;There is a service at dawn, in honor of the rising sun, a second at noon and a third at sunset. We could bring them in not long after the sunrise service.&quot;
&quot;Just be sure that you don't have lots of statues around.&quot; I commented. &quot;It's likely to upset them.&quot;
Imladril compressed her lips, looking suddenly dangerous. &quot;All the better. Show them your temple. If that offends them, then we shall arrange for their education.&quot;
&quot;Should you invite king Charles as well?&quot; Amrik asked.
Imladril thought for a moment. &quot;Yes, perhaps we should. He is in need of some education as well.&quot;
&quot;Will this alienate them and make them angry, or will this make them open there eyes and see what bigots they've been?&quot; I wasn't so sure that antagonizing them was a good idea.
Imladril looked at me and smiled. &quot;Danny, how would you train an animal? You expose it to the behavior you want, and you praise and reward that behavior. You expose it to situations where it exhibits unwanted behavior, and you scold it. A horse must be accustomed to the bridle and saddle, and to having someone sit upon its back before you can begin teaching it to respond to command. We will accustom them to things they find unpleasant, just like a horse is trained. None of you who are involved in the negotiations should come with us, we don't want them to blame you for their situation.&quot;
Iskandor remarked &quot;We should discuss this tonight with Durathror to decide where we should lead them tomorrow.&quot;
In another part of the garden, we spied tall angel like beings with large wings covered with white feathers. The beings all had shoulder length white hair, pale golden skins, and deep barrel chests. Their faces were human, but suffused with a haughty demeanor. They ignored us.
&quot;This is an interesting set of shadows!&quot; Prospero exclaimed. &quot;Do you think they can fly?&quot;
&quot;Maybe, their chests look big enough for flight muscles.&quot; I replied. &quot;It will depend on what they weigh, but I would guess they weigh much less than we do.&quot;
Prospero remarked &quot;I envy Liz and Rupert, being taken on a guided tour.&quot;
Imladril answered &quot;You two should be able to devise your own tour. These shadows are easy enough to shift through.&quot;
&quot;Maybe I could take a few of you here tomorrow for some site seeing?&quot; Enyil offered. &quot;That is of course if you do not have any other plans, Amrik my love.&quot;
&quot;I am sick of state occasions. We have a big one in a few days time when we marry, I think I would like to do a little wandering and exploring tomorrow, anything that will take me away from the palace, and where I will not be recognized.&quot;
&quot;Then you and I will come here to go site seeing. We will take Prospero and Paula with us, and Danny and Nalini if they like. Just the six of us.&quot;
Amrik grinned &quot;Just like old times. Let's do it!&quot;

The next day we all rose early, breakfasted, and left the region we'd taken to calling the thirty one aethyrs. Nalini and I went with Prospero, Paula, Enyil and Amrik. Liz and Rupert were doing a similar tour, but in company with Durathror and Ra'anor who would also be training them. I'm not sure whether Rupert actually realized he was going to receive some fundamental training.
One day is not sufficient to do more than touch the surface, since we could spend little more than half an hour in each one. I think you can imagine spending only half an hour in each of the world's capital cities, and you will begin to understand the magnitude of the problem. Nalini and I resolved to journey back there at a later date and spend some time just holidaying and exploring.
Each of the aethyrs is different, with different sentient creatures living there, and quite different landscapes. I have no idea whether what we saw holds true for the entire shadow, or just for the parts we visited. After all, our own shadow earth has quite different landscapes.
Each shadow making up the thirty one aethyrs passes through some of the others. If you visit a point of intersection, anyone with a little guidance and training can shift between the shadows, without a torc. Even Amrik had no trouble detecting the intersecting shadows and moving between them. The denizens of these shadows can move freely between them at these points of intersection, and trade and travel between the aethyrs is frequent.
The intersection points are relatively stable, in that they have mostly remained in the same place for hundreds of years. However, some intersections drift slowly around, others fade out, and new ones form. Each intersection is between only two shadows, and people must travel from intersection to intersection if they wish to move between three or more shadows.
Each species has its own culture and civilization, but trade and travel have tended to promote similarities between all civilizations. Most of them are friendly with all the others, but there are a few that do not get on well with certain others. I have no idea of the reasons though. People told us there had been wars in the past, and that some areas were dangerous even now, but most people seemed to think that wars were slowly becoming a thing of the past.
Magic (not sorcery, I'll get to that later) is well known, and well practiced. It does have a large amount of nonsense attached, as people build up recipes of what seems to work without ever understanding why. Most of what we saw seemed to be restricted to simple illusions, and the aid of allies - elemental creatures that can influence the material world. They could start fires, transport messages long distance, move objects around, cause storms and so on.
People wishing to learn magic must find a teacher, and then contact spirits, building up legions of allies upon which they could call for aid. The teacher's own allies would serve to locate and introduce others. None of us know what the allies receive in return for their help, and none of us are motivated to study magic to find out. People answered most of our questions freely, but were more guarded about the exact details of their magic. It could also be that most of them simply do not understand why things work. We might have to observe the interactions ourselves, and see what we can divine. Enyil suggested that there might be some emotional relationship between people and allies.
In our limited exposure to these shadows, it seemed that each person who practiced magic had to work out a library of diagrams and gestures with which they would make their desires known to their allies. For example, someone might draw a square, divide it into four rows of four squares each, and write a glyph into a number of the small squares. This might mean 'light the fire'. The magician would carry a collection of these with him or her, take out the one they wanted to use, expose it briefly to the air, and then what they wanted would happen. Others would make particular gestures with their hands to achieve the same results. Gestures were thought to be superior to diagrams.
They attach great significance to each of the glyphs, and their arrangements into various diagrams. Whole treatises had been written on particular spells, and whether one arrangement of glyphs worked better than others. No one seemed to understand that in reality all that was happening was the trained elementals recognized that a particular diagram meant they were supposed to perform a particular action.
Due to the reliance on magic, their technology is largely restricted to what could be done by muscle power and simple machines. That suggests to me that there should be a class of slaves hidden away somewhere, but we saw no evidence of slaves. It may be that their allies serve that function, or there may be caste/class distinctions with certain castes providing the raw muscle power.
However, travelers from other shadows, -the outside- as they term it, keep adding in bits of technology. The civilizations we visited had a sort of renaissance feel to them - people were open to new ideas, everyone we encountered seemed to have some form of education, and ideas were flowering. I am sure the multiple cultures had much to do with that. The people we met simply accepted that some of us looked different from them, while some were curious about our own backgrounds.
The term sorcerer is reserved for those like us who could cross outside the thirty one aethyrs, and shift between any shadows, speak mind to mind as the Viharani do, or perform other acts from their own powers, without the need for allies. Sorcerers are accorded a great deal of respect, and I believe that many hope one day to become sorcerers themselves. The practice of magic however, acts to inhibit the development of their own powers, because instead of exercising and developing your own powers, you become diverted into the search for compliant allies, leaving your own powers stunted and dormant. Well, most people back home have that problem too.
The first aethyr we visited, the one with the garden restaurant, has a mild Mediterranean climate, and is populated mainly by humans. We did not take a native tour guide, so we do not know how they designated the different aethyrs, but we do know that it wasn't by linear proximity as we traveled. We simply looked for the closest we had not visited, and then shifted there.
The next was cooler and drier, with soaring snow-capped mountain peaks and dark pine forests. The native sentient species here was humanoid, but with blue gray skins, bald heads with a crest of colored bone, and retractable claws on their hands. Despite their rather fearsome appearance, they were friendly toward us.
The next was tropical, with greenish skies, small landmasses and lush vegetation. There were many of the Byroni here, but this was not their home shadow. The native sentient race was amphibious, and looked something like an ape crossed with a crocodile. They stood about five feet or one and a half meters high on their hind legs, had tough leathery hide like a crocodile, and came complete with tail about three meters long. Instead of a jaw filled with teeth, there was an elongated beak. We found them polite, but other people had commented that they weren't very friendly towards humans, preferring the company of the Byroni.
Another shadow had pale yellow skies, was excessively hot and humid with lush vegetation. There were many highly perfumed flowers with bright colored petals. One in particular was over a meter in diameter, with huge fleshy blood colored petals and central pollen stalk that towered three or four meters high and was covered with yellow and orange powder. This shadow was the home of the Byroni, along with a number large insect like creatures including dragon flies with two meter wingspans and a squat jeweled creature about the size of a tank that preyed on everything else and spun webs like spiders.
Another one had pale pink skies and sheer cliffs and crags. Even the yellow vegetation had thorns like cacti. This one was the home of the angel like creatures we had spied the day before.
Another one was cold enough for permanent snow cover, and consisted of a number of low mountains; the native species resembled polar bears crossed with gorillas. There was a ski run near where we arrived, we could see the lifts and skiers in the distance.
Another shadow was stranger than I expected, almost all the vegetation was crystalline cacti of one hue or another. The ground was littered with shards that made walking treacherous, and threatened to cut unprotected feet. Brightly colored fungi grew on the fallen shards, orange ear shapes, yellow and red toad stools, luminous blue penis shapes, dark green trumpet shapes and many more. The sky was silver mother of pearl. The sentient species here was an intelligent land snail with a conical shell one and a half meters high. They possessed eyestalks and four tentacles that could be used like hands and fingers.
Another shadow had really pale blue skies and deep rust red soil. The landscape seemed fairly flat, with only low rolling hills. The vegetation was bushes and shrubs with dark green fleshy leaves, and tall straggling trees with thin bluish needle like leaves that grew in clumps on the bone white branches. We had arrived near a town, though at first sight it did not look like a town. The buildings were hollowed out from the ground, and all that could be seen on the surface were signs that indicated the building entrances. Some more imposing buildings also had hollowed out boulders to serve as their entrances. The sentient race from this shadow looked semi human, but their skins were a deep purple color. Some parts of their bodies like their heads and backs were encrusted with brightly colored scales that formed intricate patterns. They added to the effect by wearing harnesses encrusted with gems. Their eyes were compound eyes like those of an insect, and their teeth were sharp and pointed.
Yet another shadow was dry and warm. The area we arrived in was hard baked yellow sand, weathered mountains, hills and the like. Reddish spiny cacti grew here and there, along with a barrel shaped tree that was wider than it was high. A nest of branches grew from the top almost like a crown, and the red foliage was dotted with green flowers. Nearby was a small town nestled into a cliff, though some of the dwellings sprawled across the floor of the canyon. The people resembled frill necked lizards two meters high, though they walked upon their hind legs all the time.
I know we missed a lot, there just wasn't time to cover everything. One item we know we missed was a mile high waterfall, where the ocean of one shadow intersected and poured into the sky of another. In another there were supposed to be beautiful crystal caves, we were given directions, but it would have taken several hours to reach them.
There are more humanoids than non-humanoids in the thirty one aethyrs, but that does not mean the humanoids form an alliance against the non humans. The towns are usually mixtures of many of the sentient races. Nalini and I decided we would return, and take advantage of some of the holiday packages available to tourists.
We were all to meet that evening at the same restaurant we'd eaten the night before. Durathror, Ra'anor, Liz and Rupert were already there.
&quot;Hey guys!&quot; Liz called out &quot;I could actually see different shadows, and shift between them! And so did Rupert!&quot;
&quot;Congratulations!&quot; Well, it would have been easy here, but at least now they would have some understanding of what we did. &quot;We'll make shadowshifters of you yet!&quot;
&quot;I know it's easy here, but I'm motivated to learn more now!&quot;
&quot;How about you Rupert?&quot;
&quot;Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that such things existed. When you brought us from England to Aquilonia, I know you explained about parallel earths, but I never really appreciated what you were talking about. I only believed you because the scenery changed. As far as I knew, you were using magic and had tame demons to do your work for you. I have now seen these parallel earths with my own eyes, and I have moved between them. I know now it is a natural power that can be developed. I am not sure whether I should develop these powers, but I think I would like to.&quot;
Durathror remarked &quot;There are dangers in learning anything, and there are dangers in walking through shadows, but there are also dangers in living. We make it a rule never to travel by yourself until you are fully trained, always travel with someone who is fully trained.&quot;
&quot;What do you mean you're not sure if you should?&quot; I asked.
&quot;This idea is completely outside my expectations. People from my own erà culture will think I am a witch or magician. You yourselves sometimes use the term sorcery to refer to the ability. All this worries me. But I believe I know you well enough to trust you. I have always wanted to travel to strange lands, to explore places. I have thought of traveling to the New World, and India, and perhaps Africa as well. If I can learn this, then I can travel places I have never been. I will also be able to do that while I am learning. This is a wondrous opportunity. It also means I will be able to spend time with the lady Elizabeth even after we all return home.&quot;
We all smiled at that, even Liz, though she looked slightly embarrassed.. Ra'anor observed &quot;You have some exercises to practice, and you still have to try to find us in your dreams. But you will be able to perform some training with Liz.&quot;
&quot;Rupert, we'll drop in to visit you from time to time after you go home. You will see us again. And one day you will be able to visit us.&quot;
Amrik clapped him on the back. &quot;I never thought I would learn, but here I am, starting to learn. I have no intention of being chained to the throne for the rest of my live, and this will give me the chance to travel without being recognized. And who knows, we might even do some good, hey?&quot;
Rupert nodded, and replied seriously. &quot;Your intervention will stop our civil war, will lead to our king being restored to the throne, and the end of the witch inquisition. You will have done much good in the England where I live. That is another reason for learning: perhaps I can do some good.&quot;
Imladril arrived soon after, with all seven puritans following. &quot;Iskandor will be along shortly.&quot; she announced. &quot;Prospero, the lady Elaine insisted on riding, she claimed she was dressed for dinner, so she would not walk.&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;She has a very strong personality.&quot;
Mark the puritan, a tall thin minor noble in his mid thirties, sniffed. &quot;It is not seemly for the king to go gallivanting around with some high bred whore.&quot; He probably intended it to be a whispered comment to his cronies, but with a translation spell operating, his comments were broadcast to the rest of the table.
Prospero stood up, his gaze icy. &quot;The lady in question is my mother. You will withdraw that remark, or you will die.&quot;
&quot;Ulp! How in heaven's name did you hear that?&quot; He stood, fear in his eyes.
Imladril cut in &quot;You should learn to control your sinful thoughts Mark.&quot;
Cromwell interrupted, his words smooth, his voice raspy as ever. &quot;We unreservedly withdraw that remark. The lady Elaine is a fine woman of noble character. Mark!&quot;
Mark was white. &quot;Ià Ià withdraw my remarks&quot; he stammered. &quot;Ià spoke without thoughtà. I did not knowà the lady was your mother.&quot;
There was a derisive smile playing around Prospero's lips, and I knew he despised the groveling Mark. &quot;Very well, I will accept your apology. But first, I would know why you should think that a lady accompanying your king should be a whore.&quot;
&quot;Ià Ià It's just à&quot;
&quot;Sit down Mark!&quot; Cromwell spat out. &quot;And be quiet before you make matters worse!&quot; He turned his gaze to Prospero. His eyes were steady. &quot;Duke Prospero, the king is a married man, as are most of us here. We think it unseemly that a married man should be seen in the company of a woman who is not his wife unless her husband is also there. Mark has overstepped all bounds of common decency with his remarks. I will deal with him later.&quot;
Prospero replied coldly &quot;The lady Elaine is my mother, she was widowed seven years ago. She is probably the highest-ranking noblewoman in the kingdom, who better to partner a visiting king? I think all of you should think very hard about why you believe a well bred noble woman would ever behave improperly.&quot;
Cromwell opened his mouth to say something, but Amrik cut him off. &quot;Prospero, sit down. Mark has apologized, he can't help it if he is congenitally stupid.&quot; Prospero grinned and sat. The king continued &quot;Cromwell, it seems to me that you puritans are plagued by lustful thoughts. You do not spend enough time with women, you regard them merely as receptacles of your lust. As a consequence, if you see a man with a woman, you immediately jump to the conclusion that sex is the only thing they have on their minds. Has it occurred to you that you are guilty of judging others by your own thoughts? You need to learn that they are people just like men, though they think a little differently. There is no reason why a man should not have as many female friends as male friends. Only the base born think that all they have in common with women is sex.&quot;
&quot;Yeah Cromwell, girls are people too, not sex objects!&quot; Liz interjected.
Cromwell pursed his lip, but nodded. &quot;We have tried to purge all sinful thoughts from ourselves, and devote ourselves as our heavenly father directs, but it seems that the more we try to avoid sinful thoughts, the more they plague us. You are quite right that women should not be treated as objects, but equals in the sight of god. We teach this, but many of us still have trouble putting it into practice.&quot;
Imladril interrupted &quot;Maybe we should bring your wives here. Your problems stem from trying to fight or ignore these thoughts; you only make them stronger. But you also give them strength because you avoid women, you do not know how to be friends with them. And instead of struggling with your sinful thoughts, accept that they have happened, and move onto something else. Do not give them strength. Perhaps you need some more lessons?&quot;
&quot;Your majesty, if it please you, we have had enough lessons for one day, we must still digest them.&quot;
&quot;So what happened to you guys today?&quot; Paula asked.
&quot;We have been sight seeing, and learning lessons.&quot; Imladril replied. &quot;Lord Cromwell, will you tell the others about your day?&quot;
He looked a little non-plussed. &quot;It has been quite an eventful day. I have seen with my own eyes these parallel earths of which you speak, and I have been able to walk into one or the other as I choose. I now know that with training I can do what you others do. Some among us are terrified at the prospect. We all know now it is not magic or demon helpers, but a skill that we all can learn. I can never look at god's creation in quite the same light, for now I know that all around us here are other earths, and that there are those who can travel at will between them. The safest room, the securest dungeon is no longer secure. I am not afraid though, I believe that god has shown me these things either to teach us something, or to open opportunities to us.&quot;
&quot;Very few people have learned the skills to travel between shadows.&quot; Imladril interrupted. &quot;You are in little danger from strangers, and no danger from us.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;I just hope you bear us no ill will for bringing you here in the first place.&quot;
&quot;I bear none of you any ill will.&quot; Cromwell spoke slowly. &quot;I am not happy that I have been kidnapped, but I have decided that god has a purpose in this. I would like to think that we can teach you, but I fear that you are teaching us.&quot; He sighed, took a swallow of water. There was a wary look in his eyes that made me think he was telling us what he thought we wanted to hear. Well, we would just have to hold him to his statements.
He continued &quot;This morning we visited one of your churches. There were those among us who called it a Temple of Mammon, and accused you all of being heathens or foul demon worshippers. But I took the trouble to listen to the priest with an open mind; many of the things he said were in accord with Jesus' teachings. There are also differences, far worse than Catholics I might add. But I have kept Duke Prospero and Earl Danny's words in mind, namely that Jesus came to our earth and taught things appropriate to the culture he found there; but to worlds with different backgrounds he came under different names and taught what was appropriate to the cultures there. This is a discomforting thought, but in god all things are possible. I would prefer to believe that Jesus is Jesus in all cultures, but your history includes no Hebrews. Either you need us as missionaries to bring you the word of god, or you have your own. This whole topic discomforts me, we have much soul searching to performà&quot;
&quot;Lord Cromwell,&quot; I interjected &quot;It could also be that god intends you to learn things from other cultures, and so realize that the message Jesus delivered was spiritual milk to spiritual babes, and couched in a language appropriate to the culture and the times. You received the truth, but not the whole truth, simply that portion of the truth was given to the Hebrews and Greeks of that age. He has come to other earths under different names, and taught them what is appropriate to them. I believe that you could lean things from Aquilonia, and you could teach them things. If you would be a missionary, you must also realize that you do not have all the truth, but only a portion that Jesus gave you.&quot;
He managed to smile weakly. &quot;It is that idea that is the most discomforting. But the apostle Paul does write of giving spiritual milk to spiritual babes. It is galling to think that we are still considered babes.&quot; The he looked more stern. &quot;Young man, if I had not seen with my own eyes that these parallel earths exist, I would not countenance this idea for a moment! You have Jesus in your history, as we have him in ours. Yours could be an imposter, or yours and ours are the same son of god. If we accept this latter, then it is possible he also came to Aquilonia. Aquilonia has no Hebrews, if Jesus came, then he would phrase his message differently.
&quot;But I must also consider our recent actions, where we lacked compassion, and cannot claim to have acted as true Christians. The fact that we have been led astray makes me doubly wary of your words and ideas, but at the same time, I must check them against my bible. To my chagrin I find that where I check, your words are right, and mine own are wrong. I cannot trust mine own initial reactions to your words and ideas, I must investigate them first. And so, even though I have today encountered much that discomforts me, I have not rejected anything out of hand. I will condemn nothing, except where it is clearly proscribed in my bible. However, I may still condemn what I see, after due consideration.&quot;
&quot;Congratulation Lord Cromwell, it takes a man to admit to being wrong. We all make mistakes, if we do not learn from them, we are doomed to repeat them.&quot; I replied. &quot;What sort of things have you encountered which you disapproved of?&quot;
&quot;I would say that the religion of Mithras is pagan, and a blasphemous parody of Christianity, but if I accept that Jesus might have been born in your world as Mithras, then there is little that the priest told me that contradicts my bible. Mithras was the sacrificial bull, Jesus was the sacrificial lamb. You partake of wine, which represents the blood of Mithras, and the covenant between your people and your god, we partake of wine and bread, representing the blood and body of Jesus, and the new covenant. Mithras fights against the evil one; Mithras taught many things that echo the words of Jesus. Last week I would have said that to claim that both are the same son of the living god was blasphemy, today I must admit that it may have pleased god to send his son to your people. But tell me Earl Danny, how is it you know so much of our scriptures?&quot;
I smiled. &quot;It's really quite simple. Prospero, Amrik and the others are from Aquilonia, but Nalini, Paula, Liz and myself are from an earth like yours, and we are Christian. We three are anglican, Liz is catholic. Our world had an English civil war, but it was never as severe as in yours. If that causes you trouble, consider, in our world, the English civil war was over three hundred years ago, and Jesus was born two thousand years ago. As far as I am concerned, the same Jesus was born in your world and in ours, except that he was born earlier in ours. So we have no trouble with the concept that he also came to Aquilonia as Mithras fifteen hundred years ago.&quot;
Cromwell shook his head. His friend Matthew was nodding, as if our conversation made sense to him, and echoed things he had turned over in his mind. &quot;I too find it disagreeable to consider that Jesus could have been born anywhere else. But I have convinced myself that if god saw fit to create parallel earths, and arrange similar histories on some of them, then he could also arrange for Jesus to be born in each one. But if Jesus could be born in other worlds, what of the rest of us? In your English civil war, was there a king Charles?&quot; We nodded. &quot;Was there also an Oliver Cromwell, and a Matthew Carfax?&quot; I nodded again. Liz had said that she thought some of the names were different, that the Earl of Essex had a different surname, but I wasn't about to split hairs. &quot;Would they be the same people?&quot;
Cromwell added &quot;I would also like to know what happened in that war. Would you say that your Oliver Cromwell was the same as me?&quot;
I gave them an honest answer. &quot;Probably not. The soul of that Oliver Cromwell has gone on from there. I know that if we accept that Jesus was born in several earths, then it could be possible for each of us to be born again also. But why? For Jesus there is good reason. For us, would god arrange matters so that events happen again, and give us another chance to get it right? It is a tempting thought, but I would prefer to believe that we are not them.&quot;
Matthew commented &quot;There is no biblical basis for being born in another body, or have we missed something?&quot;
&quot;As far as I know, Jesus never made any pronouncement to the effect that these events will happen to you when you die. He always spoke in parables, and of course parables can be misinterpreted.&quot; I wasn't going to make any pronouncements about reincarnation to these puritans. &quot;No where in the bible does Jesus ever firmly shut the door on being reborn, nor does he open it. But there are some passages you can consider. In the old testament, god makes two pronouncements: the first is that the soul that sins will be punished, and none other; the second is that punishment for the sinner will be visited unto the seventh generation. If you take the usual interpretation that the second means the children and grandchildren, then the second conflicts with the former. If you believe that being reborn is possible, then the second would mean that your punishment will follow you for seven rebirths. I merely suggest that as something to be investigated. Another one that comes to mind is where they ask Jesus about a man born blind, and ask if it is because of his parents' sins, which is the usual interpretation, or because of his own sins. Now the only way he could be punished for his own sins by being born blind would be to have sinned prior to his birth, that is, in a previous life. Jesus does not rule out either possibility.&quot;
Matthew quoted &quot;'In his case, neither, but that the works of god may be made manifest.' You are right, it proves nothing. He leaves the door ajar, neither closing it nor opening it. That must have been intentional, perhaps to do with spiritual milk?&quot;
I quoted back &quot;'There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.' We do the best we can with the information we have available to us. We try to promote peace and harmony instead of war and suffering.&quot;
&quot;We have much to think about.&quot; Cromwell sighed. &quot;But you still haven't answered what happened in your civil war.&quot;
&quot;Ah, I daresay Liz can tell you more than I can, but Cromwell eventually captured the king, and had him beheaded. Cromwell himself died a year or so later, probably of poison. His son briefly succeeded him as lord protector, but by then the people grew tired of the puritan ways, and clamored for Charles the younger to ascend to the throne. I am not sure, but I believe that Cromwell's wife and children were thrown into the streets and died penniless, and his son may have been executed for treason or insurrection.&quot; Cromwell looked downcast. &quot;Lord Cromwell, we would spare you that if we can.&quot;
Liz chose not to correct me &quot;From what I've seen of your England, it isn't the same anyway. My impression is that it's been a lot worse than ours, so the future might be much worse as well.&quot;
Cromwell nodded, looking into the distance. &quot;Young man, had you come to me a week ago with these tales, I would have thought you an arrogant blasphemer, or perhaps mad. Now I must consider that you might be right. We have much to think about. We have tried to do what is best for England, but with hindsight we should have done differently. We have not promoted peace and harmony.&quot;
At this point king Charles, the duchess Elaine on his arm, and prince consort Iskandor arrived. Charles nodded to all of us, except Amrik, whom he embraced, and Enyil, from whom he accepted a kiss on the cheek. Lady Elaine bowed to king Amrik, nodded to the rest of us, then finally hugged and kissed her son. By this time, Amrik had stood and rounded the table. He picked Elaine up in a bear hug exclaiming &quot;Mother!&quot; and swung around before setting her down beside king Charles again.
&quot;Lah your majesty, I am not your mother, though I would certainly be proud to have you as my son.&quot; She was grinning widely.
Amrik explained at a slightly lower tone &quot;I lost my entire family years ago. Duke Leto and yourself have been my father and mother since then. Now please be seated, I am hungry!&quot;
Amrik had reserved two seats beside him for Charles and Elaine; he seated Elaine beside himself and the king next to Elaine. This meant that Nalini sat beside king Charles. Iskandor sat beside Enyil. Amrik ordered a different banquet from the night before, but added &quot;I would like a nice roast leg of venison or something similar, some good crusty bread, and a jug of good brown ale if you have some.&quot;
&quot;I am sure we can sir. We have ninety eight varieties of beer, twenty seven of them would qualify as brown ale. I shall bring several jugs sir.&quot;
Prospero leaned over &quot;Bring several different types if you will. And some lager for Rupert here.&quot;
As the waiter walked away, Amrik explained to Charles &quot;Let the others enjoy their gourmet delicacies, I am a roast meat man.&quot;
One waiter brought jugs of ale, a second brought bottles of wine, while a female waiter brought jugs of water and deposited them near the puritans. Cromwell exclaimed &quot;Ah, good. We do not drink wine or ale, only water.&quot;
Amrik shook his head. &quot;You deny yourselves the simple pleasures of life.&quot;
Cromwell smiled back &quot;Your majesty, some would say you deny yourself the pleasures of life by ordering roast meat instead of gourmet delicacies.&quot;
Matthew added piously &quot;We wish to avoid temptation to sin, and wine befuddles the senses.&quot;
&quot;Ah Matthew, Cromwell. 'Take a little wine for thy stomach's sake' as St. Paul said to St. Timothy. Even Jesus turned water into wine, and drank wine. Anything to excess is bad for you, but a little wine is good.&quot;
Matthew shook his head. &quot;Did Jesus really drink wine?&quot;
&quot;Yes, there is a passage in one of the gospels, I'm not sure which one right now, where he says something like &quot;John comes drinking water, and eating locusts and wild honey, and they say he is a holy man. I come drinking wine and eating with sinners and they condemn me as a drunkard and a sinner&quot; or something like that.&quot;
&quot;Hey! Enough!&quot; Amrik growled. &quot;Let's eat tonight without getting into fights over religious interpretation of scripture.&quot;
We all agreed, though Matthew added &quot;We will look for that passage tonight.&quot;
Much of the evening's discussion centered around what everyone had done that day. King Charles and Lady Elaine had accompanied Iskandor, Imladril and the Puritans on a journey through shadow. All had observed marvels, all had seen things they had never imagined. Neither Charles nor Elaine had much interest in learning the process of shadow shifting, but they had enjoyed their walk, and expressed interest in other guided tours.
I think all the military minds at the table were well aware of the implications of shadow shifting on a battle where troops might sneak by completely unseen, to emerge behind enemy lines and launch an attack from an unexpected quarter. Hints were dropped, but little concrete was said.
The puritans had received a few shocks as well, which explained why they were subdued this evening. Thomas had made some nasty remarks to Imladril, and for his pains she had transformed him into a pig, saying &quot;You behave like a pig. I ask god to transform you into one right now.&quot;
Fear does wonders to clarify the mind, and crystallize perceptions. The other puritans had stopped short of calling Imladril a witch, fearful that they might suffer the same fate. Imladril had patiently explained the difference between magic and what she had done, maintaining that her power came from god. It was probably touch and go, but I believe Imladril had used some of her powers to influence the puritans into acceptance of her statements. She transformed Thomas back after perhaps half an hour.
Thomas as pig had been acutely aware of everything going on around him, and of his vanished humanity. Imladril had made some pointed remarks about roast pig for lunch, and raised the issue of whether eating the pig was cannibalism since it had once been Thomas. It was only when the Puritans reached a consensus that they would not eat Thomas because they felt it was cannibalism that Imladril explained that she and Iskandor were vegetarian, and felt the same about killing anything for food. Needless to say, Thomas was mightily relieved when he was transformed back.
Imladril had forced them to confront other ethical dilemmas as well, causing all the puritans to re-evaluate their attitudes. She had challenged them to prove any statement she disagreed with, and often had gone on to demonstrate the absurdity of their position. The result was that tonight they were no longer quite so self righteous. They had not lost their religious fervor, but now realized that their zeal had been misplaced or misguided.
King Charles proved quite sociable, even agreeing to dispense with titles away from the kingdom. He could talk at length on many subjects, and had a knack of seeming interested in what ever the topic of conversation was.
The puritans, off the topic of religion, proved friendly; some were even talkative. I think they had realized that we were the hand that fed them, and the wisdom of not biting that hand had slowly sunk in. Simon, the other merchant puritan, had even expressed some interest in learning more about shadow shifting. The others tried to quieten him, but he persisted &quot;If it is sanctioned by god, then I see no reason why not! There is nothing in the bible about it.&quot;
&quot;Hmph!&quot; Matthew snorted. &quot;If god meant for man to travel to these parallel earths, we would be able to do so from birth! God has not vouchsafed us to know of it, so it should be forbidden!&quot;
&quot;And if god had meant us to ride in carriages, he would have given us wheels?&quot; I asked. Well, some of them laughed.
Durathror commented &quot;It's a case of milk for babies and solid food for adults. My own people all know how to do this, but yours can learn.&quot;
Imladril added pointedly &quot;If you would forbid it, then how will you get home?&quot;
Cromwell shook his head. &quot;I do not condemn those of you who know how, but I do not think that my people should learn. It would be impossible to hold prisoners, no one would be safe inside the walls of their houses. God has reason for not teaching us about it, I do not intend to allow anyone to learn!&quot;
Charles commented &quot;Meseems that it could be a danger to rulers, it would make the assassin's task that much easier, and would aid any criminal activity. But should we talk about this back in England, no one would believe us, nor is there anyone there to teach us. I think it best we do nothing, and say nothing.&quot;
Imladril replied &quot;Most people have no idea that other earths exist. Normally we do not even tell people that we have this ability. We very rarely teach anyone. I am not entirely happy that you people know that we have this ability. But that cannot be undone. If any of you wish to learn, you must prove yourselves worthy. I issue you all with a challenge. You know what we look like.&quot; She indicated her brother Durathror, her consort Iskandor, and Durathror's consort Ra'anor. &quot;Find us in your dreams. The first steps of learning take place there. God has allowed you to know of our abilities, if he lets you find any of us in your dreams, we will teach you, but not otherwise.&quot;
Cromwell looked grim for a moment, but nodded. &quot;You will not teach any of us, nor publicize your abilities back in England? Then I believe I have my wish. If god has reason for any of us to learn, he will indicate that in our dreams.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I thought my life was difficult before you people appeared in it!&quot;
Durathror laughed. &quot;Cheer up, when we return you all to England, we hope things will be more peaceful, and less difficult.&quot;
The other discussion we all became involved with was about choosing people for parliament, and how to form a government. Everyone agreed that the king should be the head of government, with the position passing by birth. The king should be active, not a figurehead, with powers more like an American President. Charles was not entirely happy with his powers being curbed, but the puritan faction did agree, along with the rest of us. After some discussion, Charles languidly waved a hand and acquiesced.
The House of Lords consisted of one member for each noble house, usually the head of the house, or his nominated representative. The idea of political parties was unknown to them, but they did know of factions. Everyone seemed reasonably happy with the idea that the faction commanding the majority of seats would control which laws were passed. The idea that parliament should sit for several weeks each month, and for most months of the year, was novel to the English. Past kings had summoned parliament only when they wished to raise taxes, and dissolved parliament again when the tax was raised. King Charles had tried to govern for eleven years without ever convening parliament. However, once they realized that the parliament could propose laws of its own, but which still needed the king's approval, the puritans supported the idea, and Charles grudgingly came round when Amrik came out strongly in support.
The main problem was the House of Commons. In this shadow England, only high-ranking officials, rich merchants and the like could be chosen. Nalini, myself, Paula and Liz favored the approach we were familiar with, where seats were declared, and anyone could put themselves up for election by all qualified voters in the electorate. We wanted to enfranchise all citizens over the age of eighteen, except for criminals and the insane. That idea did not gain a lot of support.
Amrik, Prospero and the others claimed that this was not technically feasible, arguing that trying to coordinate voting across the country and trying to make electorates roughly the same size was too difficult. They favored the idea of local councils elected by adult men and women. The councils would have higher levels over them, several levels in fact. Each level would choose a representative for the higher level. The highest level would be the House of Commons itself.
The puritans supported the basics of the hierarchical councils, though they used terms like boroughs, parishes, shires and counties. None of them were particularly concerned with the number of electors in each electorate, but none of them wanted to give women the vote. Cromwell wanted the voters restricted to godly men, leaders of church congregations, while Matthew and the other puritans were prepared to allow the male head of each household to vote. None of the puritans wanted Catholics or Jews to be able to vote.
We argued long about who should be enfranchized. Charles supported the rest of us in allowing Catholics and Jews the vote; Cromwell backed down in the face of determined opposition, although I believed he would try again once he was home.
none of the English, including the king, were prepared to budge on giving women the vote. Their premise was that women were weak, hysterical, and too soft to make decisions of this importance.
&quot;What about Queen Elizabeth?&quot; Liz demanded. &quot;Was she weak and hysterical?&quot;
King Charles observed &quot;There are some who would say she was too emotional for good government. She never married and produced heirs, she failed her duty there.&quot;
&quot;And you would not be king if she had!&quot; Nalini spat back. &quot;I believe there would be fewer wars if women ran the country, we are more mature, we don't play games out of macho pride, we know how to manage finances better than most men.&quot;
I added &quot;If you check your scripture, you will find that women played an equal part in the congregation.&quot;
&quot;The shepherds were always men!&quot; Matthew countered. &quot;All the important decisions were taken by men, not women.&quot;
Even Charles weighed in &quot;A queen may rule in her own right only when there are no close male relatives to be made king. The bloodline is important. If the head of a noble house dies, and has no close male relatives, then his wife may become the head of the house. But there must be a male to step into the role, or the house dies. For once Cromwell and I are in agreement, women should not have the vote!&quot;
The lady Elaine commented &quot;My son Prospero is now the head of our house, and bears the title duke. But should he die without issue, I become head of the house, I will choose who will be the next duke. There would be only one person in the kingdom who could naysay my choice, and that is his majesty king Amrik. I believe that women know just as much about politics as men do, and they should be allowed to vote. We are not second class citizens. It is true that some women concern themselves only with gossip, making clothes and babies, but there are as many men who concern themselves with drinking, fighting or tilling the soil of their estate. I think you English should reconsider.&quot;
Prospero began to smooth things over. &quot;This is our society, not yours. Here women are the equals of men. In England this is obviously not yet the case. The solution has to be one that works for you, but you should be wary of forbidding women the vote. Your society will change, they will demand it eventually.&quot;
That wasn't the last word, but suffrage for women united the king and the puritans enough for them to agree broadly on the hierarchical modal that Amrik and Prospero had proposed. Nalini and I ended up taking copious notes about how things would work so that Prospero's scribes could write them up. Surprisingly, several issues marked for discussion during the next week had been resolved.

            <Text>Chapter 7
The day of the wedding dawned clear, which the more superstitious saw as an omen for a long and happy marriage. There was a festive feel to the city, there had been for the past few days as banners and bunting were erected, and street performers strutted their stuff. We'd seen jugglers, dancers, mime artists, minstrels and musicians, clowns, assorted more bizarre circus acts, street theatre and more.
Today would be a long day for many. Bakers had been up since midnight baking festive cakes for the day, chefs and cooks had been preparing for the feasts since before dawn. Stall owners were setting up at choice points along the route of the procession, and anywhere that crowds were likely to gather. They were selling everything from souvenir plates, mugs, spoons and small flags and the like to drinks like beer, wines, flavored water and juices to foods like dozens of different sweet buns and donuts, many varieties of savory food including things wrapped in pastry, sausages in buns, noodle dishes, and things on sticks, including char-grilled lizard on a stick.
Workers were putting the finishing touches to stands and barricades along the route, finalizing decorations, arranging flowers, sweeping streets and making sure that everything was spot on.
The logistics of the event was staggering. Those in the know estimated that the population of Tarantia had more than doubled, which would put a considerable strain on its resources. There were several thousand guests who would attend the wedding ceremony and the feasts. Food was needed for two feasts, but in addition crowd control was needed for possibly half a million people, along with food for anyone who did not bring it from home, and accommodation for the ones from out of town.
Some had predicted that food prices would rise during the week before and after the wedding. However, the seneschal lord Amalrik had arranged weeks in advance for additional supplies to be brought in. Several grassed areas in the city had been used to pasture animals that would be used for meat during the festivities. Some warehouses were currently overflowing with foodstuffs to the point that some merchants had complained the glut was driving prices down.
The wedding party would ride in procession through most of the city's main streets on their way from the palace to the temple, and again afterwards on their way to the feast. Nalini and I were one of a fairly large group of nobles who would ride in that procession. We would be part of the main group that would form the bodyguard. Liz and Paula would ride with us as part of our entourage.
The palace guests were also to ride in the procession, so king Charles, as one of nine visiting monarchs, would ride behind the main nobles who formed the bodyguard. In a surprising gesture of solidarity, he had invited the puritans to ride with him as part of his entourage. Cromwell had accepted.
The breakfast room was busier than usual as many guests arose near dawn to ensure they were all ready for the procession. Cromwell, Matthew, Thomas and Stephen were already eating at one table, while Robert, Tobias and James were eating at another. We waved to both tables, but went to sit with Imladril and Iskandor.
They both smiled at us. Imladril commented &quot;Well, once upon a time, you two would ride in our entourage. Now you have your own.&quot;
&quot;It's all a bit new, it hasn't sunk in yet.&quot; Nalini replied. &quot;We'll be going to visit our estate next week, you must come with us.&quot;
&quot;Thank you, we will. We'll be looking forward to it.&quot;
We went to grab some food. Rupert and Liz walked in together. We knew she had spent the night in his room, but neither of us passed comment. &quot;We're you sitting?&quot; Liz asked.
&quot;With Imladril. Grab some food and join us.&quot;
&quot;We will!&quot;
When they did join us, Imladril asked &quot;Sleep well last night?&quot;
&quot;Yes!&quot; Liz suddenly giggled, Rupert looked a little red and flustered.
Imladril replied &quot;We're glad you both had a good night. We approve.&quot;
Rupert's eyebrows rose. Imladril reached out to pat his hand, commenting &quot;Our cultures are different, we see nothing to be embarrassed about. What is important is that both of you enjoyed yourselves. Now Prince Rupert&quot; she changed the topic &quot;I believe that today you will ride as part of the escort for King Charles?&quot;
Rupert swallowed, looked uncomfortable, but mastered himself. &quot;Er... yes, I am his majesty's nephew, I should form part of his escort. With whom else should I ride?&quot;
&quot;Exactly. Are you satisfied with what you will wear, or would you prefer something different, perhaps more ceremonial?&quot;
&quot;I will have my military uniform in England's colors, and my sword. At home I would probably wear a breastplate and helm, but I have been informed that breastplates and helmets are bad form.&quot;
&quot;All right then. I had in mind that as a prince, you might prefer velvet and lace, and perhaps a crown of sorts?&quot;
Rupert smiled and shook his head. &quot;I am not a king to wear a crown, nor am I comfortable in ribbons and lace. I am a simple military man, I am happier in military style clothes. But thank you.&quot;
Imladril turned to Liz and asked &quot;Liz, are you happy with what you will wear? You will be riding as part of Danny's and Nalini's entourage, you should probably have a necklace and tiara to wear. Or will you dress like Nalini in a military uniform and wear a sword?&quot;
Liz laughed, shaking her head. &quot;I wouldn't know how to use one! I won't be wearing a dress though, I'm riding a horse. Is jewelry okay?&quot;
Imladril nodded &quot;I can loan you some jewelry and a tiara.&quot;
Iskandor remarked &quot;Durathror and I went collecting yesterday. We even found the crown of England for king Charles. The puritans do not know that yet though, but Charles is very happy about that.&quot;
&quot;They are held under lock and key in the tower of London. How did youà&quot; Rupert's voice trailed off as he realized. He nodded &quot;You walked in from another earth, bypassing all the guards, didn't you?&quot;
Iskandor nodded. &quot;Yes, once we knew where we had to go, it was easy. A piece of bread, is that what you people say?&quot; Liz corrected him.
A little later Nalini and I went to visit the puritans for a chat. We were just a little concerned that they might spoil the proceedings. I asked Cromwell what he thought of the planned proceedings, and whether he would be attending the marriage ceremony.
He looked from Nalini to me before replying. His eyes were wary, guarded. &quot;Today we represent England before the people of Aquilonia.&quot; He spoke slowly. &quot;King Amrik has asked us to wear the colors of England instead of our usual garb, and we have agreed. Most of us are military men, we will wear plain military uniforms. We will ride as part of the entourage of king Charles. He is our king, it is fitting that we do so. We will attend the ceremony, and we will not pass comment on what we observe. I know that the religion of Mithras is not Christian, I have decided we should wash our hands on trying to convert Aquilonians to the true faith. There are similarities with Christianity, and there are differences. On whether Mithras is also Jesus I make no judgement. I will admit that the possibility exists, and agree that god deals appropriately with different parallel worlds, but determining the truth or otherwise of that assertion is beyond us at present. We will not condemn the Aquilonians as pagans, nor will we condemn their religion as a travesty and a parody of Christianity. Is this what you wished to hear?&quot;
&quot;Coming from you, Lord Cromwell, that is a magnanimous statement...&quot;
&quot;...We were worried that you or some of the others might see reason to disrupt the ceremonies by condemning the worshippers or participants...&quot;
&quot;...We believe that in the past you have been too quick to condemn that which is different...&quot;
He managed a slight smile. &quot;In the past we have been too quick to condemn, that is true. But I do not say that I approve of anything I have seen here, only that we will neither condemn nor pass judgement.&quot;
&quot;Have you considered that god might want you to see the religion of Mithras so that you might learn that there are different paths that lead in the same direction? That he might want you to conclude that you should be more even handed with Catholics?&quot;
&quot;You labor that point somewhat, earl Daniel.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps like my biblical namesake, I have a vision of what is right, and I am horrified by some of the evil slanders and practices you puritans are responsible for.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Many of the fears you have about Catholics are really to do with the fear that they might show allegiance to Spain. That may have been true in Queen Mary's day, and possibly the early stages of Queen Elizabeth's reign but it certainly is not true today.&quot;
&quot;And many of the spiritual points will not be won by condemning them. You lose the argument if you must resort to condemnation or shouting. And besides, has it crossed your mind that you might also be wrong on some of them?&quot;
&quot;The political and spiritual points are all important.&quot; A look of amusement flashed across his face. &quot;Has it crossed your mind that I might be right, and you might be wrong? No, I see it has not. You can be quite infuriating.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Since meeting you, it has crossed my mind that I might be wrong. It has also crossed my mind that we need to educate them that they might learn the errors of their ways.&quot;
&quot;We don't mean to be infuriating.&quot; I replied. &quot;It's an evolving process; where we come from, it took hundreds of years for religious thought to develop from the stage where you are to the stage where we are. Of course it must be hard for you, many of the concepts are foreign to your culture at present. One that I think is important for you to consider is whether you are losing sight of Jesus' message by concentrating on the form of its expression. Love your enemy, love your neighbor as yourself, do good to those who hate you, forgive others. These are important points, not whether Jesus is really present in the wafer at Eucharist. Who cares? Do you practice what Jesus taught, or do you merely follow the empty forms that have grown up after his death?&quot;
The look of amusement was back. &quot;Some would say that Catholics are the ones who follow the empty forms. The doctrine of transubstantiation is wrong. It leads to many errors of doctrine and dogma, all of which are important...&quot; He trailed off, staring into space. We waited for him to continue. Finally he roused himself and said &quot;I think I see what you are driving at. The Catholic claim of transubstantiation causes them to claim magic from the host, this is wrong. We heatedly argue that the host is not the real presence, they heatedly argue it is. You argue that it does not matter, as long as they try to practice what Jesus taught.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I do not agree with you, but I think I finally understand your point enough to agree that you have a valid point. Scripture and the teachings of the Savior must be the most important considerations. Questions like the doctrine of transubstantiation are secondary issues, we must not let them distract us from following what Jesus taught us. You believe we are allowing them to distract us.&quot;
&quot;We argue that you should not do more that simply agree to disagree on matters of religion. You should treat them the same as any others. Religious tolerance is essential, and that included treating Catholics, Jews and so on as equals in the sight of god, and equal under your laws. To do anything else and you become no better than Pharisees, who were too righteous to associate with sinners. Always, you must ask 'what would Jesus do in this situation?'&quot;
Cromwell sighed. &quot;There you go again, challenging us. When you put it in those words, it seems we should agree with you. Treating Catholics and Jews as equals goes against all our traditions, and our entire upbringing. I very much fear that you have been sent to show me how I can be better Christian.&quot;
&quot;If we can achieve that, then we will be happy. If we can make you a better Christian, then you will teach others. The benefits will flow throughout England and beyond.&quot;
&quot;Perhaps you think too highly of my influence.&quot; He smiled again. &quot;I am considering everything you have said, I am also testing it against my bible. You have caused me to revise my opinions of some of our deeds, I am considering whether some of our attitudes should also be revised. I can promise no more.&quot;
I had to smile. He always had to be the leader. We could suggest, but he would evaluate and decide. It had obviously taken a lot out of him to admit he might have been wrong. &quot;I believe our case will stand up under your scrutiny. The biggest obstacle is whether you can be open enough to give due consideration to our words. Someone who is worthy to be a leader and opinion maker will be open, and consider our words on their merits. I believe you are that sort of man.&quot; I thought of adding more about narrow minds, but didn't.
Cromwell looked at me appraisingly, then nodded. &quot;There are many who are narrow minded, and would reject your words out of hand.&quot; He swept his hand to indicate his friends. &quot;We are politicians, we are open minded enough to consider your words on their merits. Let me also reassure you that we will be gracious today. We are guests of king Amrik, we will not spoil his day for him.&quot;
He left me with the distinct impression he would continue being gracious and agreeable until he returned to England. Once back, he would change his tune. This was where Prospero's guarantees, and our monitoring force would have a role to play.
 Later, we collected in the palace courtyard in preparation for the precession to the temple of Mithras. The courtyard was crowded with nobles, horses, coaches and grooms. Most nobles would ride horses, the coaches were reserved for those too frail to ride. The coaches themselves were magnificent looking things, all polished wood, shiny metals and soft leather. None of them were enclosed, but had folding hoods like convertible cars that could be used during inclement weather. Most of them had two bench seats facing one another, a separate seat for the rider, and a base that curved up at both ends.
The horses were magnificent animals, with shiny coats, gleaming trappings and proud bearing. Many were large cavalry horses, tall and heavy, most of the rest were long legged slender thoroughbreds. There were some notable exceptions.
Nalini, Paula and I were riding our own horses, brought by Imladril or Durathror some days before. There was an extra one for Liz. The horses themselves are large, designed to carry an armored man into battle. Their coats are striped with red and black tiger stripes. They are incredibly swift, and can easily outrun a cheetah, even when carrying a rider. They are quite impressive, but today the Viharani horses upstaged them.
Imladril and her escort were mounted on matched horses scarcely larger than ponies. These sure-footed horses were pure white, except for their manes and tails, which were the color of cloth-of-gold. Each horse had a single white horn that grew from its forehead, the sight of which caused much consternation amongst the Aquilonians.
There were eight Viharani in all, comprised of four couples. I recognized Atlendor, Durathror's grandson, but not the other three. The Viharani were all dressed similarly in tartan kilts and cloaks, white lace fronted shirts, brown riding boots and swords. Their kilts were knee length; I know from past experience wearing a Viharani kilt that it is possible to ride a horse while wearing one. The puritans might be upset to see the women's knees while they were riding though. Imladril wore a crown that at first sight seemed to be cut-crystal, but then I realized by its glitter that it had been shaped from a single diamond. The women also wore jeweled Egyptian styled collars. The men contented themselves with jeweled clasps on their cloaks.
The four of us were dressed similarly in military style clothes with dark blue trousers, black riding boots, sky blue shirts and jackets that consisted of emerald green and black panels. With the gold braid they looked quite effective. Nalini wore her hair long with jeweled combs. Paula and Liz wore tiaras. That may sound odd, but most Aquilonian women wore military style clothes in their house colors, and jewelry.
The puritans were less conspicuous, dressed as they were in black riding boots, dark blue trousers, white shirts and crimson jackets. With swords at their hips, most of them looked like soldiers, with little save the length of their hair to distinguish them from the cavaliers. Both the puritans and the cavaliers were crowded around Imladril's party, inspecting their horses. Liz was there with Prince Rupert; the rest of us were standing with Imladril and Durathror.
Some touched the horses as if to see whether they were real. Rupert asked &quot;Are they truly unicorns like in our legends?&quot;
Durathror laughed. &quot;They are truly unicorns, they may well be the stuff of your legends.&quot;
Cromwell looked at the nearest one appraisingly. &quot;I always thought they were associated with magic and fairies.&quot;
Matthew added &quot;I heard tell that you needed a young virgin to capture one.&quot;
Imladril laughed and shook her head. &quot;That is all superstitious nonsense. These are like most other horses, though their horn makes them more dangerous. We breed them. The fairies of your legend are probably exaggerated tales of us, the Viharani. We have contact with many earths, though there are some we no longer visit because we are not welcome there anymore.&quot;
&quot;Why are you no longer welcome?&quot; Rupert asked.
&quot;Mainly due to Christian slanders.&quot; Imladril explained. &quot;Christianity exists on many earths. Unfortunately there are many where it has taken a form similar to your puritans, and we are condemned as demons. Lord Cromwell, I believe we are the elves of your legends, but most of the stories told about us are completely untrue.&quot;
Rupert was nodding, his eyes wide. Several others were looking at one another in surprise.
Cromwell cleared his throat. &quot;Your majesty, I have been thinking that there is much about your people that reminds me of stories I have heard about elves. What god do you serve?&quot; His voice was suddenly firm, stern.
&quot;We serve the same god you do, the creator of all that exists. Most of us are not Christians, but neither are we pagans nor heathens. Some of us like my brother Durathror do follow the Christian ways, but from another earth where we are accepted.&quot;
Cromwell almost did a double take at this. &quot;You are a Christian, Prince Durathror?&quot;
&quot;I am, but I suspect it is closer to your Greek Orthodox version. There are many earths Lord Cromwell, and there are as many if not more versions of Christianity. That may not please you, but that is how things are.&quot;
&quot;I know that is how things are. It has been my mission to reconcile those diverse faiths, and bring them all back to the truth our savior taught.&quot;
Durathror raised an eyebrow at this pronouncement. &quot; I do not subscribe to the view that my own version is right, and that every other version is wrong. I agree with Danny that it does not matter, because all those versions are probably wrong, including yours and mine. What is important is that we practice what Jesus taught, and show love and compassion to everyone.&quot; Durathror was suddenly steely eyed, staring back at Cromwell. He wagged a finger in Cromwell's face. &quot;Have a care Lord Cromwell. God does not care whether you believe Jesus is really present in the host or not, not does he care about your doctrines and your dogmas! God cares and judges you by your deeds! You know that Jesus preached compassion and forgiveness, if you do not practice that, then he will judge you, and find against you! What a person believes is between them and their god. If it leads them toward the light, then good. If it leads them away from the light, then god will keep trying to guide them back toward the light. There are many paths toward god's light, just as Jesus said 'In my father's house there are many mansions.'&quot; Durathror smiled &quot;However, today is not a day for religious debate. If you wish to debate issues, then I am happy to oblige some other time.&quot;
Cromwell's face had shown a gamut of emotions while Durathror spoke. He was silent for a moment, digesting Durathror's words. Finally he spoke. &quot;Today is for king Amrik, and his bride to be. However, if you are willing, Prince Durathror, we will debate you.&quot; He gestured toward Nalini and me. &quot;You are also welcome earl Daniel, lady Nalini, and anyone else here who is Christian. Earl Daniel has raised many points over the past few days, we have much to discuss. I do seek to know god's truth, I would welcome your opinions.&quot;
A few moments later, the signal was given to mount up. King Charles walked out of a pavilion with several other kings. Behind him walked a page carrying a red cushion bearing a crown, and two burly guards provided by king Amrik. The king had a greeting and a polite word for each of us, and then he mounted his horse. The page handed him the crown, which he placed on his head.
There was shock on several faces, puritan and cavalier alike. Cromwell started &quot;You majesty! Surely that isà&quot;
&quot;This is England's crown. You are correct lord Cromwell. Prince Durathror and prince Iskandor collected it last night. They had our permission, we hope you will not regard this as stealing.&quot;
Cromwell swallowed before he replied &quot;No your majesty, you are entitled to wear England's crown. Would I be correct in assuming that the guards were unaware that you required the crown?&quot; He managed a smile. &quot;No strong-room would be safe should criminals learn their powers.&quot;
Charles smiled regally, enjoying Cromwell's discomfort. &quot;We wrote a note to the effect that the crown was required for a state occasion by England's lawful king, and we signed and sealed it. We still possess the royal seal ring. The princes left that note in place of the crown. We believe this fulfills all legal requirements.&quot;
Amrik and Enyil mounted their horses, then looked around the courtyard. We were all arranged in groups which would start one after the other in clockwise format. &quot;All right! Let's ride!&quot; Amrik bellowed.
Six of the horse guards, dressed in gleaming breastplates, helmets and greaves led the procession. Each carried a tall standard with a colored piece of cloth about the size of a beach towel attached. Each standard was different. Amrik and Enyil rode side by side behind them, the king wearing his simple soldier's clothes, Enyil wearing her tartan. However, she wore trousers, instead of a kilt. Amrik wore a simple gold crown.
Behind them rode another six horse guards bearing standards, then there followed Prospero with his relatives and standard bearer, several other groups of nobles, then Nalini, myself, Paula and Liz, along with a horse guard bearing our standard; behind us rode the visiting kings and their entourages, with king Charles somewhere in the middle. There was even a flagpole with the flag of England, born by a horse guard; it looked a little incongruous because it was arranged to fly vertically from the pole, with metal stiffeners, whereas all the standards were designed to hang vertically from the tops of their poles.
Behind the visiting kings rode the lesser nobles of Aquilonia, which made me wonder what we were doing in front of the visiting kings.
&quot;I think it means that you are somewhere in line for the succession.&quot; Paula suggested. &quot;Everyone else here is one of the great houses, they all have a claim on the throne. I don't know how you managed to wrangle that though.&quot;
&quot;Hey, we saved Amrik's life several times, remember?&quot; I suggested.
Nalini was more thoughtful. &quot;It could be that he trusts us enough to run the kingdom, it could be he wants to use us as a check on the power of the other great houses. Then again, maybe he really is that grateful.&quot;
There were sounds of cheering from outside the palace gates. When we rode out a sea of faces stretching out around greeted us. Simple barricades had been erected to keep people from the road, and there were palace guards stationed along the route to ensure that people stayed on the correct side. I've seen parades before, but I have never been in them. We waved at the crowds from time to time, though none of us were sure whether we were supposed to. Prospero and Amrik did not wave, but seemed to nod to the crowds, though Prospero's mother did perform a good imitation of a royal wave.
Our procession snaked its way down the hill through leafy suburbs toward the town center, and the main temple. We talked as we rode along, though it was sometimes hard to make ourselves heard.
Paula had one burning question. &quot;Hey Liz, did you actually get .laid last night? Tell us about it!&quot;
&quot;Jeez! Don't I have any privacy? How'd you find out?&quot;
Paula sniggered &quot;I could say walls have ears. You made just a little bit of noise there.&quot;
Nalini chuckled &quot;Well Liz, it makes a change from you listening to us! You must have enjoyed yourself then. You don't have to tell us anything if you don't want to, Paula is just a sticky beak.&quot;
&quot;Hey! She found out about me and Danny, so why can't I get to hear about her and Rupert?&quot;
&quot;Seems to me you've already heard all you need!&quot; I commented. &quot;Liz, we may stir you a bit, but we're happy for you. Don't feel embarrassed.&quot;
&quot;Yeah! We all do it Liz&quot; Paula shot back. &quot;Hey, what's he like? Is he big?&quot;
&quot;Paula, can you be a bit more sensitive?&quot; Nalini commented. &quot;Liz, just ignore her.&quot;
&quot;Don't let her put you off tonight either!&quot; I added.
&quot;Huh! I might just not visit him tonight, then you won't hear nuthin', 'cos there'll be nuthin' to hear.&quot;
&quot;You could always take him back to your room. We won't listen.&quot; I responded.
&quot;Hey, I can hear you guys well enough from my room.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, well, you'll be busy with Rupert, so you won't be listening to us, will you?&quot; I countered.
Nalini sniggered &quot;And we'll be preoccupied, we won't be listening to you! Hey, we all do it, so don't feel embarrassed about it.&quot;
Liz sighed &quot;I guess I'll never hear the end of it until I tell you mob. Well, it almost didn't happen, 'cos Rupert didn't think it was the right thing to do. But we went back to his apartment after dinner, and we were both talking and drinking a bit. We just sat and talked for quite a while actually. We weren't sitting that close, 'cos Rupert was being a gentleman, but I managed to wangle it so we were sitting side by side.&quot;
&quot;Hey, we want to hear the juicy bits!&quot; Paula exclaimed.
&quot;Well I ain't gonna tell ya!&quot; Liz shot back.
&quot;Don't say anything Liz&quot; Nalini countered.
&quot;Nah, it's okay, but I'm leaving out the juicy bits. Anyway, at some stage, he kissed my hand, and it just sorta developed from there.&quot;
&quot;Is that all!?&quot; Paula sounded disappointed.
&quot;Well, you guys all do it, I don't have to spell things out. Probably nuthin' different to what you and Prospero get up to.&quot;
&quot;I don't know - Prospero and I get up to some pretty wild things.&quot; Paula smiled suggestively.
&quot;Well, you didn't last night. If you could hear us, then we would have heard you.&quot;
&quot;They were probably too busy listening to the entertainment!&quot; It was my turn to snigger.
&quot;Hey, do you want me to tell you about it or not?&quot; Liz sounded almost indignant.
&quot;I thought you'd finished. You said you were leaving out the juicy bits.&quot;
&quot;Well, I haven't quite finished. He was quite enthusiastic until I got his pants off, then he went all shy. He is well hung Paula, but you ought to know that, 'cos you've seen him in the bath.&quot;
&quot;Liz, did you have any misgivings when you got to that point?&quot; Nalini asked.
&quot;Erà yeah, I was feeling a bit nervous, but I'd already decided to go through with it unless he actually threw me out.&quot;
&quot;Which he didn't&quot; Paula finished.
&quot;No, but he did take some convincing. I had to show him how to use a condom too, he'd never even heard of them before.&quot;
&quot;So how was it?&quot; Nalini asked.
&quot;She enjoyed it, she was squealing!&quot; Paula supplied with a snigger.
&quot;Paula! Let Liz tell it.&quot; I reprimanded.
&quot;Sorry boss!&quot; she almost threw me a mock salute, but remembered in time that it wasn't appropriate here in a public precession. She turned it into a head scratch instead.
Liz continued &quot;Actually, the first time I didn't come. I almost froze when he went in, but I don't think he noticed, he was a bit eager. He came quite quickly, and I told him he was too quick, and he became all apologetic, so I made him promise to do better next time. Then I showed him what to do to make me come, and he did.&quot;
&quot;Fingers, tongue or what?&quot; Paula asked.
&quot;Er... fingers actually.&quot; Liz sounded just slightly embarrassed, but was continuing with the air of someone who is going to see it through. &quot;I hadn't bathed, and I didn't know if he'd be too embarrassed. By the time I came, he was hard again, and this time I didn't freeze up. He lasted longer too, and I came again while he was still working up to his. Is that what you wanted to know?&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;No other problems apart from freezing up the first time? How did you feel while he was inside you? Did you get any flashbacks?&quot;
&quot;I might have if I'd been lying on my back, but I wasn't. The first time I was sitting on him, he was lying down, and the second time I was sitting in the chair and he was kneeling in front of me. But once I came the first time, I relaxed. Besides, he's white; my rapists were all black. Maybe I'll have more problems with a black guy?&quot;
&quot;Maybe, but it's the first time that's hardest. If he's a caring lover, you shouldn't get flashbacks. I take it you didn't have an orgasm while you were being raped?&quot;
&quot;Hell no! Why, did you?&quot;
&quot;I did once.&quot; Nalini spoke slowly. &quot;That caused some problems for a while, but I got over them all with Danny's help. It's a shame you can't find yourself someone as good as him, but Rupert seems sensitive enough, though you might have to teach him a few things.&quot;
Liz was nodding thoughtfully. &quot;I think I understand why you made me that offer about teaching me. Thanks, I appreciate it. But do you think you and Danny can teach me things about sex and energy without actually having to er... do it? You know what I mean.&quot;
I guessed she meant that Nalini thought highly enough of me, and valued the help I'd been in helping her to enjoy sex again that she had wanted to help Liz past that same hump.
Nalini smiled back. &quot;I'm glad you understand. I'm sure there are some things we can teach you without taking your clothes off. Come and see us afterwards. I'll think about whether we could teach Rupert anything as well, otherwise you'll have to teach him.&quot;
The precession took about half an hour to wind its way into the city center. We rode along a tree-lined avenue to the square. The square was crowded, I had no idea where they would keep all the horses. Cleaning up after so many horses would be a major job. We might complain about cars polluting, but so do animals, and their pollution is usually more immediately offensive.
In the center of the square is a large fountain with naked nymphs playing and spraying water over each other. There are also a few naked men playing with them, and two of them had obvious erections. The puritans might not be amused as they rode past.
There were barricades to keep the crowds away from the middle of the square, and passage to the temple. The procession was stalled here as those at the head dismounted, and gave their mounts into the care of grooms. We inched forward, and then it was our turn to dismount. We were near the main steps to the temple, and already the area was fouled with horse dung. There were several people scurrying around trying to clear it away, but with several hundred horses still to come, they would be busy.
The grooms led our horses around the right of the temple, presumably to some temporary holding yard. The barricades were only a few meters away, and behind the barricades was a sea of faces, cheering, pointing, and waving. People seemed to know of us, we picked up references to out names.
&quot;Hey Liz, if you've ever wondered what it'd be like to be a famous rock star, this is part of it.&quot;
&quot;It's different, but I don't know if I'd like this sort of treatment every day. Jeez, it'd make going for a walk hard.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, but a lot more of them will recognize us after this.&quot;
&quot;At least we don't have to contend with the paparazzi taking pictures.&quot; Nalini added.
&quot;People here are more deferential toward nobles.&quot; Paula added. &quot;They won't crowd you out and ask for your autograph. But you have to be careful in shops, because a lot of shopkeepers will try to give you the goods for free, then advertise that you shop there.&quot;
The temple is large, cathedral like, and round. The altar is in the center, with a high dome above it, and set into the dome are circular windows, cunningly designed so that a beam of sunlight is let onto the altar during the service. The roof is high, supported by huge columns, the groined ceiling is covered with religious frescoes, as are the walls. The central altar was covered with white cloth, and taking pride of place was a stand with a large solar disk of solid gold. On the left side of the altar were two crowns, covered with cloth-of-gold. On the right side of the altar were several jewel encrusted golden goblets, and a large gold jug that presumably contained wine. The jug was shaped like a bull's head, complete with curving horns.
Like most cathedrals, there are no fixed seats. For this occasion, seating had been provided for the guests. We were shown to a high backed trestle seat with cushions, we were seated part way round, left of the central isle, about nine rows from the front. My impression was that the best seats were in the segment in front of the altar, the cheap seats were behind the altar, along with the musicians and choir, where many lesser nobles had to stand.
The seats were not arranged in simple rows as in most churches, but were grouped so that members of noble houses could sit together, with gaps between each grouping. King Charles and his group were situated to the right of the main isle, passing comments among each other.
Amrik and Enyil were seated in two very ornate chairs of carved dark wood, with red velvet cushions. They were situated to the left of the altar, but on the dais, facing us. I noticed that Amrik had removed his crown, and that Enyil had removed her tiara. The priest was dressed in flowing white robes, with a huge gold breastplate carved with a solar disk.
The service was sort of interesting, and bore some resemblance to services I have attended back home. The priest spoke, or read passages from scripture, the musicians played while the choir sang. An assistant walked through the congregation with a golden censor. After about half an hour of this, the priest poured wine into a goblet, raised the goblet and intoned a blessing, after which drank some, and then gave some to Amrik and Enyil. Assistants came, poured wine into the other goblets, and then the congregation was invited to partake. We had been instructed previously that since we were not members of the religion, we should stay in our seats. Music played and hymns were sung while the wine was distributed.
After this, the marriage ceremony was conducted. The Viharani couple I did not know turned out to be Enyil's parents; they presented Enyil to the priest. Prospero and his mother stood in for Amrik's parents, and presented Amrik to the priest. The couple knelt before the altar and exchanged their marriage vows, while the priest stood behind them with a hand on each head. Then the couple stood and briefly faced the congregation, before kneeling again.
The priest went to the alter, uncovered the crowns. These were different from the one worn by Amrik on the way in: both were studded with precious gems, and each one bore a circular solar disk that stood above the rest of the crown. He blessed each crown, and raised it above his head in both hands. Then the priest handed one crown to Amrik, who placed the crown on his own head. Then Amrik stood, and together with the priest, placed the second crown on Enyil's head.
Then the priest turned to the congregation and announced in a loud voice &quot;In the name of Mithras, I present to you the king and queen of Aquilonia. May their reign be long and just, may their union be loving and fruitful!&quot;
At this the congregation broke into applause, and we could hear echoes from outside. It was only now that I realized there was a man in Prospero's livery who was running around with an expensive camera, taking pictures. I hoped he was using high-speed film, because he wasn't using the flash.
Amrik lead Enyil to her throne then sat himself while the priest intoned the closing prayers. After this the priest raised his right hand in benediction and blessed the assembled congregation. Amrik stood, walked from the dais, and then hugged Prospero and then Prospero's mother. He made his way through the congregation to where we were sitting, and hugged Nalini and then me and then Paula. Enyil followed and did the same. It occurred to me that this would send a major signal to the assembled nobles - Nalini and I were his trusted friends, almost on par with Prospero.
After this, he made a point of going to each noble house, and embracing the head of the house, and each visiting king. Finally he took Enyil's hand, and led her down the aisle and through the door, while we all clapped. When they emerged from the main doors, there was a huge roar from the crowd that seemed to go on and on, like a grand final crowd when the winning goal is scored.
The rest of us filed out in the same order in which we had filed in. When we emerged, we discovered that Amrik and Enyil had been walking slowly down the route of the procession, greeting the crowds.
&quot;I wonder if any of the visiting kings have this sort of popularity back home?&quot; I commented.
&quot;I doubt it.&quot; Nalini replied. &quot;This might be something of an eye-opener for them.&quot;
I looked around for king Charles and the others. Charles and Rupert were talking, as were Cromwell and Matthew. My translation spell was running, and one of its properties is that by focussing my attention on someone talking I can usually pick up what they are saying.
Rupert was commenting &quot;...return as the victorious monarch who does away with the witch persecutions your popularity will rise. But do not forget he deposed a tyrant, and he is giving the people a voice in their government.&quot;
Charles replied &quot;Perhaps I should talk with duke Prospero about things that can be to improve my popularity. This civil war should never have started it has...&quot;
I turned my attention to Cromwell and Matthew. Matthew was commenting &quot;...should praise god that Charles is not that popular.&quot;
&quot;That popinjay never could command respect for his person, only for his office! We will obtain most of what we want from these negotiations, though we may need assistance from the Aquilonians to keep Charles docile.&quot;
&quot;What we do not achieve through these negotiations we can put on the agenda for parliamentary government. These Aquilonians are an odd people, but their rulers seem to be trying to do what is best for their people. I think we can make their ideas for parliamentary government work in England.&quot;
&quot;And clip Charles' wings! With that accomplishedà&quot; I turned my attention away.
Amrik and Enyil continued walking along the processional route. When the rest of the procession was mounted, we followed behind. The king and queen did not remount, but walked the entire route.
The rest of the day was devoted to feasting and celebrations. The celebrations would last for days, but Amrik and Enyil were departing that afternoon, and would not be back for two weeks. During their absence Prospero would be regent.
Nalini and I shared a table with the Amrik and Enyil at the wedding breakfast that was really a luncheon, but due to the table arrangement, we did not have much opportunity to talk with them. We did have conversations with most of the major nobles and many of the minor nobles, who seemed to make a point of singling us out to speak with us. The significance of the fact that Amrik had hugged us after Prospero had not been lost on any of them.
We already knew most of the, at least by sight. All were polite, urbane, as people tend to be at these sorts of functions. What they really thought of two upstart nobles pushing them all down a peg they would of course not even hint at in our presence.
Before Amrik and Enyil left, we did invite them to visit us back in shadow Brisbane.
Amrik replied &quot;First we must get these English back home, and set up our embassy. Our visit to Brisbane must wait. But you will be at your estates next week, will you not? I've a mind to drop in there on the way back, and tarry for a few days.&quot;
&quot;You will be more than welcome. I think Prospero and Paula will be there as well.&quot; I did not add that at some stage all the English and the Viharani would also be there. Hopefully they'd all have gone by the time the king and queen arrived.
&quot;I hope they will, Prospero and I might go hunting while we are there. I haven't been hunting for months!&quot;
I smiled back at him. &quot;I take it that means the hunting is good?&quot;
&quot;It will be excellent, as you will see. Well, we will talk more at Bendora. Duty calls I am afraid. We hugged him, hugged and kissed Enyil, and wished them well. They moved on to say their farewells to other nobles.
A little later, Cromwell came over to talk with Nalini and me. &quot;You may not be aware of it, but I owe you an apology. I had thought you little more than minor nobles and at worst brigands when you took us from England. Little did I realize that you and duke Prospero were King Amrik's favorites, and the two most important nobles in the kingdom of Aquilonia.&quot;
We both smiled at his honest way of trying to curry favor. Nalini replied innocently &quot;Why Lord Cromwell, does this mean you are judging us by our worldly titles and not our achievements?&quot;
He smiled in return. &quot;Oh no lady Nalini, in this case your titles and the king's high regard for the two of you highlights your achievements. You did not gain these titles by accident of birth, but earned them in service of the king. I have a very high regard for that.&quot;
&quot;And did not you also earn the title Lord Protector? We have a high regard for your achievements, though you may not know it.&quot; I guess we were learning the art of politics, or at least being politic.
There was a twinkle in Cromwell's eye as he replied. &quot;Oh, you have not been open about it, but I have deduced that. Normally you treat all of us as equals, showing no regard for rank or title. That commands my respect, that you can treat a king and a common soldier as your equals. King Amrik is similar, he treats any commoner he meets as if he is as important as any noble. I have no doubt that this counts much toward his popularity. He is noble, in a way that most nobles will never understand. I only wish that we had a king like that, for none of our troubles would ever have arisen.&quot;
Nalini nodded. &quot;Amrik is one of the few truly noble people I have met. People sense that, and respond accordingly.&quot;
I added &quot;But Amrik and Prospero deposed a tyrant in a civil war, the same war that claimed Amrik's family and Prospero's father. When we met him, he was looking for a better alternative to rule by a despotic king. In our own country we have over three hundred years of parliamentary democracy, set up by your namesake.&quot; Cromwell's eyebrows raised at that. &quot;We may criticize our form of government, but it works much better than any other form we have seen.&quot;
&quot;I believe that a parliament of the people is perhaps the fairest and most just form of government we can conceive of. From talking with you about your own government, you convince me that what we are trying to do in England will be a just and honorable solution.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;You are an astute man Lord Cromwell. But how did you deduce that we respect you more than king Charles? I thought we rebuke you even more than Charles.&quot;
&quot;Ah, it is true that you have rebuked most of us, but there has always been a just or spiritual basis for your rebukes, they are never arbitrary. When you speak with king Charles, you explain, whereas with me you argue. By that I deduce that my opinions are more important to you than those of king Charles. You do not care whether the king agrees with you or not, but you care that I should agree with you. Have I said enough?&quot;
We hadn't thought of our behavior in those terms. As Nalini said, Cromwell himself was very observant and astute, traits to be expected from someone who had earned the title Lord Protector. He had also decided to get on-side with us. &quot;We know much about what you were trying to achieve, and we agree with many of your aims. Some we do not agree with, as you know.&quot; Cromwell nodded. &quot;It was unfortunate that you were lead astray by demons, but god has since opened your eyes, there is no shame in that.&quot;
&quot;No, there is shame in being lead astray. But as you say, god has opened our eyes, and when we return to England we will rectify our error.&quot;
&quot;Also, there are three hundred years of development of theology and spiritual thought between us, some of the things you take for granted we are appalled at.&quot;
Cromwell commented &quot;That is possibly the hardest notion for me to accept. Your statement makes you to be superior, more spiritually developed than I. I cannot concede that, but I am willing to discuss those developments with you.&quot;
&quot;We are quite happy to discuss that with you. I think you will find that Durathror is also. But we can't fault you for being a product of your culture, I'm sure that there are attitudes we have that would appall more spiritually developed people. Maybe we shouldn't interfere, but Danny and I think we can't just leave things alone when we can do something to help people.&quot;
&quot;As a Christian, you must be proactive.&quot; Cromwell responded. &quot;If your attitudes are different from ours, then we must all study the bible to determine what Jesus taught on the matter. I really do want to discuss the issues you have raised with yourselves and Prince Durathror.&quot;
At this point Matthew and Thomas joined us. &quot;We would like to be involved in any such discussions as well. I believe we can contribute, and we can learn.&quot;
&quot;We will find time for such discussions.&quot; I commented. &quot;But tell me, what are your thoughts about the negotiations? I heard a rumor that you are happy with them.&quot;
The others looked to Cromwell. He looked thoughtful for a moment before he replied. &quot;Let me say that my discussions with you and duke Prospero and king Amrik the other night have convinced me that what you are proposing can be made to work in England. It is largely in accord with what we were attempting to set up; I believe that we are heading in the right direction. We never wanted to depose the monarch, but he started the civil war by threatening us with his troops. I am surprised that he has agreed to parliament curbing his powers like that.&quot;
Matthew commented sardonically &quot;He'll wriggle like an eel the moment he's back in England, and repudiate all his promises.&quot;
&quot;We know&quot; I replied &quot;but that is where Prospero's guarantees come in. He's still working out exactly how to implement them, but as far as I'm aware, the changes you all agree to will be implemented when you return, and we will be there for a time to oversee the transition and help if needed. Once the structures are in place, he can wriggle all he likes, but he won't be able to undo them. But neither will you.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Right now, I think that Charles has had the fear of god put into him. He nearly lost his head over his stupid civil war, and he knows that at present we represent the best chance he has of regaining the throne. Like you said Matthew, he will promise what ever is necessary to get back to England and his throne.&quot;
I continued &quot;Once things are set up and working, we can hand everything over to the government, and let things run their normal course. I think Amrik and Prospero want some sort of treaty of mutual friendship and trade, and would want to set up an embassy in England. England of course would send an ambassador to Aquilonia.&quot;
Cromwell responded &quot;We will have a treaty and exchange ambassadors. But we must take care that we do not corrupt England's moral fiber.&quot;
I chuckled and shook my head. &quot;Lord Cromwell, since none of you English will be able to travel between parallel earths, contact between our two cultures will be severely limited. I think Amrik is more in favor of exchange of ideas between his government and yours. The general populace won't know much about Aquilonia at all. Our respective governments will filter what exchange there is.&quot;
Cromwell nodded &quot;That is acceptable. The government must always control ideas.&quot;
&quot;As long as the government is subject to the will of the people, then that is acceptable, because the government then reflects community standards. But when you have a few autocrats deciding what ideas will be allowed out into the public arena, then you have tyranny and despotism.&quot;
We had a free exchange of ideas, as reporters often write of political discussions. In other words we argued about rights of people versus powers of government, obligations of people versus obligations of government, and a whole lot of side issues. I don't think the puritans agreed that often, but many of the ideas Nalini and I canvassed were new to them. There was no point pressing the issues, they had to be given the information, and then had to go away and think about them.
Eventually we all resolved we had discussed enough for one day, and would continue at a later date. They had just stood up to leave, when Prospero and Paula came over, accompanied by Rupert and Liz whom they had collected on the way.
&quot;You guys want to hang around, or would you prefer to go?&quot; I asked. I was sick of having to make polite conversation.
&quot;We've only just returned.&quot; Prospero answered. He was carrying some sheets of paper. Paula snapped her fingers, and a waiter appeared at her elbow. She gave him some orders, and he went away.
Prospero dropped the sheaf of papers in front of us. &quot;Have a look at this!&quot;
This was four sheets of paper, folded in half, stapled in the center like a magazine. It looked like a miniaturized newspaper, complete with masthead, black and white printing in two columns and pictures of the wedding. Unfortunately the printing was in Aquilonian writing. There were a number of copies in the stack.
Cromwell leaned over to look at the newspaper I held. &quot;This is some kind of news sheet, is it not?&quot;
Prospero was grinning with the air of someone who has just performed some feat of magic. &quot;Correct lord Cromwell. I print a weekly newspaper. Usually I limit it to two sheets of paper for eight pages, but this one covers the royal wedding, so several pages are devoted to pictures of the wedding. It will be selling on the streets tomorrow morning for half a silver piece, it always sells out.&quot;
&quot;We're impressed. What do you use to print this?&quot;
&quot;Ah, the camera ready copy is done on our PC, printed on a laser printer, then that goes into the camera process that makes the printing-plates, then we run off several thousand copies.&quot;
&quot;So what do you use for power?&quot;
The waiter returned with goblets and two flasks of wine. He poured the wine and gave it to the six of us. He looked at Cromwell who shook his head. &quot;Just water thank you.&quot;
Prospero replied &quot;The press is steam powered, the computer and other electronics are powered by batteries. They are recharged by solar power, but there is also a small steam powered generator we can use in emergencies.&quot;
Rupert commented &quot;I have a passing familiarity with the printing press, but some of the terms you mentioned are quite beyond my comprehension.&quot;
&quot;Ah, the computer and laser printer are technology from Danny and Nalini's world, neither your world nor ours has the ability to build them yet. Electronics will take some time to develop, we do not have the science to understand. We use them to produce the first copy, laid out correctly. It means that the time between writing the articles and deciding on the layout, and producing the plates for printing can be much reduced. Otherwise we could never have produced these the same afternoon.&quot;
To us he added &quot;Originally we printed all the copies on the laser printer, but it is not capable of high speed printing like a press is. It proved the paper was saleable though.&quot;
Cromwell commented &quot;The pictures are very lifelike. I am impressed. Whoever drew them is an excellent artist.&quot;
&quot;It's a shame none of us can read Aquilonian.&quot; Nalini commented. Who does the writing? Who does the typing?&quot;
&quot;Originally it was me with help from Paula. Her Aquilonian is not good enough to let her write articles yet. Now I have two scribes who are employed to collect news, write articles, and we decide what to include the day before the print run. Paula does most of the typing and layout. There are two people employed to look after the press and run it, and then we have between twenty and thirty people who sell the paper on street corners.&quot;
Cromwell handed the paper back. &quot;This is obviously the way of the future. Our newssheets are usually only a single sheet, but I can see this happening in England. I think we might be advised to do what you are doing, and control the process from the government. Matthew, do we know any parliamentarian who might be interested in printing newssheets?&quot;
&quot;I do not know of any, but I am sure we can find one. Now if you will excuse me, I really must go, call of nature.&quot; Matthew left with this.
Prospero commented &quot;We report on government decisions, and any other events that might be of popular interest, including major sporting events.&quot;
Cromwell laughed. &quot;Our newssheets tend to be printed by people critical of the government. I can see advantages if we can arrange to print one by the government. I wonder why we never thought of it before?&quot;
Prospero observed &quot;I suspect that most of your nobles are not well educated, and those that are tend to be traditionalists. Most of them would think that trade is beneath them. I have studied things that have been developed in Danny and Nalini's world, now I am in the process of adapting some of their inventions to our world. Prince Rupert, Lord Cromwell, would either of you like to look at our press?&quot;
Cromwell shook his head. &quot;Thank you, but no. Technology is not something I understand well. I think I have taken up enough of Earl Daniel and Lady Nalini's time today. I shall be going.&quot; He drank his glass of water, and departed.
Rupert was more enthusiastic. &quot;I am interested in technology, especially the application of steam power. It is something I do understand. I would like to look at your press. But tell me, how did you get the pictures so lifelike?&quot;
Prospero smiled. &quot;I'm glad you asked me something I understand. Computers and electronics I do not understand, though one day I will. Photography I do understand. It is essentially a straight forward mechanical and chemical process, I think you will understand also.&quot; He launched into a detailed explanation of photography.
I asked Paula &quot;What about the printing using Aquilonian writing? I'm sure that isn't a font option you can buy back home.&quot;
She smiled proudly. &quot;I set that up! You can buy software to design fonts, I had to learn how to do that.&quot;
I remembered now that Paula had been asking questions about creating fonts a couple of months ago. I'd answered her as best I could, and promptly forgotten about it. &quot;I remember now. You've done a good job.&quot;
&quot;I'm surprised you didn't tell us about this before.&quot; Nalini commented.
&quot;Oh, I wanted to, but it was Prospero's big secret. He went off with Durathror looking for equipment. You know he's been learning how to use computers back home. He worked out what he wanted, then went off and bought it.&quot;
Later, Prospero lead us through his printing press. He led us through a locked door into a room where there was a single computer with twenty one inch screen, a high resolution laser printer, and next to it was a scanner. An uninterruptible power supply stood in on corner, with a cable snaking through the barred window to the solar panels on the roof. There were several desks and chairs and a large filing cabinet.
Prospero showed us some large capacity removable hard disk cartridges. &quot;I've followed your advice Danny. We use these for backup, and a second copy goes to my rooms for off-site backup. The scanner is used for photos, Paula types in the stories, then we sit down and layout the newspaper using a desktop publishing program. Then we print the pages here on the laser printer. Rupert, I don't understand how all this works, but I know how to use it.&quot; He held up two sheets of paper stuck together with clear sticky tape. &quot;This is what we want to end up with, this is the camera ready copy. It could be anything, including a hand written manuscript. What happens after this stage I am sure you could do in England. All you need is the equipment, the chemicals which can be manufactured, and the paper and ink.&quot;
He led us back into the corridor, and into the next room. This one was large, and partly filled with machinery. He indicated a camera lens mounted in a frame. &quot;This is what makes the plates for printing. The camera ready artwork goes here&quot; he placed the sheets face up on the table &quot;and then we line up the camera correctly and take a photo. This gives us a negative image, which we use to make the printing plate from. If you want to print less than about a thousand copies, you can use paper masters, but they wear out somewhere around fifteen hundred copies, and the last couple of hundred are blurry. We are running off about three thousand copies at present, I was considering using metal plates. However, that requires acid for etching, and quite a few nasty chemicals, so instead we make three paper plates, and print a thousand copies from each. The paper plate is coated with a special photographic emulsion, it goes in here. Once it has been exposed, it is developed and etched. The black bits on the copy here don't reflect light, so that part of the image doesn't react when it's exposed, but the white parts cause the emulsion to react to the light. When it's developed, the parts that reacted wash off, we collect that and recycle it. The emulsion that did not react solidifies into a metallic deposit on the paper. That means that the white parts remain as clean paper in the plate, the black parts are raised. It's the raised parts that take the ink.&quot;
He pointed to a door near by. &quot;In there is my dark room.&quot; He opened the door, showed us shelves with tanks, drums of fluid, shelves piled with paper. He flicked a switch and lit everything with a soft red glow. &quot;I can do all the photographic developing and printing right here. Admittedly the equipment comes from Danny and Nalini's world, but I am considering what can be produced here. At present I'm the only user, so I'm happy to buy what I need and import it.&quot;
Prince Rupert asked more questions. Prospero finally ushered us all in, closed the door, and went through the process of printing a photo from a negative. &quot;The baths have to be kept at the correct temperature, so I use electricity for that. We use red light because the paper isn't sensitive to it. Otherwise I could never see what I was doing.&quot; Rupert watched open mouthed as the image appeared on the paper in the tray of developing liquid. Prospero fixed it, washed it, then hung the wet photo up to dry. &quot;We'll come back when it's dry.&quot;
He switched off the light and led us to where some old plates were stored. &quot;These have ink on them, so be careful, but you'll get the idea. The plate goes in the machine, the machine coats the plate with ink, presses a sheet of paper against it, and we have a printed copy. We can run off as many copies as we like simply by creating extra masters. We collect all the old plates, and used chemicals, and take them back to Danny's world for recycling. Eventually we will do all that here, but we need to understand the technology first.&quot;
He led us over to the press itself, where two men tended it. Sheets of paper went in one hopper, the printed pages were deposited into another. There was a tank for the ink. On the other side of the room was the steam engine that supplied motive power to a pulley. That turned a crankshaft that ran across the ceiling, and then via more pulleys turned the press.
Prince Rupert asked a few questions, which Prospero tried to answer. Prospero finished with &quot;Eventually I will move to a fully electronic method, where the plates are made electronically, and no chemicals are needed. It will work something like a laser printer, except that the laser printer drum is only good for about fifty thousand copies, while the fully electronic printer is good for millions of copies. Then there will be no chemicals to recycle, just ink to purchase.&quot;
Prince Rupert remarked &quot;I do not fully understand everything, but the making of the plates onwards makes sense to me. We use a system of moveable type, I think that once upon a time our printing presses did use fixed plates, except they had to be carved by hand. I would most like to know how the press operates once a plate is in it, because the use of steam to automate the press would mean that many copies could be produced very swiftly. I think this is well within our own technology. Photography seems too complicated for now.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;The print run will finish later tonight. We could come back when the boys are stripping the machine down to clean it, you'll get to see how it works then.&quot;
Rupert nodded &quot;I would like that. Thank you.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;This is the only printing press in the kingdom at present. I don't know why no one ever thought of the concept before, but no one has. Like you, I started with the idea that steam power was closer to my own level, but it is a dirtier technology than electronics. On the other hand, we can repair this equipment here, but the electronic stuff has to be taken back to Danny's world. I have no problem with importing electronic technology I need, but at some stage we need to advance our science to the point where we understand how this works. I don't think we need to be able to make all of it here, if you look at Danny and Nalini's world, electronic goods are manufactured in only a few places, and transported around their world.&quot;
I think this was a little beyond Rupert's experience, for he nodded and said nothing. I asked &quot;Are you making a profit?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; he grinned &quot;but I'm enjoying myself.&quot;
&quot;Are you planning on expanding to print books all sorts of things?&quot;
&quot;Of course, but we need to stimulate a demand for the printed word first. I intend to set up a complete publishing and printing house, publish all the books, magazines, periodicals and a daily newspaper. This is the pilot process if you like. But we will need to build a heavy-duty electronic generator, and you know what that means? Electric light, a power grid, refrigerators, televisions, computers and all that.&quot;
&quot;I would like to know more about this electricity.&quot; Rupert asked.
I wasn't sure where to start. He probably had about seven years of science education to learn. Prospero replied &quot;I'll explain what I can. I even have a book on the subject back in my rooms; I've read it, but I only understood about half of it.&quot; He launched into an explanation of rotating magnets inside wire coils, and the basics behind batteries. That took a while.
I added &quot;Rupert, one day we will explain how a computer works, but before then, you need about seven years of schooling to get to a point where you will understand the explanation. You can read English, we will start you with some books, and you can work your way through at your own pace....&quot;
&quot;...But you will also need to visit our world, because many of the things you will read about will make no sense otherwise.&quot; Nalini added.
Rupert spread his arms disarmingly. &quot;I have no way of travelling there, but if one of you are willing to convey me, I would be pleased to visit.&quot;
&quot;We'll be pleased to have you. It's a lot different from here though...&quot;
&quot;...and it may have to wait until the situation in England has stabilized. Will the king want you around him when we return you?&quot;
Rupert shrugged &quot;I do not know. But if you promise you will bring me to your world and show me things, then I will be content to wait until the time is ripe.&quot;
Nalini smiled &quot;We promise that prince Rupert. You have become a friend of ours.&quot;
&quot;Prospero, are you planning on doing color printing, or just black and white?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Black and white is simpler, most of what I plan to print will be black and white. But the same press will print color if need be.&quot;
&quot;How do you print color?&quot; Rupert asked.
&quot;Essentially the same as black and white, except that you make a plate for each color and pass the paper through once for each color. Of course, you will do a run with one color, say green, then another color, say red, and you have to clean the machine between colors.&quot;
Rupert shook his head. &quot;But there must be hundreds of colors. Do you need hundreds of plates? And how do you make each plate different?&quot;
Prospero smiled &quot;It's a lot simpler than that. If you talk to an artist, they may produce twenty or thirty different colors in a painting, but they will use perhaps four or five main ones they mix to produce the range of colors. It's the same in printing, most colors can be made by mixing three primary colors, red, yellow and blue, plus black. You need the computer or you need the camera to do this though, because to mix the inks when you print you need a plate made up with many small raised dots, and the dots for one color must be slightly offset from the dots of a second color. I believe it can be done by hand if you are a skilled artist. The computer can do it for us, and will print one copy for each color. I read that the camera can also be used if you place a red glass over the lens and make a plate, then a yellow glass and make a second plate. But there are some difficulties with that. How do you convert an area of one color into a set of raised dots? I don't know. The computer will print the color separation with small black dots, which the camera can copy to the plate. You also need to ensure that the different plates line up, and that the paper is placed in exactly the same position each time a different color is printed. Electronic technology does it all for you, but we don't have that yet.&quot;
Rupert looked impressed. He was even more impressed when Prospero showed him some color photographs of the wedding, including the one he had developed. The two of them began discussing photography.
&quot;I think Prospero is going to convert Rupert to a camera buff.&quot;
Liz shrugged. &quot;Rupert is a lot like Prospero actually, have you guys noticed?&quot;
Paula looked wide-eyed, her little miss innocent look. &quot;I hadn't noticed, but I guess you've been spending a lot more time with him Liz.&quot;
&quot;I've noticed the similarity Paula.&quot; Nalini commented &quot;They are both nobles in line to a throne, but they will never sit on that throne, they have both fought as generals in a civil war, they are both essentially decent chaps, they are both interested in typical boy things like gee whiz technology, they are from societies with a similar level of technology. They aren't the same, but there are a lot of similarities between them. I'm sure the two of them will wind up being firm friends.&quot;
Paula winked at Liz. &quot;You could wind up with a German Prince huh?&quot;
Liz shrugged. &quot;He's nice. We need to get to know each other a lot better first. He'll probably be disappointed if he gets to meet my family. I don't know Paula, I'm not looking to get married for years yet. I just want to enjoy myself for a while.&quot;

After the amount of food we'd eaten for lunch, we ate sparely for dinner. After dinner, Rupert and Prospero headed back to the office to watch the printer being dismantled and cleaned. The four of us headed back to our apartments.
Nalini stated &quot;Liz, we said we'd teach you what we could about energy sharing. Now is as good a time as any.&quot;
&quot;Er... okay.&quot;
&quot;Can I stay and watch?&quot; Paula asked, a suggestive leer on her face.
&quot;We might use you as a model.&quot; Nalini suggested. &quot;You can be the one to strip!&quot;
&quot;Oh yeah? Does this mean I get to practice with Danny?&quot;
&quot;Within limits you little minx.&quot; Nalini was smiling as she spoke. &quot;You wouldn't want Prospero to walk in on you doing things, now would you?&quot;
&quot;Hey, you guys are chaperones! What kind of a girl do you think I am?!&quot;
&quot;I think we already know.&quot; Nalini responded. &quot;Look what happened last time I was chaperone.&quot;
&quot;Oh... er... yeah, we don't have to go that far!&quot; The little miss innocent look was back.
&quot;No. Danny, do you want to do the talking?&quot;
&quot;Okay. Let's see. Liz, you know about the main energy centers, the chakras. They act as channels to conduct energy from outside us. There are seven major chakras, they correspond to what we call the seven colors, or the seven great bands. Each chakra has its own energy channeled from its great band. The lowest band is the physical, with the color red, then next band is the world of dreaming, with the color orange. The others bands we are not that familiar with as yet.&quot;
&quot;You've shown you some exercises for each chakra, and one to cause energy to flow between all of them.&quot;
&quot;The energy flows are actually more complicated than that. There are meridians all over your body where energy flows, with small centers along each line. It's a bit like acupuncture and Japanese shiatsu, but you don't have to learn all those centers yet. Most of them are side issues to what we do, but we believe it helps to know about them.&quot;
&quot;You don't mean like sticking needles in do you? And what's Japanese what-you-may-call-it?&quot;
&quot;No, you don't go sticking needles in, that's a very crude form of stimulation. Japanese shiatsu is similar to acupuncture, except that you use pressure rather than needles, so it's sometimes called acupressure. I'll get to the meridians a bit later. The most important thing is that males and females for want of a better word color the energies they channel, but the color is different for each sex. What needs to happen is that male and female energies are balanced; this is done by exchanging energies between a male and a female.&quot;
&quot;You're talking sex aren't you?&quot;
&quot;Yes and no. You don't have to have sex, but the energy exchange leads to sexual arousal, and sex, especially orgasm, helps the balancing process. We find that energy channeling combined with sex leads to a point where the first and even second orgasm helps the build up, and the third one completes the process.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;You don't have sex for the sake of the orgasm, you use sex to help the energies flow. The orgasm is a side effect of the flow, until the energies are in balance. The hard part about explaining this is you really have to be doing it to understand fully. We'll talk about how to build up the energies.&quot;
She held her palms out to me, I held my palms about three or four inches away from hers, right to left and left to right. Liz already knew about this exercise. I spoke &quot;Liz, one of the ways is to stimulate the chakras. This can be done by gentle massaging the area, or lightly scratching it with your fingernails or fingertips, or sucking on it with your lips and tongue, or even directing a flow of energy onto it.&quot; It didn't take long for the energy flows between Nalini and me to become quite noticeable.
&quot;Now Liz, the chakra most involved in sex, and physical well being for that matter, is the basal chakra. In females, that is situated in the area between the vagina and the anus. In men, it is between their balls and their anus. The basal chakra is the one most easy to stimulate. Clothes generally don't impede the energy flows, but they do make it more difficult to locate a chakra.&quot; This was a delicate moment. &quot;We won't ask you to undress, and I'm not going to touch you, but I do need you to slide down in the chair and spread your legs.&quot;
&quot;Um...&quot; she looked at us, then Paula. &quot;No comments, okay?&quot;
Paula smiled. &quot;This is serious Liz, I won't make any remarks. Besides, Danny showed me this.&quot;
&quot;And Nalini showed me.&quot; Liz slid down in her chair, and spread her legs. She was wearing trousers. I placed my hand between her knees, palm facing her vulva, and moved slowly toward her until I could feel her energies. My palm was about six inches from her body. I moved my palm back and forwards so that she would feel my energies interact with hers, then stop, then back again. &quot;I can feel the energy from your basal chakra. You should be able to feel the energy from my hand.&quot;
&quot;It does feel sort of tingly. That's weird!&quot;
I moved my hand forward another three inches. I could feel her energies as warmth, and the warmth was growing. She would soon start to notice that she was becoming sexually aroused. &quot;What do you feel now?&quot;
&quot;It's warmer, like you're touching me. But I can see you're not.&quot; She closed her eyes. &quot;This is weird, I'd swear you have your hand on me.&quot;
&quot;He doesn't&quot; Paula remarked. &quot;Liz, you should be starting to feel excited, you might even be starting to get wet.&quot;
&quot;Oh!&quot; Liz looked a little embarrassed. &quot;Er... yeah. I think you're right.&quot;
&quot;Now you see why it is hard to teach this stuff unless you're in a sexual relationship with your teacher.&quot;
Nalini moved beside me. &quot;Liz, we want you to close your eyes for a moment, and see what you can feel.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot;
I slid my hand away. Liz wiggled slightly, and looked a little disappointed. &quot;You've removed your hand.&quot;
&quot;That's right.&quot; Nalini slid her hand in between Liz's legs in place of mine, at about the same distance.
&quot;Oh, that's almost unpleasant.&quot;
&quot;Open your eyes. At least we know you're not a lesbian.&quot; Nalini commented with a smile.
Liz opened her eyes. &quot;Oh, it's you Nalini! Why does it feel unpleasant?&quot;
Nalini grinned, removed her hand. &quot;You've lost your sexual excitement. Imladril told me it always had to be male female, that you can't balance energies between two people of the same sex. Now you know that is true. I'm not sure about homosexuals, they might be able to balance their energies with each other, but none of us girls can. We need a man for that. You can put your legs together now.&quot;
&quot;Thanks!&quot; She looked relieved.
&quot;Liz, it's important that you can find your own chakras, and those of your partner. You should really stimulate all of his, and he should stimulate all of yours.&quot;
&quot;I think I know where they are. How do you stimulate them? Like you did with your hand?&quot;
&quot;That's one way. But don't overlook physical contact. You can gently rake them with your fingernails, you can massage then gently, you can kiss them, lick them, or suck on them. These are techniques that work for us, they should work for you and your partner.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Liz, can you show us where your second chakra is? Just move your clothes enough to show us.&quot;
&quot;Jeez, I'm glad you didn't ask me to do that with my base chakra!&quot; She lifted her shirt, unbuckled her trousers to show her navel. &quot;It's just below my belly button isn't it?&quot;
&quot;Yes, about an inch to two inches.&quot; Nalini responded. &quot;It's involved in sexual excitement, so stimulating it is also sexually arousing. This chakra is also the power center for shape shifting. One day if you develop enough power you'll learn about that. Danny, do you want to demonstrate some arousal techniques on me?&quot;
She sat back in her chair, lifted her shirt and undid her trousers. I demonstrated the use of fingernails, fingertips, palm of the right hand, lips and tongue. Then Nalini asked &quot;Liz, can Danny show these on you?&quot;
&quot;Uh... Just as long as Rupert doesn't walk in the door.&quot;
Paula responded &quot;He won't. I've told the servants to warn us when they come up the stairs.&quot;
&quot;It's important that you experience for yourself what happens, that way you'll be able to guide your partner to do it right.&quot; Nalini added.
&quot;Okay, go ahead Danny.&quot; Behind her, Paula smirked.
I knelt before Liz, and proceeded to demonstrate on her second chakra. I was well aware that Liz was becoming aroused again. Nalini commented &quot;Liz, you can try this on Rupert tonight, and get him to try the same to you. You can stimulate any of the chakras like that, the basal one is a good one for finger nails and finger tips, or if the area is clean, lips and tongue. But you'll have to experiment with Rupert, we're not going to do that. Did you want to try any of that on Danny, or would you rather wait? You do need feedback on whether what you are doing is right. &quot;
Liz looked happy, pleased with herself. &quot;If you and Danny don't mind, I suppose I should.&quot;
Liz did need practice. I guided her how to do it better, and also how to feel some feedback for herself. Then I asked &quot;All right Liz, can you show us where your third chakra is?&quot;
She stood up and lifted her shirt. &quot;It's my solar plexus isn't it?&quot;
&quot;Yes. Stimulating this one isn't sexually arousing, but the energies can spill over and stimulate the lower chakras. This is the chakra you use in shadow shifting.&quot;
We went through each of the chakras one by one, ensuring that Liz knew how to find it, and how to stimulate it. In the time we had available, there was no way we could give a complete course, this was just the basics. But then, Liz needed to start with the basics, and learn at her own pace.
Then Nalini and I demonstrated some sexual techniques, but fully clothed. Instructions are good, but actual practice is better. Liz gained the benefits of the concepts, without the actual doing that would enable her to repeat it.
&quot;For some reason, I keep thinking of a Monty Python skit where John Cleese is teaching sex education to a group of school kids, and he brings his wife in and goes through an actual demonstration.&quot;
Liz looked blank, but Paula commented &quot;I think I've seen that on video. They both get their clothes off, start having sex, and John Cleese is describing everything in a sort of bored clinical fashion. Don't worry, you two don't sound bored or clinical.&quot;
&quot;How am I going to remember all this?&quot; Liz asked.
&quot;Don't worry, just practice what you can remember, and ask for refresher pointers from time to time. Half the fun is practicing it and trying new things. You'll find you get a feel for what works.&quot;
We were interrupted by the servant announcing Prospero's return, and turned immediately to plan B, prepared by Paula. When Prospero and Rupert arrived the four of us were in the middle of a game of mahjong.
Both men had ink and grease smeared on their hands and faces. Paula complained &quot;Did you boys have to go and get dirty? And in your good clothes too!&quot;
They both looked a little sheepish. Prospero replied &quot;We wanted to have a closer look at how certain pieces of machinery operated. Unfortunately they were dirty.&quot;
Paula shook her head in mock exasperation. &quot;Typical boys! Always taking things apart and getting dirty! Did you enjoy yourselves?&quot; I wondered whether Paula's mother carried on like that when her father was working on the car, or doing something in the shed.
&lt;&lt;Like mother like daughter hey sweetheart?&gt;&gt; Nalini thought to me.
&lt;&lt;And like father like son. But I don't think you're like your mother, and I don't think I'm like my father.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, but other people might think differently.&gt;&gt; She blew me a mental kiss, accompanied by a giggle.
Once the two of them cleaned themselves, we started a new game and showed Rupert how to play. Initially we teamed him with Prospero and Liz with Paula, since Liz was only new to the game as well. We swapped around each time we played a new game, ending with Rupert and Liz playing on their own. Nalini and I are telepathic, we have to exercise a little care not to broadcast our strategies to each other when we are playing separately. Everyone seemed to enjoy himself or herself, mahjong is one of those games where you need at least four people. 
That night, Prospero and Paula met up with us in dreaming, as we had arranged earlier. Nalini and I were sitting in the outdoor cafe near the university.
&quot;It is five days by road to your estate, but only one by sea. Tomorrow as you know, we sail with the tide. I would like to show you the road tonight, so you can ride there yourselves if you wish.&quot;
He led the four of us back to the palace grounds. When seen from the perspective of dreaming, everything looked a little eerie. Everything seemed to be lit by a whitish light as from a moon, but every structure seemed to glow with inner light and life. Buildings and trees almost bubbled as if they were effervescent. Nothing external seemed completely real, since we could walk through it. We ourselves seemed to be as we were in waking, quite solid to touch, save that we floated a meter or so above the ground.
We headed down to the town gates, not by walking, but by floating. Select a point ahead, float to it, and then select another point in the distance. We could have walked, but then we would have been limited to a walking speed. By floating we could travel quite easily at the speed of a car, sometimes faster.
From the town gates we followed the road east. The road was made in the style of Roman roads with flagstone paving. It was about two lanes wide, though at this time of night it was empty. The road had been carefully crafted to be higher in the center so that rain would run off into side ditches. Every Aquilonian mile there was a milestone marking the distance from Tarantia.
In the wooded areas, the verge had been cleared of trees and bushes for almost a bowshot. Prospero explained &quot;Under old king Sorono, we had problems with bandits preying on travelers. This was one way to help prevent attacks, but travelers always had to travel in armed bands. One of the first actions Amrik performed as king was to round up most of the bandits. Many of them were resistance fighters, they were offered pardons if they returned to their original occupations. Those who had committed serious crimes were tried and punished, quite a few more tried to fight the king, and perished. Now days the roads are largely clear of bandits throughout the kingdom. That is one of the responsibilities of your estate by the way, you have an area of the country to oversee, and you have to keep it clear of bandits. There will be a county council that handles all of this, but you will be in charge of that. You'll be fully briefed when you arrive.&quot;
&quot;We might leave that till then. I thought from your discussions with Charles and Cromwell that as nobles we have a part to play in the running of the country.&quot;
Our journey wasn't for sight seeing, but to travel the road and note the forks that we had to take. Part way along Nalini and I were struck by the same thought. Prospero had to show us the road because there was no map of the route. &quot;Prospero, have you considered that there should be a road map?&quot;
He chuckled ruefully. &quot;It has crossed my mind, this is one of many things I wish to do.&quot; He swept his hand through his hair. &quot;I have so many irons in the fire I have trouble keeping track of them. One of those irons is to map the country. We lack the technology to produce accurate maps such as you have. There is a crude map of the country, with the major cities indicated, and the roads between them and the distances. Your estate is not on those maps, though the nearby town is.&quot;
&quot;Hey Prospero, I know you've been doing a lot of investigations by yourself, with Paula and Durathror, but why not ask us to help? Between the four of us we should be able to juggle twice as many irons.&quot;
&quot;In the past you have been busy with your own work, and you haven't had the links to Aquilonia that you have now. I would appreciate your help. But in my defense&quot; he held up a hand &quot;at first I only had a few projects, and there wasn't a problem. I was just investigating forms of government, printing, and steam power. But the number has grown. We've been expanding the king's messenger service into the royal mail. It works, but we need post houses every ten miles along the road. A courier can travel up to a hundred or miles in a day. Big deal huh? We need a rapid transport system, I am looking at railways and steam power. We need a rapid communication system. I would prefer to avoid stringing telegraph wires across the country, but to avoid that we need satellites! We need electric power. Then there is mapping the country. We have a royal guild of cartographers, but they are six elderly men, and most of them are more concerned with the artistic illustrations of their maps than with their accuracy. The most accurate maps are those that were produced over five hundred years ago.&quot;
&quot;Well Prospero, why don't we pool our talents and manage them all between us. It will take decades to do all this, possibly centuries for some. We set the direction, get the original stuff set up, and get to a point where locals can take over. You left out education, and do you really want to adopt our culture lock stock and barrel?&quot;
&quot;No, that is the point. Some things I will import, but I want us to be able to develop much of the technology locally. I don't wish to repeat the mistakes of your shadow where the less technologically developed nations were over-run by the others. I'd like to do it right, or at least better.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Even my newspaper is an example. I could become a newspaper baron, but that would entail importing all my technology. I want to develop a local equivalent, while still retaining some of the advantages of the imported technology. I dare say that other presses will set up in competition, but I would not want the infrastructure such as roads and rail to be subject to competition.&quot;
I was nodding. &quot;Yes, you don't need competing railway line sizes like we have back home. You might have competition between rail services, but they would all have to use the same lines. But you know my opinion, public transportation is a service that is difficult to run at a profit, at least if it is government run it can be concerned with meeting timetables and public safety. Those things tend to take a back seat when it's privatized.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;Prospero, my own opinion is that except for stuff for your personal use, you should avoid importing technology. That's exactly what the colonial powers did to the less technologically advanced nations. You should be looking at appropriate technology, and educating people. You people understand about steam power, it is within your society's current abilities, I would work mainly with that. If you are going to use electricity, you really need the background industries to support it, and the education levels. Otherwise it will be the colonies all over again.&quot;
&quot;That's a valid point Nalini, and one I've been thinking of. The newspaper is the first use of imported technology outside my own personal use. It's just that the things the computer allows me to do I can't do any other way.&quot;
&quot;I know. It's there, maybe you could use that as a pilot for the most advanced technology, because you want to disseminate information and news, and you want to be able to print books in your own language to educate people. But for the rest, work out what your people can do now, and build that up slowly. Let them devise and invent, and not become dependent on our own research.&quot;
&quot;A technology pilot is a convenient excuse for what I've done already.&quot; Prospero replied. &quot;And it does serve my purpose to print a newspaper.&quot; He laughed ruefully. &quot;You have crystallized a dilemma I have been facing but haven't fully verbalized. We can't just import your technology, we will be forever dependent on you, we must develop it ourselves, and that will take time. Technology pilots should stimulate us to develop the technology. But at the same time, I want to avoid making the mistakes your people made. It would be good if we could just go for best practice, but there is a host of problems associated with that approach.&quot;
We talked more, and at least resolved that the four of us would take an active role in the management of innovation into Aquilonia. If we retained contact with England, then there would be similar implications there that I did not want to think about.
We followed the road into the mountain range where Aquilonia's water supply came from. The road had been well engineered, and was reasonably straight. It passed through many towns along its way. Most of the forks and crossroads were in towns rather than out in the middle of nowhere. As it reached the foothills, it began to resort to switchbacks to manage the climb. The road angled through a low pass, and then descended via more switchbacks through farmland, across two rivers and into a major city. There we headed off to the right on a second road that wound into some low hills and then descended toward the coast. Eventually it passed into the city of Forgissa. There we took a minor road, no longer paved, that snaked its way into some more hills. 
&quot;Prospero, why isn't this road paved?&quot;
&quot;It isn't a main road. The main road circles those hills and heads for the seaport of Arana. There is a second paved road from there that leads from Arana to Maldana, but it stops there. Bendora is a little out from Maldana. I am taking the shorter route, it saves about one hundred and fifty miles.&quot;
On the far side of those hills we could see the sea in the distance. Prospero commented &quot;The sea port is over there, that is where we will sail to. Maldana is nearer, but off to the left somewhere. The Bendora estate stretches from these low hills all the way down to the sea, and some distance left and right.&quot; He pointed to a hill in the middle distance. &quot;Your manor house is there, it has views to the sea, the hills, and a subterranean stream for water. I would have to look up my records to tell you more about it right now.&quot;
&quot;I thought that Amrik said he had created this estate for us? Did he also build a manor house?&quot;
&quot;Yes and No.&quot; Prospero grinned. &quot;The estate was created from crown land. But the manor house belonged to a noble house that died out three hundred years ago. The crown resumed the estate, and installed managers for the grounds and the farms. Amrik has combined that estate with two others that have been disused for some time, minor houses that angered king Sorono's father, who had the entire family wiped out. Those grounds are disused, their manors in ruins. But one third of your estate is working, and producing income.&quot;
Nalini made a face. &quot;Two ruined manors, and our own has had a hereditary manager for three hundred years. How does the current manager feel about having us come in to curb his freedoms?&quot;
&quot;That's a good question, and not one I can answer right now. The manager would have been answerable to the king, or one of his delegates. But my guess is that pretty much from day to day he would have been able to behave very much as a law unto himself.&quot;
&quot;That's what I feared. Suddenly along we come, curb his freedoms, perhaps find he's been embezzling large sums of money, or at least behaving like a petty noble, and we have some problems.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;One of many things we'll have to look into tomorrow.&quot;
We contented ourselves with a general scouting of the layout, and the lie of the land. We also picked several spots to study the details, with the idea that we could walk through shadow to those points if the need arose. Our dreaming bodies were active in any sifting of shadows, we did not need to be present in our physical bodies. The manor house was a flattened H shape situated on the side of a small hill, with extensive gardens that appeared to be well maintained. Around the hill farmland spread out, dotted here and there with villages. The unpaved road led from the hills to the manor, and then on to Maldana. A second unpaved road led down to the beach, while other smaller tracks lead to various villages.
The two ruined manors had been looted of anything of value, then burned. Trees in the orchards had been cut down, statues, fountains and anything breakable had been smashed. They were sad sites. Both ruins were situated near streams.
Prospero commented &quot;Those streams remind me of another iron I have in the fire. Most of the cities have poor water quality, unless they have aqueducts to bring fresh water from the mountains. The quantity of water that can be brought from the mountains is limited. Tarantia has enough for a much larger population, but most of the cities have a shortage. It is especially a problem in the coastal cities. I would like to build some large dams to store water. But I am also aware that we need to do something about the city sewerage, most of which simply flows directly into the nearest river.&quot;
&quot;It isn't a simple problem, is it?&quot; I commented. &quot;We can't deal with everything, but if it is a problem, we set up a working committee to look into it. Can you still build aqueducts and paved roads? You haven't lost the techniques or the engineers?&quot;
&quot;No, there was a time when that was a danger, but construction and water engineers are plentiful. Cartographers are another story.&quot;
&quot;Well, sewerage treatment should be a priority. I don't know what you do now, but any treatment is better than none.&quot;
&quot;There is no sewerage treatment. Older areas do not have flushing toilets, instead a cart comes around to collect cans of sewerage. Those are emptied into the river as far as I know.&quot;
&quot;Okay, so you need a sewerage treatment works. Not so hard for the cans, except they have to be trucked to the treatment area. I don't know what you do with flushing toilets, you really need pumps to pump the waste through pipes to the treatment plant. Septic tanks might be a partial answer.&quot;
&quot;Is that two or perhaps three different irons to manage?&quot;
&quot;Take your pick. I'd make sewerage treatment one iron, and sources of clean water a second.&quot;
 The next day we were up about sunrise. There was three hours till the ship sailed with the tide, but since Tarantia operated on natural light, everyone was up with the sun. As nobles, we did not have to pack, though Nalini and I packed our own back packs to ensure that nothing was missed. Servants would take our luggage to the docks, all we had to do was be there before the ship sailed.
After breakfast, Prospero took the rest of us in the direction of the docks, but we rode past and on to the naval shipyards. Here there were a number of wooden vessels in various stages of repair, and several on the process of being built. Prospero greeted the guards, and lead us through the yards to a large shed by the water. Beside the shed a large schooner was on blocks and being refitted. The first thing that I noticed was a tall smokestack rising out of the wheelhouse on the aft deck.
Prospero led us on board. &quot;In a standard clipper, the officers' quarters are on the aft deck. A schooner has the officers' quarters forward of here, the steering deck is usually empty, and the area underneath is used for storage. This is a pilot project to install a steam engine in a ship.&quot;
He led us down some stairs in front of the wheelhouse, warning &quot;Mind your heads, there isn't a lot of room down here.&quot;
The area beneath the wheelhouse was lit by several oil lamps. On the left side a copper tank was bolted to the wooden floor, on the right hand side there was a hopper filled with chunks of wood. In the center, two men in grimy clothes were working on a partially dismantled steam engine. At the back there were some large gears connected to two iron rods that disappeared through the floor.
Prospero indicated the rods &quot;These drive the screws at the back. There are some problems with fitting a steam engine to a ship. We had to specially strengthen this area, because of the weight and the driving forces involved. How's it going lads?&quot; he directed his enquiry to the two men.
One was a blond haired man in his early thirties, the other a grizzled bear of a man in his late fifties. Prospero was probably younger than both of them. The elder ran his hands through his hair. &quot;Well your lordship, the salt water causes considerable corrosion and deposits salts inside the boiler. The salt deposits we can handle, the twin boiler arrangement means that one can be cleaned while the other is used. What ever alloy is used in your smaller engine we cannot duplicate. Yours does not corrode. She'll sail but you'll need to refit the boilers regularly, and that'll not be cheap. Other than that, we need better ventilation when the boilers on, it grows uncomfortably hot at times.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;We'll use this ship to test how a steam ship should be designed, the next one will be built for the engine. Oh, this is baron Laredo and his son Marko. The baron is the head of the engineer's guild.&quot; He introduced the rest of us. &quot;We must find out how to duplicate the allow that is used.&quot;
&quot;What is the other engine you are talking about?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Oh, I brought a small steam engine from your world, and fitted it to a small fishing smack. It's range is somewhat limited by the need to carry fuel, but we use seawater in the boiler. It works, it does not corrode, though as Laredo said, we do get salt deposits. Rupert, you won't believe this, it will sail at a steady twenty four miles per hour. I've no doubt that with a bigger engine it could sail perhaps twice as fast.&quot;
Rupert whistled. &quot;We have experimented with steam ships, but the best we have been able to manage is about nine knots, I think that is ten miles per hour. Faster than the average sailing ship, but not by much. On rivers they can use fresh water, which doesn't cause too much of a corrosion problem, but salt water probably does corrode the iron boilers.&quot;
Something was working in the back of my mind. &quot;Iron does corrode. I think you need to make the boilers from stainless steel.&quot;
There were blank looks from the Aquilonians and prince Rupert. Prospero asked in English &quot;I know there is difference between iron and steel, but I'm not sure what that is. I know your kitchen sink is stainless steel, my boiler looks the same. What is it?&quot;
&quot;Okay, we might need to do some research to answer that fully. Steel is highly pure iron that has carbon in it to make it stronger. You need a blast furnace, a Bessemer converter, which blows air through the furnace so that all the impurities burn off. You need a small percentage of carbon to make the metal stronger. A steel sword is strong enough to shatter an iron one.&quot;
Prospero interrupted. &quot;I received a very odd mental picture with that word Bessemer converter. I don't think we have anything like it here, I'll have to investigate it when I return to your shadow.&quot;
Laredo shook his head. &quot;It is odd talking with you sorcerers, some of what you say is pictures in my head. I think I know what you mean. Iron must be heated to yellow heat, packed in charcoal and have air blown through it to make steel for a sword. But if what I saw is correct, you would heat it till it runs like water, and blow air through that. I doubt that stone would withstand such heat.&quot;
&quot;There's a chalky stone called dolomite that is used to line the furnace. But we are running beyond my knowledge. Stainless steel is special steel which has had um...&quot; I paused to think &quot;chromium and vanadium added, I think. Prospero, we'll chase that up when we get back to earth. It doesn't corrode. A question, why use iron for the boiler, and not copper?&quot;
Laredo smiled &quot;Iron is stronger, it withstands the pressure better. Copper would split.&quot;
&quot;Okay, a suggestion for you to try. Take your iron boiler and pipes, and coat them inside with copper. If the coating is complete, the copper will protect the iron from corroding. Another suggestion is to coat the inside with zinc. It will corrode even faster than iron, but while there is some zinc in the seawater, the iron will be protected. You would need to recoat the boiler regularly if you use zinc.&quot;
Laredo looked at his son. Marko replied &quot;We should be able to make a copper boiler that fits inside the iron one. The pipes would be a challenge though.&quot;
Laredo then added &quot;Then the iron supplies the strength, the copper inside protects. That might just work. I'll put people on that today.&quot; He scratched his head. &quot;What was that you said about zinc?&quot;
&quot;Oh, I think it's called sacrificial protection. If you have two metals in close contact, like bolted together or melted on, then the one that corrodes more easily will corrode first. If you keep replacing the first metal before it corrodes away, the second is protected. I'd need to look that up, that's all I know.&quot;
Laredo nodded. &quot;I will see Darko today, he is the chief metallurgist. Perhaps he will know something about this, and perhaps he can experiment with the making of stainless steel. You sorcerers have brought exciting times for us with all this new engineering information.&quot;
I nodded and replied &quot;We have information that you don't, but we don't have all the answers. Our engineering is just where yours would be in say another three hundred years without our help.&quot;
We took out leave, and Prospero led us into the shed. Here there were assorted parts from several steam engines, and chocked on wooden blocks was a small boat perhaps twenty five feet long. Bolted to the back of the boat was a small steam engine driving two brass propellers. &quot;This is the first steam powered ship in all of Aquilonia!&quot; Prospero announced proudly.
Rupert looked in puzzlement. &quot;Where is the paddle wheel? How is it pushed along?&quot;
Prospero pointed to the brass propellers. &quot;These do the work. They are far more efficient than a paddle wheel. We could never reach such high speeds otherwise.&quot;
Rupert shook his head. &quot;I would never have believed it. You have solved a problem that has bothers us with steam ships. If Danny solves the boiler problem as well, then an age of a steam navy will descend on England. I know we must catch the tide soon, but later I would like complete information about how that propeller works.&quot;
Prospero laughed. &quot;I have the very thing.&quot; He walked over to a cupboard, and took out a toy boat. &quot;This I bought in Danny's world. It is a child's toy, but it uses a small steam engine to power these two propellers here. We'll take it with us. I used this as the idea behind my first steam powered boat.&quot; He indicated the boat on blocks. &quot;The two propellers on this boat were also brought from Danny's world, but those on the boat outside we manufactured here. The entire steam engine is Aquilonian.&quot;
I nodded. &quot;I gathered it was local manufacture, that's why it's iron and not stainless steel. That's what you should be doing, developing local technology when ever you can, and not relying on imported goods.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;Electronic goods are another matter, but steam power and metallurgy is something we have the basis for, and can build on.&quot;
We left then, and headed back to the docks to board our ship for the journey to Bendora estate.

            <Text>Chapter 8
The ship was three masted, but not square rigged, the sails pointed fore and aft like those of a typical yacht. This meant the boat could be sailed much closer to the wind than a typical square-rigger, and could make better speed in most situations. The sea journey took about twenty hours, which meant we averaged just over ten Aquilonian miles per hour. I cannot be more precise, the Aquilonians do not know the distance accurately. By road the journey to the port of Arana has been measured and is known to be about two hundred and forty five Aquilonian miles. The sea journey is possibly a little shorter, but lacking satellite tracking and global positioning, no one really knows. It is known to be about a day's sailing, that is enough for the average Aquilonian.
On board ship, there is not a lot to do as a passenger, except watch the shoreline go past slowly, talk, eat, or sleep. Our dog spent the first few hours of the voyage wandering around the ship, stopping every few meters to look over the side at the water, then moving on to see if the view was any different. After a time, she curled up in the shade near us, and went to sleep.
Rupert was no sailor, but he was knowledgeable enough to know that ships of his world were square rigged. He and Prospero discussed the relative merits of the square rigging versus schooner rigging, a discussion we listened to but did not contribute much. According to Prospero, square rigging had been used briefly in the past, but they had found schooner rigging to be both faster in most winds and better able to sail into the wind, and now square rigging was very much obsolete.
Passenger cabins were toward the stern of the ship. The cabins were small but adequate. The bed was really only big enough for one person, of two friendly people. There was a small table with a single bench style seat against the wall. Our packs could be stowed underneath the bed, there was a small closet for hanging clothes, but there was little other luggage space.
There were four toilet cubicles in the stern of the ship for use by officers and passengers, they were on the seaward side of the bathing room. The bathing room itself was communal, with three large tubs that could be filled, along with several dozen buckets that could be used for personal ablutions. There were gratings that drained out into the sea, I could imagine the floor being awash with seawater in rough weather.
There was a small dining room where the passengers and officers ate together. The food was fairly plain, but there was copious alcohol. Nalini and I stuck with the bread and cheese, plus fruit, there wasn't any other vegetarian fare.
This was a passenger ship intended to carry nobles, I shuddered to think what an ordinary ship might be like. Nalini and I supposed the floating palaces of our day would have to wait until the steam powered liner was invented, and wooden hulls gave way to steel.
We spent most of the daylight hours on deck, the weather was fair, and the deck was roomier than our cabin. A coastal cruise sounds romantic, but the realities were something of a disappointment.
As night fell, we sailed on, and I was relieved to see lighthouses stationed along the coast. I know cruise ships back home sail through the night, but they have navigation instruments, while this ship had little more than a compass and some coastal charts.
There was also a common room where the passengers could congregate if they wished. All of us gravitated there after dinner. Prospero and Rupert fell to talking about steam power and its applications, and they talked for hours. The four of us began playing mahjong, much to the interest of several other passengers. There could be a market for mahjong sets, provided we could arrange for the instructions to be translated into Aquilonian.
Without coffee we tired earlier than usual, though the sea air may have had something to do with that. Aquilonians in general are early risers and early retirers, no doubt partly due to the absence of electric light. Candlelight and oil-light tend to promote sleepiness. Nalini and I snuggled up and slept soundly and well, despite the hardness and narrowness of our bed. Nalini believes that maybe it was because of it.
Not long after dawn the ship began making its way into the harbor at Arana. Part of the port was still in shadow, but the higher buildings and those on the hill gleamed whitely in the early morning sun. There were a number of tall masted sailing ships tied up at the docks, while several more sailed toward the docks.
We furled the sails and dropped anchor before we reached the docks. Rowboats took ropes from the ship to the docks, and then the ship was laboriously hauled against the docks by a team of men. The process took a while, but with only sails for motive power, and without tugboats this was probably the only way to bring the ship into her birth.
Finally the ship was secured to the wharf, and the gangplank let down. Prospero pointed out a reception committee waiting for us. I groaned inwardly. &quot;I guess this means I have to give a speech?&quot;
&quot;Yes, and you will have to spend time being polite to people you don't know.&quot; He chuckled in reply. &quot;That will be the mayor, and the others will be the leading dignitaries from the city. You will be the king's representative for the region, as of now, you are their boss, and they are your delegates for the king's authority. Collectively you will be responsible for the good order of the region.&quot;
&quot;I am still not clear what my responsibilities are. You haven't briefed us yet.&quot;
&quot;No, but I'm planning to spend the next few days with you to brief you and show you how I would do things. Essentially you are the chief administrator, similar to the mayor of the city, except that your responsibilities are the entire region. You will need to arrange briefing meetings with the each of the town councils while you are here. But as I see it, you are the person who ensures that the roads are maintained, the laws obeyed, new laws made known, taxes collected and sent to the king's treasury. You are the final appeal for decisions, excepting the king himself. You will set directions, make decisions that your underlings cannot, but otherwise you leave the day to day running of the region to your underlings. You aren't a lawyer and you aren't a judge, but a judge may refer matters to you for advice. This area has been largely running itself for some time now, so unless there are problems that we don't know about, you can leave the councils to run things.&quot;
&quot;So who looked after this region before?&quot;
&quot;Technically it was Amrik, but in practice it was a committee of the mayors, who act as your advisors. I would leave the committee as it stands, but you take the head position. You also have a duty to attend the parliament or send a deputy. Not everyone does of course.&quot;
The mayor was a rather portly man with a florid face and a tendency to sweat. Prospero introduced Nalini and me, whereupon the mayor welcomed us fulsomely, and ushered us into waiting carriages. I think he wanted to sit in the carriage with Nalini and me except that Prospero got in and with Paula took up the available seats. The mayor was relegated to the carriage with Rupert and Liz.
There were crowds of people thronging the streets to watch us drive past, and more people in the city square where we alighted. A stand had been set up on one side, with shade and chairs. City dignitaries occupied the back rows. Prospero, Paula, Rupert and Liz were shown to front row seats on one side, while Nalini and I were shown to front row seats on the other side. The mayor stood at the podium and gave a welcoming speech.
It would be my turn soon. I wondered just how far the translation spell would carry. Nalini linked with me, and we did out best to bolster the power of the spell so that the assembled crowd would be able to understand me.
The mayor walked a fine line between being happy we were here and being unhappy about it. The gist of his speech was something along the lines that it had been an honor to be looked after directly by the king, but the king was a busy man. Now the region had its own noble house, and could stand with pride amongst the other regions. The region had many longstanding traditions, which they all hoped would continue to be upheld by their new lord. They felt it a unique honor that the king had chosen one of his favorites to be their lord. He finished off by welcoming us again then called on duke Prospero to introduce us.
Prospero stood and gave a simple speech. He told how we had saved both the king's and his own life, and had been instrumental in defeating the followers of the evil serpent god. We had been granted the Bendora estates as our fief in token gratitude. He went on briefly about how we were working directly with himself and Amrik to bring in the parliament of the people to ensure that the government was responsive to the people's needs. Finally he introduced us, and then called on me to give a speech.
I thanked them for their welcome. I went on to say that I was looking forward to working with the city mayors in the administration of the region. I stated that although new administrations often took a broom and swept away the trappings of the old regime, I did not intend to do so unless there was good reason, and then only after I had discussed it with the mayors. I also said that I would be looking for ways to make the region a jewel in the crown of Aquilonia, and that since I had the king's ear, I intended to use that to the region's advantage. Then I went on to talk briefly about parliamentary government, and how it could not work unless the people made it work. I spoke briefly about how the new government was based on the concept that all citizens had equal rites before the law, and that the rich had a duty of care towards those less fortunate than themselves, that the strong must defend the weak, and not prey upon them. I finished with a variation on Kennedy's famous words: &quot;A great ruler once said &quot;Do not ask what your country can do for you, rather ask what you can do for your country.&quot; If all of us think like that then Aquilonia will be a fair and just place to live. I would like our region to set an example to the rest of Aquilonia. Thank you, it is an honor to be here.&quot;
The mayor took the podium again, and thanked us once more. Then he reminded everyone that there was to be a reception and dance in our honor that Saturday in the town hall, and that the formalities were over.
We were then requested to get back in our carriages, and were conveyed to someone's mansion, possibly the mayor's, possibly one of the leading merchants'. There we were offered refreshments in the ornate floral garden, and given a chance to meet the city elders and the city judges along with the commander of the garrison. Each of the larger cities in the region had their own company of the king's legionnaires, of which I was now the region commander, a brevet general to coin a rank.
Prospero stuck with me, while Paula stuck with Nalini. I kept in mental contact with Nalini, but since we were kept busy meeting people we had little time for private conversations.
It seemed to Nalini and I that if we took this position seriously, there would be quite a lot of work for both of us. We could see the wisdom in Prospero's edict about letting the underlings run their own little areas, and simply coordinating and setting policy directions. The underlings would no doubt prefer it that way too.
Prospero made a point of ensuring I was introduced to everyone, I let each one know that if there were any problems with the way the region was being administered, my door would be open. I avoided committing myself on any issue either. A number of people sought my thoughts on particular issues of interest to themselves, I told each of them that once I was briefed on the facts of the issue I would form an opinion.
I also asked people how the region was currently being run. I soon found out that each of the major cities had their mayor and their council of elders who met to met to administer the city, and nothing else. The mayor was concerned about my plans for administering the region.
I replied &quot;I will be feeling my way for a while. What I have in mind is regular meetings between the mayors of all the cities and myself where we can air issues that are bigger than a single city. I will offer advice on issues within a city, so maybe I should attend your council meetings from time to time. However, I intend to let the city councils continue to run the cities as they have, provided of course that I don't find evidence that there is corruption and bribery happening.&quot;
It was a relief when we finally got away. Our party had swelled, we were accompanied by twelve soldiers mounted on horseback. We rode our own horses which had come over on the ship, As we rode toward the garrison town of Maldana Prospero remarked &quot;I'm impressed Danny! You handled yourself remarkably well. You avoided committing to any course of action before you have been briefed, you let them think that their cozy little arrangements will be left alone, yet you said the right things about policy directions, coordinating the administration and you dropped a hint about corruption.&quot;
&quot;Time spent watching all those politicians on TV was obviously well spent! I was trying to avoid saying anything that could be used against me later. I'd prefer to find out who does what before I make enemies. But I did feel a bit out of my depth.&quot;
Prospero smiled. &quot;So now you know how I felt when first I came to your shadow earth. You seem to have found your feet though.&quot;
&quot;Is it just my job, or can Nalini share the load?&quot;
&quot;Well, traditionally it is the head of the noble house, but I see no reason why you and Nalini cannot share the work between yourselves.&quot;
&quot;Good, we'll share the workload.&quot;
&quot;But don't make it too hard on yourselves, leave the day to day running to the town councils.&quot;
&quot;Oh I intend to, otherwise this could be a full time job acting as administrator for the region. I want things to run smoothly without having to spend all my time turning the wheels. I think I'll concentrate on areas that aren't working as well as they should.&quot;
&quot;On a more serious note, I am sure you will find evidence of crime and corruption. Many officials will have taken advantage of no overlord to feather their own nests. This region pays less tax than we think it should, but you cannot just rush in and change things. As you know, you have to find out first, and gain people's trust.&quot;
&quot;What do we do if we find corruption? Chances are the local judge might be in on it.&quot;
Prospero nodded &quot;Good point. If you find evidence, you'd best let Amrik or myself know, and then we'll take it from there. We'd have to have them up before one of the leading judges. Once that happens, you could find that everyone here becomes your enemy, even the garrison commanders. I would advise do nothing hasty, you want these people on your side if possible.&quot;
I nodded. &quot;I prefer to take time to decide what is the correct thing to do, and to give people time to save face. Most matters aren't life and death anyway.&quot;
&quot;Saving face is important. You may find that if you put someone on notice to mend their ways, with a threat of the king's justice, and allow them to save face, they might do what is needed. But you would need to introduce all those checks and balances you are so fond of to ensure they don't return to their old ways.&quot;
&quot;Can a leopard change its spots? Can corrupt officials really mend their ways? We really need to send them for re-education, but we don't have anything prepared. It's king Charles and the Puritans again. They have attitudes that are inappropriate for the society, they need to have those attitudes changed.&quot;
&quot;Doesn't the term re-education have distasteful undertones in English?&quot;
&quot;Yes, it's been used by totalitarian governments across the world as a euphemism for locking people up, treating them badly, and brainwashing them into supporting the regime. I'd rather we did things slowly, so that people are willing to follow where we lead.&quot;
Prospero was nodding. &quot;We are the leaders of Aquilonian society, we have to lead by example. There is always a broad range of attitudes out there. But you people have introduced a host of new ideas that we all have to come to terms with. We are all in need of re-education.&quot;
&quot;Re-education only works to a certain extent. In fact, I read somewhere that the experts think it takes three generations for so called re-education to have an effect on the bulk of the population. They get to where the opinion makers are now, so of course the opinion makers have moved on over those three generations. It can't be done to fast, and the leaders can't move to far ahead, because that's when society starts to fragment and fall apart.&quot;
Prospero was thoughtful. &quot;Do you know Danny, it's statements like that which prove to me that you and Nalini are well suited for this. Your education system has taught you many things that we are still working out. Paula often amazes me at her depth of understanding of the consequences of actions, and how people will react, yet she does not consider herself to be well educated by your world's standards. You may take it for granted that everyone knows something, but often that is not the case. Schooling is not compulsory here. Many people cannot read or write, and many who can have only two years schooling. Artisans learn by being apprenticed to other artisans. Merchants and nobles may have four or five years schooling only, unless they train for one of the professions. I have only seven years schooling. I wanted to train for engineering, my father wanted me to learn how to manage the estate.&quot;
&quot;I guess that once your brother died, you became the old duke's heir, so he wanted you to learn what you needed for that.&quot;
&quot;True, but I am learning much more now from your world, with Paula's help. For example, take accounting. We keep records, we employ scribes whose job it is to write down records of what happens, money we receive, money we spend. But at best that is like a day journal. Paula has taught me what she knows about accounting and bookkeeping. It is so simple, yet it is such a revolutionary concept. I want to introduce basic accounting as something for all financial records. We have trained a few of our scribes, and we have set up a simple accounting system using several books.&quot;
&quot;Hey, that's great. I will look at doing the same with our estate. Are you planning to computerize at a later date?&quot;
&quot;I know computers would make it quicker, Paula could keep all the records herself, but I have seven scribes I pay to keep records, I am not about to sack them. They are all learning basic accounting. I might use them to train others in the public service. One of my projects is to take an accounting textbook, translate it into Aquilonian and print it for those who want to read it.&quot;
&quot;Prospero, I think you need about another fifty of you just to keep up with all your projects. How do you find time to visit us?&quot;
&quot;I apply the same techniques my father taught me to use to manage the estate. I think you call it delegation. I investigate, get a project started, put some good people on it and let them go. Then I monitor their progress, provide guidance, but otherwise I let someone else do the work. I am a facilitator, coordinator and administrator. And that my friend is something you still need to learn. I know you do most of the things in your work yourself.&quot;
&quot;That's because I don't have a hoard of underlings to do the work, plus most of what I do I enjoy the doing of. But I started the billing and bookkeeping service, Paula was hired to take up much of the workload, and so was Liz. I don't do any of that now, and the business has grown to the point where there are a couple of temps three days a week. If you'd stick around long enough, I'd get you to try your hand at things.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I would like to learn about programming, and web pages and all that, but my English isn't good enough yet. I have learned to process words, and now Paula and I have set up a computer with an Aquilonian font I can do some things on a word processor. I will be teaching the scribes how to do that, then they can do some of their important work on the computer. But my secret is that my estate has a manager who runs it, and each of the towns in my region have their own council who look after that town.&quot;
&quot;Does a town also look after the villages around it, or just the town itself?&quot;
&quot;I think in most cases, a town will only look after itself. You need to see that things needing to be done in villages or in between towns are done. You know, road maintenance and the like. The troops have the responsibility to catch highway robbers, but you would often need to give the commander directions.&quot; He smiled deprecatingly &quot;We need a police force, we have the king's soldiers. I am aware of the difference in training, and one day we will set up a police force. Another iron in the fire.&quot;
&quot;I think we need to find out who manages what, and draw up some sort of map so that the entire region is looked after, not just the towns. For example, a town council should be responsible for the roads around it, and the villages. I think I want a shire or regional council made up of representatives from the town councils. The soldiers can be for catching criminals and other tasks like that, but they aren't trained for detective work. I will look at setting up a special investigative group for solving crimes. We also need community based policing, but I think we can start with citizens as volunteers for a few hours per week. We'll see, Prospero. I want to listen to what the councils tell me, I want to start with their biggest problems, and work down. I need to set up some structure that ensures the whole region is covered.&quot;
We reached Maldana in time for a late lunch. As I've written before, the town is a garrison town, the main army base for the region is situated near by. Each town has its own company of soldiers whose usual duty is to help keep the peace, but the main body resides at Maldana. When I asked Prospero why the troops were here rather than the port which was the region's biggest town, he replied that it was either because the town is fairly central to the region, or because the Bendora estates are nearby and in the past the local noble would have maintained his own army.
The town itself is smaller than Arana, but they had made a point of prettying it up, with window boxes of flowers in many apartment windows, and a broad tree lined avenue that led to the city square which in turn was decorated by tubs of flowers. Being a garrison town, there are many establishments whose business is separating the soldiers from their cash, and the town itself has more of a brash, lively air to it.
Again the town council greeted us, there were speeches and afterwards a meal. The mayor was a tall white haired man with sword calluses on his hand. He seemed genuinely happy to see us, and respectful in a military manner. The council was polite, and questioning to determine what our arrival would mean for the town, but the general populace seemed more friendly and cheered more loudly than they had at Arana.
I asked the young soldiers about it later. One of them responded shyly &quot;Well sir, lot of folks here are connected with the army in one way or another. You're our regional commander, this is your town. Arana's got its port, it doesn't care about us soldiers, and its town council doesn't care for anywhere outside the town. But here in Maldana folks are happy their lord has finally come home.&quot;
&quot;An' sir&quot; another one added &quot;We all heard how you saved king Amrik's life. You're a real soldier, not just a chair warmer. Er.. beggin' your pardon sir.&quot;
&quot;That's all right soldier, I asked for your comments, you're free to give them in your own words.&quot;
I arranged for the mayor and the council to meet with me the next morning for a briefing session. Prospero suggested that they come to the manor, everyone agreed. I met with the real regimental commander, a solid man in his late forties, his hair shot with gray, who asked me if I wanted to inspect the troops. I agreed, on proviso that he provide me with a separate briefing from the one the council would give. He was on the town council, and would be present at the briefing tomorrow, but I wanted a separate briefing from him.
&quot;Certainly sir&quot; he agreed. &quot;There are some matters that are of a military nature that might be best discussed away from the council.&quot;
&quot;That's what I had in mind. I want to find out what the community leaders think are the problems they face, what they would like to see happen. The army base is a separate community, it should be treated as such. But I also need to know who is responsible for what in the region. I would like the entire region to run smoothly.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;How many of the council are retired soldiers, and of those, how many are from outside the region?&quot;
&quot;Five are retired soldiers, plus myself. None of us are from the region originally, though we have all been here for years. The mayor was the regimental commander before me.&quot;
&quot;Good, I believe the old soldiers will be less parochial than the locals. We had a distinct impression that the Arana town council would have preferred that Earl Danny not have been appointed.&quot;
The commander nodded. &quot;That could easily be so. There are suggestions that many in Arana grow fat on bribes, and that much of the king's taxes sticks to their palms. We've always been the poor cousin to the other towns, but we pride ourselves on being honest and loyal to the king. Many residents here are soldiers and their families, or retired soldiers, they are mostly more patriotic than the civilians.&quot;
&quot;Corruption is a serious issue, one we will be looking into. Initially I will be leaving things as they are, but as we find things out, changes will be made.&quot;
 Eventually we got away, and headed for the manor. The commander assigned a squad on horseback to escort us, and let our previous escort return to their accommodation in Arana. We were all on horseback, we made good time over the five miles that separated Maldana from the manor, and arrived there in the mid afternoon.
The road from Maldana to Bendora manor is not paved. We made our way through one village halfway between Maldana and Bendora, but did not stop there. Some people pointed, others stood and watched us ride past, while two small children waved. Once past the village the farmland ended, and the forest took over. We forded a stream, then the road climbed toward the manor.
There were more formalities here, but fortunately these were brief. The guards saluted us as we passed through the main gates. There were extensive grounds, the area between the main gate and the manor was given over to ornamental gardens with manicured trees, flower beds and colorful shrubs. When the drive reached the manor house it circled a large fountain in the bottom half of the H. The house itself was brick that had been cement rendered and then whitewashed. The roof was of bright red terracotta tiles. There was no guttering. The casement windows were made of small diamond panes, and the frames themselves had been painted black. There were rosebushes growing in beds around the house walls, some true bushes, others the climbing variety, trained on trellises attached to the walls. It was spring, the roses were in flower, and the whole area was a riot of red blooms and heady with their perfume.
We had a welcoming committee. It seemed that all the servants and staff at the manor were standing outside in a long line to greet us. Two men stood in front of the line, both in their forties. One was slim, clean-shaven but with long dark hair shot through with gray, the other was muscular, with hair and beard cropped short. The first had that air of a butler, looking on all and sundry with a tinge of condescension and amusement, but always impeccably polite. The second looked more like a retired soldier.
We reined in close to the two men. Grooms rushed over to take the reins and hold the horses for us to dismount. The long haired man bowed low, and announced &quot;My noble lords and ladies, I am Wilomo, the major domo of the house. On behalf of all the staff, I bid you welcome to Bendora estate. May I enquire which of you gentlemen is Earl Daniel?&quot; He managed to sound obsequious, bored and condescending at the same time.
We were about to dismount, but I inclined my head. &quot;I am Earl Daniel. This is my wife the lady Nalini, this gentleman here is duke Prospero, with him is his fianc_e lady Paula, here we have lady Elizabeth, cousin to Lady Nalini, and last but by no means least we have Prince Rupert of the Rhine.&quot;
We dismounted and gave our horses into the care of the waiting grooms. &quot;May we enquire who this gentleman is?&quot; I indicated the bearded man beside him.
&quot;He is no gentleman sir&quot; the bearded man glared at him &quot;he is but the former manager of these estates come to pay his respects and hand over his records.&quot; Wilomo's face said it would be good riddance too.
&quot;I see. Would you describe yourself as a gentleman?&quot;
I think he could see where I was leading. &quot;I.. er.. that is to say, I am the major domo, I er.. am normally accorded the epithet of gentleman.&quot;
&quot;Then perhaps we can also be polite to your companion and accord him the epithet of gentleman as well?&quot; The bearded man smiled at this, though he still looked a little grim.
Wilomo was discomforted, but tried not to let that show. &quot;Certainly sir, I was not intending my words to be impolite, but merely taking the correct usage of the word gentleman, under which nobles are gentlemen and gentlewomen, while the rest of us are not.&quot;
I smiled back. &quot;Correct usage of words is important, I agree, but we must exercise care that when we use words correctly we do not offend others. I know you intended no offense, and I am sure none was taken. Now, could you please introduce me to your companion?&quot;
&quot;Certainly sir&quot; his composure was back. &quot;This is Maraldo, the former manager of the estates. With your permission, he will present his records and keys to you this afternoon.&quot;
&quot;Thank you.&quot; I turned to the bearded man. &quot;Maraldo, why are you the former manager? Should I not be talking with the current manager?&quot;
Wilomo replied &quot;Sir, Maraldo was managing the estate until your appointment. Now he is not needed.&quot;
I sighed and looked exasperated, biting back a sarcastic remark. I managed to be polite. &quot;Thank you Wilomo, but I was asking Maraldo.&quot; I turned back to Maraldo. &quot;I will talk with you in detail later, after we have freshened ourselves. But I'd like to know why you are the former manager.&quot;
&quot;Well sir, now that you've been appointed, you won't be needing me anymore. But after I present my records, I would appreciate if we could discuss my entitlements.&quot;
&quot;Who says I won't be needing you? I will be spending a lot of time away from here, I think I need a manager.&quot; I spread my hands. &quot;I don't know anything about you or any of the staff, I have no idea whether you are a good manager or a bad one.&quot; I turned to include the major domo. &quot;Okay, let me make this clear. I don't want any staff sacked without my prior approval. For now, I will take you all on trust, assuming that you are all good and honest workers. Everyone who was employed before I arrived should still be employed, unless there are good reasons why they should not be re-hired. I mean reasons like complete incompetence, gross misconduct. So Maraldo, would you like to retain your job as estate manager?&quot;
His eyes widened in surprise. &quot;Yes sir, I would.&quot;
&quot;And you're neither incompetent nor guilty of gross misconduct?&quot;
&quot;Certainly not sir! I am an honest man, I used to be a centurion, and quarter master until I retired from the army to take up this position.&quot;
&quot;Good. Well Wilomo, can you see any reason for not rehiring Maraldo?&quot;
&quot;Er.. no sir. He was a good manager of the estate.&quot;
&quot;Then you're rehired as estate manager Maraldo. For now, your employment conditions are the same as before. Does that cause any problems to either of you?&quot;
&quot;Well sir&quot; Wilomo began &quot;There is the minor detail of the cottage&quot;
&quot;All right, how about we discuss the details after we get through the formalities? Who was responsible for hiring and firing and setting employment conditions?&quot;
The two looked at one another. &quot;Well sir, we both were...&quot; Wilomo began.
Maraldo continued &quot;We made all the hiring and firing decisions jointly.&quot;
&quot;And so you set your own conditions as well?&quot;
They nodded &quot;Yes sir.&quot;
&quot;Okay, we'll discuss all that later, somewhere more private. You two are happy to work together?&quot;
They looked at one another and nodded again. &quot;Yes sir.&quot;
&quot;Okay, let's go meet the staff. Later I want to talk with each of you separately, and maybe some of the other senior staff. I want to find out who is responsible for what, so I know who I should talk to if I want something done.&quot;
&quot;Sir, normally you would speak with me regarding any domestic matters, and Maraldo regarding other matters. But mention anything to either of us, we will inform the other if it is something he should know about.&quot;
&quot;All right, for starters, we all need accommodation. Duke Prospero and his lady require a suite, Prince Rupert and his lady require a suite. Secondly, tomorrow morning, the councilors from Maldana are dropping in to brief me on things in their town. We need to make appropriate arrangements, they'll need lunch, we need to locate a room where we can all meet, we need a scribe for taking notes, all that sort of stuff. Thirdly, over the next few days we expect a number of visitors to drop in from Tarantia, I'm not sure how many, perhaps as many as twelve, and I'm not sure when. We need to make sure we can put them up and feed them. Fourthly, I want to arrange for the councilors from each town in the region to come here and brief me on affairs in their town. I want each council to arrive on different days, again we will need to make appropriate arrangements for their visits. Apart from that, we'd all like to freshen up, we've had a long day.&quot;
&lt;&lt;I think we need a personal assistant to organize our days.&gt;&gt; I thought to Nalini.
&lt;&lt;If we haven't got one, we can hire one. But they may be hard to find out here.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;That's what I thought. What do you make of these two?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;There's something they're not telling us. I think something has spoiled their friendship.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Then we'll have to dig into it and sort it out.&gt;&gt;
Wilomo was suddenly professional. &quot;Certainly sir, I will see to that as soon as the formalities are done.&quot;.
&quot;And I will see to my part.&quot; Maraldo added.
We finally went to meet the staff, drawn up in their line. There was some sort of hierarchy, we started with the head chef and the head gardener, worked our way down to scribes, chamber maids and finally scullery maids, grooms, groundsmen and the like.
Then it was speech time again. I kept it short. I thanked them all for greeting me then said something like &quot;You may be looking nervously at me, wondering what I will be like, but here I am in my first day on the job, also feeling nervous. I would like us all to get to know each other better, I would like us all to be one big happy family. Let me reassure all of you that there will be no sackings. But also, if you have problems that you feel I could help you solve, or you are unhappy with conditions here for any reason, my door will be open. I want all of you to feel free to discuss any problems with me. Don't assume that I won't be interested. Any problem that makes you unhappy or affects you work affects all of us. If my wife or I can help in some way, we will be happy to. We welcome the chance to get to know you all.&quot;
 The estate had no running water, and hot water for bathing had to be hauled from the stream and then heated. That water was being heated, but it would be some time before we could bathe. The head housekeeper apologized profusely to us, explaining that we hadn't been expected until evening. We let Rupert and Liz have what hot water there was, and Nalini and I wound up talking with senior staff while waiting. Prospero and Paula joined us, mainly because they could offer us advice.
First up was the senior chef. He was solid looking man in his early thirties, with a waxed moustache and little goatee. It transpired that like most of the staff, he had commenced work here only two months ago. Before that he had been just one of a number of chefs at the palace.
&quot;It may be a bit early for you to say how you enjoy working for us, but I would like your opinion of your kitchens, the dining areas, your staff. What's wrong, what's good, what could be improved.&quot;
He was sitting in our study, looking a little uncomfortable, and nursing a glass of wine. &quot;Well your lordships, your ladyships&quot; he began diffidently. &quot;Er.. the staff all seem good and hardworking. I must confess there had been little to do in the way of cooking over the past two months other than prepare food for the staff.&quot;
&quot;Please, just call me sir if you want to be deferential. I find being called 'Your Lordship' puts too much distance between us.&quot;
&quot;Yes your ... er ... yes sir.&quot;
&quot;So there has been nothing to challenge your culinary skills yet. Now, if we were to ask you to exercise your skills, is the kitchen up to it, or does it need improving? Can you get all the ingredients you need?&quot;
&quot;Well sir, to be honest, not all the ingredients we need can be obtained locally. I have had long talks with the head gardener, and we have set up a herb garden and vegetable garden that will enable us to grow almost everything here, but unfortunately most plants cannot be harvested yet.&quot;
I nodded. &quot;That is commendable. I have grown vegetables myself, I know they take time. Can you write?&quot;
He looked surprised, but nodded. &quot;Yes sir, a senior chef must know how to write.&quot;
&quot;My apologies, I am ignorant sometimes. Could you give us a list of things that cannot be obtained locally, I have in mind arranging to buy them in Tarantia.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;Normally you would have this arranged through the major domo, but as a gourmet myself, I would like to ensure that your master chef has the ingredients he needs. I believe I know the best places to obtain many ingredients, and master Vivaldo you may know better places than I do for some ingredients. So please include where you would recommend we obtain the ingredients, and what quantity to buy.&quot; Then he smiled at me. &quot;Sorry Danny, this is your show, I'm just offering advice.&quot;
&quot;That's fine, things are a little different here from what we're used to. What about the kitchens master Vivaldo? Are they up to the standard you would like?&quot;
&quot;They are sir. Duke Prospero himself arranged my hiring, and we discussed then that the kitchens should be renovated. I was given a free hand in remodeling the kitchens and I spent the first month here organizing that. Your kitchens are the equal of any in Tarantia, it is a joy to work there.&quot;
&quot;Good. Thank you Prospero, You should have said you hired the staff.&quot;
&quot;Oh, but I didn't hire any except the head chef. I instructed Maraldo and Wilomo that they should hire staff for the estate. I'm a gourmet, remember? I thought a top class chef and decent kitchens were a must. The kitchens even have running water, though it must be hauled in buckets to the tank. I would like to arrange a steam or electric pump and install decent plumbing, but now you are the master of the estate, it will be your decision.&quot;
I chuckled &quot;I think I need to know what income this estate produces so I know what we can afford. But plumbing I would place high on the list of must haves.&quot; I turned back to my chef. &quot;Well master Vivaldo, I won't keep you much longer. Two more questions. Firstly, what are your employment conditions, and are you happy with them? I plan to institute an annual review of each employee's employment conditions with a view to determine whether they are still adequate, or whether they need improving.&quot;
He looked a little surprised at that. &quot;I am happy with my employment conditions,&quot; he responded. &quot;I am paid the same as a senior chef in any noble house in Tarantia, here I have my own cottage for my wife and children. I believe the lifestyle is better here, though there are times when my wife misses the city.&quot;
I nodded. &quot;We will be away from the estate for weeks at a time. I am sure we could arrange for you and your good wife to visit Tarantia from time to time when we are away and keep abreast of the latest recipes. Perhaps you could even supervise the purchase of ingredients you need.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;You wife might like to take the opportunity to keep up with the latest fashions, or visit her parents.&quot;
Vivaldo looked pleasantly surprised. &quot;That is very kind of you sir, lady.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;What about education for your children? Do they have the same opportunities as they would in the city?&quot;
&quot;Well my lady, I will train my son to be a chef, and I will teach him to read and write. He might learn quicker in Tarantia, but there is a teacher or two in Maldana.&quot;
Nalini turned to the rest of us. &quot;I'd like all the children on the estate to learn to read and write. Even the adults who can't should be offered the opportunity. We should have a teacher on staff.&quot; She made a note on her writing pad.
Prospero nodded &quot;I should have thought of that. You should see the major domo to arrange that.&quot;
&quot;Speaking of which&quot; I commented &quot;brings me to my second question. Master Vivaldo, how to find the staff here? Are any causing you problems? Do you get along well with Wilomo and Maraldo?&quot;
&quot;So far no problems, sir. Those two have been here for years, they recently had a falling out.&quot;
&quot;We thought that might be the case.&quot; Nalini commented. &quot;Master Vivaldo, do you know why they had a falling out? Now we have rehired Maraldo, they must work together again.&quot;
&quot;Well your ladyship, I should not really say this, but&quot; he leaned forward conspiratorially &quot;I believe that Wilomo has a sixteen year old daughter, and that Maraldo recently got her with child. Wilomo was furious, and threatened to have Maraldo killed if he did not leave your employment immediately.&quot;
&quot;Oh dear, that complicates matters. What happened to the girl? Is Maraldo married?&quot;
&quot;I believe the girl is kept locked inside the cottage. Maraldo left last month, and then Wilomo gave his cottage to one of his relatives, she is the senior maid. Maraldo is not married, he is a retired soldier.&quot;
&quot;Does he love the girl? Does she love him? Would he marry her do you think?&quot;
&quot;Well you ladyship, Maraldo is an old soldier with a soldier's ways, if you take my drift. He likes the girl, but I doubt he loves her. She must love him though. I think he would marry her if her father would let him.&quot;
&quot;This will take some delicate handling. Thank you for telling us master Vivaldo. Is there any other information like this that you know of?&quot;
&quot;Not that I can think of right now, your ladyship. I dare say the wife will know more about these things. 'Twas she who told me about Maraldo and Katerina&quot;
Nalini nodded &quot;We women often take more interest in personal matters. You must introduce me to your wife and children one day. I should like to get to know the families of all who work here.&quot;
We finished our interview, we chatted idly until Vivaldo finished his wine, and then he was politely shown the door.
We spoke with Wilomo's sister in law, a plump middle aged woman who was the senior housekeeper. She was responsible for all the cleaning staff, chambermaids and the like. She had only joined the estate a month ago, moving into Maraldo's cottage with her husband and three children. Her daughters worked as maids, her son was an apprentice chef in our kitchens. Her main complaint was that some of the maids were lazy or dirty, but she was slowly curing them of those vices. She said nothing about Maraldo, except that &quot;My brother in law says he is a coarse soldier. I had never seen him until today.&quot;
&quot;So you can tell us nothing about why he and your brother in law had a falling out?&quot;
&quot;Never mind, we will talk with each of them ourselves. We want to find out what happened, and see if we can get them to patch things up. If they are not friends, then it will not be in the best interests of the estate or the rest of the staff to have both of them working together.&quot;
She set her lips primly. &quot;My lady, I've no doubt that you will find out soon enough that this Maraldo is a bad character. Then you'll see the wisdom of giving him his marching orders.&quot; She concluded with a note of triumph.
 Next on the list was the major domo. Prospero had already explained to me that the major domo was responsible for everything that happened inside the house, including all the staff and finances, while the manager was responsible for everything that happened outside the house, including the ground staff, farm hands, and finances.
Wilomo entered, keen to show us around the house, but we suggested that could wait until later. &quot;Please, take a seat Wilomo, we would prefer this to be less formal. Would you like a glass of wine?&quot;
&quot;Thank you sir, that is most kind of you.&quot; Wilomo sat a little self-consciously. &quot;However, I must decline, I never drink when I am on duty.&quot; He sat forward, waiting for us to begin.
&quot;Firstly, this isn't an inquisition, we just need to know a little about how this estate is run. I will ask you to give us a detailed briefing at a later date, for now we just want an overview.&quot;
&quot;Very good sir.&quot; He nodded.
We sat looking at each other for a few seconds, until it became obvious he wasn't about to start with his overview.
&quot;I believe that you are in charge of everything that happens inside the house, and that the manager is responsible for everything that happens outside?&quot;
&quot;Er.. more or less sir. I control all the staff who work inside the house, I am responsible for ensuring that there is sufficient money to pay wages, buy food and supplies, see that all the staff work hard and that the house is run efficiently, and that every wish of our lord and master is obeyed promptly.&quot;
We nodded. &quot;As I recall, the head chef is responsible for the kitchens, and the head housekeeper is responsible for the maids. What other staff do we have?&quot;
There were a few. Apart from the cleaning staff and the kitchen staff, we had two seamstresses who were responsible for making and repairing clothes for the estate employees, a carpenter/cabinet maker who was responsible for any repairs to the house, and who could also make a variety of items, several scribes, a valet and a lady's maid, two butlers, one of whom was knowledgeable on wines, four bath house attendants, a coachman and five grooms, and four gardeners plus the head gardener. I may have forgotten one or two, and this list did not include farm hands who were the responsibility of the manager. There was also a squad of soldiers who acted as guards, but they were supplied by the army, and rotated on a weekly basis.
&quot;All this would be paid for out of the estate income? How big a percentage is it?&quot;
Wilomo looked nonplussed. &quot;I'm afraid I would have to have one of the scribes calculate that sir. The estates farms make much more than is required to pay for the staff or upkeep.&quot;
&quot;Okay, we might look into the books tomorrow. Who keeps the financial records? Do you do that, or do the scribes do that?&quot;
&quot;The scribes keep some of the financial records, I write some, and the manager also writes some.&quot;
&quot;And who authorizes spending money?&quot;
&quot;Well sir, in your absence, I authorize spending for the house, the manager authorizes spending money for the farms. I presume you would want to authorize all expenditure yourself?&quot;
&quot;I might, but I am inclined to set a limit, anything under that limit is for you or the manager to authorize, anything over that limit I or Nalini would authorize. I think we will wait until we have been through your records before we make any further decision. I take it your records are separate from the manager's records?&quot;
&quot;Yes sir, they are.&quot;
I was beginning to get a feeling that things needed a change. &quot;Where do we keep the money? And can you tell me how much we have on the premises?&quot;
&quot;Sir, there is a strong room in the cellar, the money is kept there. I don't think I could tell you exactly how much money is in there.&quot;
&quot;Could the manager?&quot;
&quot;I don't think so sir.&quot;
In other words, they each kept their own records of what they spent, but no one ever reconciled it to the amount of money in the strong room. I commented as much, and added &quot;Who has access to the strong room?&quot;
Wilomo was looking worried. No doubt it was crossing his mind that while I could not prove money was embezzled, neither could he prove it was not. &quot;Er.. Maraldo and I each have a set of keys.&quot;
&quot;And you only need one set of keys? You don't have to have both of you, each with keys the other does not have, to open the door?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Keys can be duplicated. When were the locks last changed?&quot;
&quot;Oh, just two months ago sir, when it was known that you would be the new lord.&quot;
&quot;Okay, now I hope I have not made a mistake in re-hiring Maraldo. Is he honest, in your assessment?&quot;
He looked hopeful, as if he had thought I might suspect him. &quot;I have no reason to believe he is not honest.&quot; He replied carefully.
&quot;And you are honest of course.&quot;
&quot;Certainly sir! You have my word on that!&quot;
&quot;And would Maraldo agree with your assessment of yourself?&quot;
The hope was gone from his eyes again. He was poker faced, careful. Quite possibly he was embezzling small amounts of money. &quot;The man has no honor, but I believe he would tell you I am honest.&quot;
&quot;This isn't an inquisition Wilomo, but since neither you nor the manager are sure how much money is in the strong room, and since neither of you ever reconcile your records, neither of you can be sure that nothing has ever been stolen. I will give some thought about changing the system of records so that I can reconcile your records and know how much money is in the strong room. I would also like to ensure that two people are required to open the strong room door, which would make it harder for a thief to copy keys, since he would need keys from both of you.&quot;
Wilomo nodded and looked relieved. &quot;Certainly sir.&quot;
&quot;Where are the keys now?&quot;
&quot;I have my set with me sir. They never leave my sight, even when I bathe!&quot; He reached into his jerkin and pulled out a set of four keys. They were the older style keys with a long shaft and a simple head, and I knew the locks would be simple to pick.
I commented mentally to Nalini &lt;&lt;We'll have to change those locks to ones from home as soon as possible&gt;&gt;
She agreed and made a note on her notepad. &lt;&lt;We could fetch some tonight. Do you need anything special to fit them?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;A battery powered drill and some screwdrivers. We have what we need in the garage back home.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Fine. We should get onto that tonight. I want to ask him about Maraldo.&gt;&gt;
&quot;Wilomo&quot; Nalini said &quot;The head housekeeper said that she thought Maraldo was not a good man, but she would not say why. You have said several times he has no honor, he is not a gentleman. You and he have worked together for several years, but recently you had a falling out. Could you please tell us what lead to this? And will it cause further problems in the future?&quot;
&quot;It.. it is a personal matter, your ladyship. But we can work together.&quot;
&quot;Wilomo, we will get to the bottom of this.&quot; Nalini sounded exasperated. &quot;I am asking you to give me your side of it before we talk with Maraldo. I appreciate that you may feel embarrassed about a personal matter, but we are your liege lord and lady. You should trust us sufficiently to tell us about this yourself.&quot;
Wilomo sighed resignedly. &quot;Very good your ladyship. I will say what I can, omitting nothing.&quot; He proceeded to tell us a tale about how Maraldo had been a friend, invited into his home to meet his wife and children, of how he had trusted Maraldo, until one day his wife had come to him and told him that his eldest daughter Katerina was with child, and that she named Maraldo as the father. Wilomo had flown into a rage, and threatened to have his relatives arrange for Maraldo to die. Wilomo was local, and had many relatives who would be glad to help him out in this. Maraldo was not local, and so had no relatives near by. Maraldo had left the same night, taking his records and keys with him.
&quot;This is a sad tale Wilomo.&quot; Nalini commented. &quot;What did you do to your daughter?&quot;
&quot;I would have flogged her, but she heard me arguing with Maraldo, and unbeknownst to us, she fled with him. They took lodgings somewhere in Arana. We have not seen her since, and my wife frets so.&quot;
Prospero observed &quot;By rights you can challenge him to a dual, but you may not arrange to kill him, that would be murder. Could you not consider marrying her to him?&quot;
&quot;But he betrayed our trust!&quot; Wilomo was obviously upset, he had forgotten to say sir to Prospero.
Nalini held up her hand to stop Prospero responding. &quot;An unwanted pregnancy is a sad thing. But a death would be even sadder. I take it that your daughter loves Maraldo?&quot;
Wilomo nodded. &quot;She told her mother that she does.&quot;
&quot;And what of Maraldo, does he love the girl?&quot;
&quot;He says he does. He came by a week later, with a party of guards, and we spoke. He apologized, and offered to marry the girl. But I was hot with anger, and rebuffed him. He returned again this morning, with his records and keys, and offered again to marry her. I am still angry over that, but my wife thinks we should accept his offer, especially since he has been re-employed.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;You have been wronged, but Maraldo has apologized, and offered restitution. It was unfortunate you had no lord to take this matter to when it occurred. Your lord would advise you that in law you may seek to punish the perpetrator, or you may seek restitution.&quot;
Nalini held up her hand again. &quot;Thank you Prospero, but could you wait a little? Wilomo, as Prospero said, you can seek punishment of Maraldo, but that would still leave your daughter pregnant, and deprive her of the man she says she loves. How old is she?&quot;
Wilomo had regained his composure. &quot;She will turn sixteen next month, my lady.&quot;
&quot;And would you not be seeking to marry her off not long after that?&quot;
&quot;Yes my lady, but there is little chance of that now.&quot;
&quot;If she were not pregnant, who would you have married her to? A distant relative? A wealthy merchant? Or perhaps some artisan or soldier?&quot;
&quot;She could not have caught a wealthy merchant, or his son. The best she could hope for would be a craftsman.&quot;
&quot;And such a man would probably be much older than she in any case.&quot; Wilomo nodded. &quot;Then if Maraldo had not abused your trust, he would in fact have been a suitable candidate?&quot;
&quot;Yes, the wife and I had discussed that subject perhaps a month before. She is of the opinion that if Maraldo will marry her, then it is as good a match as we could hope for and it would keep the girl nearby.&quot;
&quot;Then that would go a long way toward restitution, because the girl will have a husband to care for her. Is there anything else you think should happen before you would accept Maraldo as your son in law?&quot;
&quot;With your permission, my lady, I think I should discuss this with my wife...&quot;
&quot;You are a wise man, Wilomo. But I take it that you and she are at least not opposed to your daughter marrying Maraldo?&quot;
&quot;That is correct, my lady. My anger has cooled. He was my friend, and he is a good farm manager, so everyone says. He and I have talked this afternoon, though briefly. We have already decided we can work together.&quot;
&quot;Splendid! We will talk with Maraldo, you should go now and ask your wife if she will accept Maraldo as her daughter's husband.&quot;
&quot;Thank you, my lady. There is still the matter of the manager's cottage.&quot;
&quot;And what is that Wilomo?&quot; Nalini and I replied in unison.
He looked from one of us to the other. &quot;Oh.. it has been given to the head housekeeper, and we have no spare cottage near by.&quot;
&quot;Well, we shall not throw the head housekeeper out. We shall have to find another cottage for Maraldo. You had best talk with your wife, we should talk briefly with Maraldo. If he is agreeable, we will summon you and your wife to talk with him here in our presence. Where will we find you?&quot;
&quot;Oh, in the kitchens my lady, my wife is a cook.&quot;
&quot;Very well, you may go. Please send Maraldo in.&quot; He bowed and left rapidly.
 Maraldo entered carrying his record book, a heavy, leather bound volume. He bowed, the standard Aquilonian bow that is little more than a nod and a slight angling of the shoulders. &quot;My lords, my ladies.&quot; He was almost smiling.
&quot;Please take a seat Maraldo. Pour yourself some wine, we'd like this to be informal.&quot; I indicated the chair beside the table. Nalini sat opposite, with her notebook, I sat beside her. Paula and Prospero sat together on the far side of the room, with a small coffee table in front of them.
&quot;Well thank you sir.&quot; He sat and poured. &quot;Sir, please permit me to thank you for hiring me.&quot;
&quot;I hope we haven't acted hastily there, but we will get to that. We won't be going through your books today, but we would like an overview of what you manage.&quot;
The estate had extensive farmlands, and was almost self-sufficient. The surplus was sold either in the markets in Maldana, or to merchants in Arana. We grew wheat, rice, corn and barley, there were orchards and orange groves, several market gardens that grew a variety of vegetables, and a huge vineyard that had produced the wine we were drinking now. The wine had a slightly unusual flavor, but was very drinkable. Maraldo told us it was a mixture of red and white grapes, and was the vineyard's best. Prospero confirmed that Bendora estate was one of the better wines available in Tarantia.
There were thirty one permanently employed farm hands, all of whom lived in cottages scattered around the estate, plus casuals who would be hired to help during harvest season. That brought us to the subject of finances. Maraldo was able to tell us the estate brought in between twelve thousand and twenty thousand gold pieces per year, depending on the weather. A typical farm hand might be paid one gold piece per week, other staff might be paid similarly, the senior staff somewhat more. It seemed to me that the estate should show a handsome profit each year.
I asked Maraldo if he knew what the major domo's expenditure was, and whether he knew how much money was in the strong room.
&quot;Wilomo does not allow me to see his records, though he does tell me in general terms what has been spend in a month. This makes it impossible for me to determine whether money has been stolen. I have made a practice of counting the contents every six months or so, I could tell you what was there two months ago. I can understand if you would prefer that I do not know how much is there.&quot;
&quot;Hmm. We have to trust someone to mind the strong room when we are not here. I am not happy that you and Wilomo do not reconcile your records. This will change, tomorrow I will show you and Wilomo how I want the records to be reconciled. I intend to conduct an audit of the strong room, and after that an audit of everything on the estate that is valuable.&quot;
He nodded. &quot;Sir, I believe I can give an accurate record of everything that I manage. I have made it a practice to use the methods we used in the army when I was quartermaster, and I do conduct spot checks to verify that my records are accurate.&quot;
The impression was growing on Nalini and I that while it was possible both of them were embezzling, it seemed more likely that if anyone was, then it would be Wilomo.
&quot;It may be that someone has been stealing, and it is conceivable that Wilomo may be covering, or may be the perpetrator. But we will be unable to prove anything, so we will give all of you the benefit of the doubt. Once the audit has been conducted, we will be keeping an eye on things. Is the strong room guarded?&quot;
&quot;Sir, Wilomo will not permit guards inside the house.&quot;
&quot;Then we will change that tonight. We will discuss security arrangements with you later, after I have had time to think things over. We have enough soldiers to mount a guard?&quot;
&quot;Certainly sir, we have thirty soldiers who do little more than guard the gates, and ride escort. We can certainly arrange for two guards on permanent guard duty.&quot;
Prospero laughed &quot;Sounds as if a stint of duty here is a cushy number.&quot;
Maraldo smiled &quot;Many soldiers do look forward to a week at the manor.&quot;
Paula asked &quot;Won't they get bored guarding the strong room?&quot;
Maraldo grinned &quot;That they will, your ladyship, but a soldier's life is largely moments of intense excitement punctuated by periods of prolonged boredom.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;Maraldo, we have heard that you and Wilomo used to be good friends, but you had a falling out a month ago. It concerns us that you and he will have to work together again. Could you tell us in your own words what happened, and why?&quot; She smiled at him.
Maraldo looked serious. &quot;Well your ladyship, we are on our way to patching things up.&quot; Then he smiled wryly. &quot;It does not show me in the best light, but there's fault on both sides.&quot; Nalini nodded encouragingly, the rest of us said nothing.
Maraldo launched into a tale of Wilomo's daughter Katerina, and how they had grown fond of each other. He avoided the use of the word love, but said he had come to like her enough to ask her father for her hand. According to him, this had been refused on the grounds that he was too old for her.
&quot;'Tis true I'm no spring chicken any more, but I am two years younger than her father, and I would treat her well. Wilomo himself led me to believe he would be happy, but his wife wanted to marry her to a wealthy merchant in Maldana. So Katerina and I hatched a plan. When I tell it now, it does not seem to great, but it did seem to be good at the time.&quot;
&quot;If our foresight were as keen as our hindsight, most people would never do things they later regret.&quot; Nalini commented.
&quot;That is certainly true my lady. Well, to cut a long story short, I made Katerina pregnant, which would stop them from marrying her to the merchant. I told Wilomo I would marry the girl, but he threatened to have his relatives kill me, so I left, taking my records, keys and Katerina with me. I hoped that the records would give me a chance to speak with you and Earl Daniel about this matter.&quot;
&quot;So tell me, do you think you can patch things up with Wilomo and his wife? How would you like to resolve this?&quot;
&quot;My lady, had you asked me this morning I would have said I wanted three things: my old job as manager, Katerina as my wife, and friendship with Wilomo. Thanks to Earl Daniel I have the first, I hope that in the fullness of time I can gain the other two.&quot;
&quot;We hope to smooth this over as well, but you should think of an act of contrition that will appease Wilomo and his wife.&quot; Nalini replied.
&quot;My lady?&quot; Maraldo looked puzzled.
Prospero commented &quot;Maraldo, the girl is her father's responsibility until she turns sixteen, or marries. While Wilomo is wrong to seek your death, he is within his rights to demand you be punished, or that you make restitution to him in some way. Would you make restitution to him should he demand it?&quot;
Maraldo was obviously a retired officer, he gave us respect as superiors, but never was he obsequious as Wilomo could be. &quot;If he will permit me to marry Katerina, I will perform what ever restitution he demands, provided I can afford it. But if he will not permit it, then I must think about it.&quot;
&quot;Once she turns sixteen you no longer need her father's consent.&quot; Prospero observed. &quot;Restitution should be more aimed at regaining his friendship. Sorry Nalini, Danny, this is your show. But Maraldo will be able to marry soon regardless of what her father says, he has regained his job, yet he has transgressed against the parents. There needs to be restitution or punishment if the parents demand it.&quot;
Maraldo looked stern. &quot;If I must, I must. I will marry Katerina whether her parents approve or not. But what about Wilomo threatening me? Can I not demand punishment or restitution?&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;I was coming to that. Now you have admitted you are prepared to offer restitution, I can tell you that you may also demand restitution from him for his threats. Shall we summon Wilomo and let you both discuss this now?&quot;
&quot;Now is as good a time as any, your lordship.&quot;
Prospero reminded me to ring the bell to summon the butler. When he arrived, I sent him to fetch the major domo and his wife. They arrived within minutes.
Wilomo's wife was obviously younger than he, probably in her early thirties. She seemed a little flustered in our presence, as if so many nobles disconcerted her. She curtsied and stood awkwardly. I gestured to a sofa by the wall. &quot;Drag that over and the two of you can sit.&quot;
Prospero rose and grabbed one end of the sofa, over Wilomo's protests. Between the two of them they dragged the sofa into position, then he waved them to sit. He commented &quot;Danny, I should let you run this.&quot;
So the ball was back to me. There was no need to introduce ourselves, we had met Wilomo's wife earlier in the day. I smiled at them. &quot;Please don't feel discomforted, this isn't an inquisition. We would like to resolve the differences between you and Maraldo. Like I said earlier, we would like all of us to be like one big family. We would like all the staff to feel at home here, and we would like to feel we can all trust one another. Wilomo, have you and your wife come to a decision, or do you need more time to discuss it between you?&quot; They nodded. &quot;You are the wronged parties, so you have your say first.&quot;
&quot;Well sir&quot; Wilomo began &quot;we have decided that if Maraldo will make restitution to us, then we will agree to his marrying our daughter. We must look forward, not backward. The girl is with child, someone must marry her.&quot;
&quot;Maraldo, what do you have to say?&quot;
&quot;I have asked to marry Katerina before all this happened. If restitution be within my power to pay, I will make restitution.&quot;
&quot;Before we get to restitution, I have a few words to say to the three of you. Firstly, I believe that all of you have behaved badly in this matter. Firstly Wilomo, you refused Maraldo on the grounds that he was too old, when you were hoping to marry Katerina to a wealthy merchant who is even older. That was untruthful, and hypercritical. True, the merchant is wealthier, but Katerina does not even like him. Did you two meet before you married, or was it arranged by your parents without your consent?&quot;
I looked directly at the wife. She blushed before responding &quot;Sir, I first noticed Wilomo when I was but fourteen, we would go for walks through the orchard. We.. we fell in love, er.. then he asked my father for my hand.&quot;
Nalini asked gently &quot;How old were you when you married?&quot;
&quot;It was two months past my fifteenth birthday, your ladyship.&quot;
&quot;Wilomo, how old were you when you married?&quot;
&quot;I was twenty seven, my lady.&quot;
&quot;And how old are you now?&quot;
&quot;Forty two, my lady.&quot;
&quot;Maraldo, how old are you now?&quot;
&quot;My lady, I am forty next month.&quot;
&quot;Wilomo, how long had you been married when Katerina was born? She is your eldest child is she not? Forty two and twenty seven would seem to mean your daughter could be no older than fifteen.&quot;
Wilomo looked at his wife, she looked stricken. After what seemed like an eternity, Wilomo replied &quot;Five months, your ladyship.&quot; There seemed to be something wrong with his voice.
&quot;In other words, you two have behaved just the same as Katerina and Maraldo, except that your parents gave permission for you to marry. Don't you think you both behaved a little high handedly toward Maraldo?&quot; They both looked shocked, and couldn't seem to say anything.
Now it was my turn. &quot;Also Wilomo, you behaved badly by threatening to have Maraldo killed. That was not within your rights as the offended father. You do realize that Maraldo can demand restitution from you for that threat? It caused him to leave his job and flee for his life.&quot;
Wilomo seemed to be regaining his composure. &quot;I was angry sir, I spoke words I should not have spoken, and later regretted.&quot;
&quot;But it does not change the fact that you behaved more like a drunken lout in some dockside tavern. However, you did have provocation. Maraldo, you have behaved appallingly in this matter also. You are a retired centurion, you are expected to set an example as a leader of men, but you behaved more like a lowest ranking soldier. Perhaps if you were sixteen your youth and inexperience might be mitigating factors, but not for a forty year old retired centurion.&quot; I sighed theatrically and looked at them. &quot;All three of you should feel ashamed of your behavior. You two started things, Maraldo you made matters worse, and Wilomo you made matters worse still. Will you let this escalate to a full blown feud, or will you settle your differences like adults?&quot;
All three looked chastened. Maraldo spoke first. &quot;My behavior was appalling, I humbly beg your forgiveness. I offer my hand in friendship.&quot; He extended his hand.
Wilomo looked at his wife, who nudged him. He took Maraldo's hand and responded &quot;I accept your apology.&quot; He paused for a moment, released Maraldo's hand, and then intoned &quot;My behavior was appalling, I humbly beg your forgiveness. I offer my hand in friendship.&quot; The shook hands again while Maraldo accepted Wilomo's apology.
Prospero asked &quot;Goodwife, do you also accept this resolution?&quot;
She blushed and stammered &quot;I accept his apology. Do I also have to offer my hand?&quot;
&quot;Yes, if you accept, you must offer your hand.&quot;
&quot;I offer my hand in friendship&quot; She and Maraldo shook hands.
&quot;Now we come to the matter of restitution.&quot; I continued. &quot;I want each of you to name what you think is fair restitution for your troubles. Bear in mind that Maraldo can ask for the month's wages he has foregone.&quot;
Maraldo shook his head, but before he could speak, Prospero added &quot;And a month's wages is quite possibly fair restitution for Wilomo and his wife. Remember that you do not wish to beggar your prospective son in law, he must provide adequately for your daughter.&quot;
Maraldo stated &quot;I will offer five gold pieces, 'tis all that is left of my savings.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;When will you next be paid? How will you live until you are paid?&quot;
He shrugged. &quot;If we live here, we can eat in the kitchen with the other staff, we will not starve. I am not sure where we would stay though, since my cottage has been given to the housekeeper.&quot;
Wilomo's wife responded &quot;Maraldo, you should keep your savings, but do the right thing by our Katerina, marry her, make her happy, and look after her.&quot;
Nalini chimed in enthusiastically &quot;Splendid! We shall have a wedding on the estate! Wilomo, you should arrange the catering out of the estate funds, and make sure that it is good.&quot; Both Wilomo and his wife brightened at this suggestion. &quot;Danny, we need to consider building another house for them. In the meantime, you could stay in one of the spare rooms we have in the manor.&quot;
The three smiled tentatively at one another. Wilomo commented &quot;Your pardon, noble lords and ladies, but there are duties my wife must attend to in the kitchen. With your permission?&quot;
I gave it, but Nalini interrupted. &quot;Maraldo, where is Katerina right now?&quot;
&quot;Oh, she is in lodgings we have rented in Maldana. I should return to her.&quot;
Nalini looked concerned. &quot;Is she by herself there?&quot; Maraldo nodded. &quot;Can she travel? Ride a horse I mean.&quot;
&quot;That she can, my lady.&quot;
&quot;I feel that if she stays there tonight, she will be in danger. Take horses, an escort and what ever else you need, and bring her here tonight. I think there are still two hours before sunset. Wilomo, would you please prepare rooms for them here in the manor? And...&quot; she turned to Wilomo's wife &quot;what is your name dear?&quot;
&quot;Sondra my lady&quot; She sketched a curtsey.
&quot;Sondra is a nice name. Sondra, please make sure that there is hot food for Maraldo, Katerina and the soldiers. They are sure to be hungry when they return.&quot; She turned back to the two men. &quot;Tomorrow we will discuss housing, and look through both your records. Now, we would like to bathe and prepare for dinner.&quot;
The estate was organized to maintain enough hot water to fill one bath in one of the suites. The estate's public bathhouse used a separate supply of water that was heated during the afternoon and evening. The estate's employees would all bathe together late in the evening, the water would not be hot until then.
Since there was only enough hot water to fill Nalini's and my bath, the four of us shared the bath, which made it a little crowded. Still, we took the chance to soak for a while, and talk about the day's events.
Prospero commented &quot;I'm impressed that Nalini and you managed to resolve the issue of the manager.&quot;
Nalini responded &quot;I think the only reason we managed it was they were already prepared to resolve the issues. We just brought them to a head. I tried to find out from each of them separately what they thought would be the best outcome, and both of them agreed on the main points. There was no way we could force a resolution on them.&quot;
&quot;Thanks for offering the legal opinions Prospero, we don't know enough about Aquilonian law.&quot;
He chuckled. &quot;Our legal code isn't cut and dried like yours is, ours is much more flexible, and left to the interpretation of the judges. Precedent is used as a guide, but more important is the judge's interpretation of what is right and fair in the case before him. Keep ideas of fairness to the forefront and you'll do better than most nobles anyway. We are not judges, we do not need to be legal experts. If you find yourself in such a situation, call for a judge to offer advice.&quot;
&quot;What I don't understand&quot; Paula complained &quot;Is how a girl of sixteen can fall in love with someone old enough to be her father.&quot;
Prospero smiled ruefully. &quot;Paula, we have had this discussion many times. Traditionally a girl is married at fifteen. Most parents, and most daughters in fact, want to marry a man who can provide for them and their children. A man who is thirty or older is usually well settled into his career, if he will be successful the signs are evident by that age. Forty is not uncommon, many career soldiers do not retire until forty, and many of them have never married. They all want someone who can bare them children. Assuming Maraldo is honest, he is in secure employment, and will be paid well. For that matter, my own mother was but fifteen when she married my father, and he was thirty.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Paula it's the same in many countries. Girls trade their bodies for a better life. Why do you think we pretty ourselves up and wear make up and short skirts? Anyway, Prospero is older than you.&quot;
&quot;Yes, but he's only six years older. I'd have a problem if he was forty, and I'm twenty three, not sixteen.&quot;
Nalini and I had a private giggle about that. We were both closer to forty than thirty, but that hadn't stopped Paula making a play for me before Prospero had appeared on the scene.
Nalini looked at Paula for a few moments with a sly grin, then remarked &quot;I'm actually four years older than Danny, did you know that?&quot;
Paula knew, but Prospero didn't. &quot;I thought you were about my age, and Danny maybe a year or so older, though he only looks about my age.&quot;
Nalini replied &quot;We're both older than you Prospero, but you know that time runs at different speeds in different shadows. It's difficult to say exactly how old either of us is, so we judge our ages by the date in our home shadows.&quot;
&quot;Well, let me assure you Nalini that you look younger than Danny does. In fact, if I didn't know, I'd say you were probably younger than Paula.&quot;
&quot;That will happen to both of you now that you are practicing sorcery. You will not age much. Danny has only been practicing for a year or two, whereas I have been practicing for at least eighteen years now. And since you both want to know how old I am, I started learning from Korum when I was twenty. I like to think I haven't aged much since then. Danny was over thirty before he started, so he will have that disadvantage, he will always look older than I!&quot;
Later, the conversation turned to our staff. &quot;Prospero, what is your assessment of Maraldo and Wilomo? Are they honest? Can we trust them?&quot;
&quot;I've been thinking about that since we learned that both of them have unsupervised access to the strong room. Wilomo does not let Maraldo see his records, which suggests he has something to hide. He has the opportunity to steal money without anyone noticing. Maraldo claims he keeps accurate records, but he might only claim that. As quartermaster, he would know how to juggle records so they seem complete, yet hide theft. Also, the farm income passes through his hands, so it would be very easy for some of it to stick. For now you have to trust them, but I would test each of them without letting either of them know.&quot;
&quot;You might have to make some suggestions about how we can do that. We were going to change the strong room locks tonight, and make it so that they have only half the keys each. You know we will introduce accounting style bookkeeping, and reconcile from Maraldo's last known total. But all that means is that the records will match with the total, it doesn't stop them from stealing, and certainly not from stealing money before it is entered.&quot;
Paula commented &quot;They don't usually issue receipts here, so you can't just go to merchants and check what they paid for something.&quot;
I nodded. &quot;Makes it a little harder. The usual accounting procedures are separation of function, so that the person who has access can't authorize expenditure, and vice versa, and making sure there is a paper trail. Probably the hardest aspect will be the income, since all payments pass through Maraldo. If any of you have any ideas, let us know.&quot;
The six of us ate in the formal dining hall. I would have preferred somewhere smaller, since this room could have sat hundreds. However, the only other place was the small staff dining room. Prospero advised against joining them. &quot;You will make all of them nervous. They will feel they are all under scrutiny.&quot;
The meal included some vegetarian dishes for Nalini and me, and the chef seemed to have done a an excellent job with the meal. Prospero was happy that what he ate was equal with what he could obtain back in Tarantia. Coffee was as yet unknown here, but we had brought a supply of our own, much to the interest of the butler and some of the kitchen staff.
After dinner all six of us went for a walk through shadow to a hardware store, and returned an hour later with several bags of equipment, tools and hardware. Some of the things we bought included a portable electric generator, powered by propane gas, electric power tools and lights, as well as some specialist deadlocks. We could have bought a safe, but none of us could have carried it.
We chased up Wilomo for his keys to the strong room, and then Prospero and I set to work while a number of onlookers watched in awe. The audience included Wilomo and Maraldo, only recently returned from Maldana, Liz, Rupert and Paula. Wilomo carried a lantern.
The cellar was extensive, holding preserved food, barrels of wine and many other stores sufficient to feed the entire staff for perhaps several months. The strong room was in the middle of the cellar, and seemed to be constructed of stone blocks cemented together. There were no windows, and only one door. I turned to Prospero and Rupert. &quot;Weak point is the floor, it's dirt, and can be easily dug through. The ceiling is possibly another. Wilomo, what is overhead?&quot;
&quot;Oh, I believe this area would be the staff dining room, while over that way is the main dining hall. The kitchen is behind us, and the servants' quarters extend to our right.&quot;
&quot;Thank you. So it would be possible to cut through the floor above.&quot;
We started work by the somewhat dim light of an oil lamp. We hooked up the gas bottle to the generator, opened taps, and cranked the handle until it started. It functioned on the same principles as any diesel or petrol generator except that it burned bottled propane gas and was considerably lighter. Next came a couple of fluorescent lights, which caused consternation amongst the onlookers who had never seen them before.
We had Wilomo open the strong room, and entered. The strong room was essentially a small room lined with shelves. The ceiling was wooden planks, as was the floor.
Maraldo commented &quot;I think those wooden planks are about an inch and a half thick. It would be possible to break through them, but I think it would make some noise.&quot;
&quot;Only if there is a guard to hear that noise.&quot;
In the center was a desk and chair, and writing implements, along with several sacks of coins and small wooden box. On the floor were a number of wooden chests, and there were leather sacks on the shelves. Every chest and almost all the sacks were sealed with wire, ribbon and sealing wax. We opened a couple to display gold coins. Wilomo opened the chests one by one to display gold and silver coins filling them. It looked like a lot of money. Then he and Wilomo heated sealing wax, and resealed the chests and sacks we had opened. Each one pressed their own seal ring into the wax.
Maraldo confirmed my guess. He consulted his record book &quot;Last time I counted, there were eighteen thousand two hundred and seventy one gold crowns, two thousand one hundred and twenty three gold half crowns, one thousand seven hundred and fourteen silver florins, one thousand three hundred and thirty seven silver shillings, nine hundred and one silver half shillings, two thousand four hundred and fifteen copper pennies, twelve hundred and forty eight copper half pennies, and four hundred and eleven copper farthings.&quot;
&quot;It must have taken you a while to count all of that. How can you be sure it is accurate? Especially if money is coming in and going out while you are counting?&quot;
&quot;Oh no my lady. When I first took up my position, some chests were sealed, but some weren't. I brought a squad of soldiers from the barracks, and together with Wilomo and the scribes we counted every single coin in every chest and sack. We had soldiers counting, and others watching to make sure nothing was stolen. We sealed each sack, and each sack should contain the same number of coins. On subsequent counts we checked the seals of each sack and chest, and counted the chests and sacks. The open sacks were counted again, and we opened several sacks at random to check them. The number of sealed sacks should always increase, since we make more money from the farms that we spend.&quot;
&quot;And the more this increases, the more it will become a temptation for thieves.&quot; I commented. &quot;Well, so far, you two have impressed me with your honesty, and your efforts to ensure that nothing is stolen. But keys can be copied, both of you must sleep and bathe. We are about to change the locks, and from now on, both of you must be present to open the strong room door, because each of you will have the keys to only half the locks.&quot;
Maraldo nodded. &quot;It makes sense sir. Would you have a complete set yourselves?&quot;
Wilomo pursed his lips as if this would be an inconvenience, but nodded and said nothing.
&quot;We would, so we can open the strong room, and if one of you needs to, then one of us can open it. When we are away, it makes sense to us that both of you must be present to open the strong room. I would also ask that no one be allowed in here alone, and that there always be two guards on duty around the strong room. That fortune would be a very attractive target for thieves. It is not that I don't trust either of you, but alone it would be very easy for a thief to knock you out. Half the keys each means that a thief must rob both of you in order to obtain complete set of keys.&quot;
I don't think either Maraldo or Wilomo realized we intended to install the locks ourselves until Prospero and I began drawing with pencil on the door to indicate where we had to drill.
&quot;Sir,&quot; Wilomo protested &quot;Should we not send for the carpenter?&quot;
&quot;Maybe, but I think we'll be quicker. Plus, the fewer people who know about what is inside here the better.&quot;
&quot;Of course, I should have thought of that.&quot;
The old locks were much larger than the new ones, so I decided to leave the basic mechanism in place and remove the tongues so they couldn't be used. Then Prospero held the door while I used the electric drill, though we did take it in turns. The drill caused much comment from those in the audience who had never heard of an electric drill. It might have taken a carpenter with a hand drill and hammer and chisel all day to fit the four locks, we had the entire job done in little over an hour.
The final thing we had to fit was guards for the lynch pins. Otherwise all the locks on the one side of the door could be circumvented by the simple expedient of using a hammer and screwdriver to knock the lynch pins out of the hinges and pulling the entire door off.
We swept up, much to the consternation of Wilomo who wanted to call a servant, then presented Wilomo and Maraldo with their keys, two each.
Maraldo turned his over, remarking &quot;These are very odd looking keys!&quot;
The key was a Y shape in cross section, and each arm of the Y was notched. &quot;It's designed to make the lock almost impossible to pick, and impossible to duplicate the key without special equipment.&quot; I pointed to the notches. &quot;Each notch corresponds to a pin inside the lock barrel, there are nine pins along each of three rows. So a thief must push twenty seven pins to the correct height at the same time, and each pin must be pushed to a different height. It is also difficult to take a wax impression.&quot; I didn't add that a skilled jewelry maker might be able to duplicate a key should a careful thief take a wax indentation impression of each pair of arms. No point in giving them ideas.
Maraldo looked thoughtful. &quot;Then the strong room is now impregnable sir.&quot;
I shook my head. &quot;No strong room is impregnable, but the trick is to stay one or two steps ahead of the thieves, and to have things in place to detect if a robbery occurs. If you were down here in the strong room by yourself, it would be very easy for a thief or two to hide in the shadows down here, and sneak up and over power you.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;I don't think the guards should be allowed to see what is in the strong room, but they should accompany you into the cellar. That way any thief still has to make his way past the guards.&quot;
I added &quot;You two should be aware that if it becomes known about the contents of this strong room, there will be many thieves who will stop at nothing to get hold of it, including killing or torturing you to obtain the keys, or kidnapping your families. You are probably reasonably safe here on the estate, but you should take care. Always take soldiers with you when you leave the estate, and that applies to your families. You should leave your keys with the soldiers, or somewhere that will be guarded around the clock. We need to have enough soldiers to patrol the estate and accompany you if you need it. I'm not sure if thirty is adequate.&quot;
Prospero responded &quot;Fifty might be a better number, you simply request the commanded of the barracks to supply extra soldiers. Maraldo, you should work out a guard roster so you have an idea of how many guards we need.&quot;
Maraldo nodded. &quot;I will do that, and I can convey that to the commander if you wish, sir.&quot;
&quot;It's okay, I'll be seeing him sometime in the next few days, I'll ask him then. Tomorrow we will purchase a safe that we can situate upstairs, we'll keep small amounts of money there for estate use, and the current record books. That way there will be less need to visit the strong room. We will set aside one room for the scribes and for you to maintain your records, and put the safe in there. We can arrange for a pair of guards to watch the room. You two will obviously need keys to the safe, but perhaps your keys to the strong room should be kept in the safe.&quot;
Wilomo responded &quot;Sir, we have never had a robbery here in over three hundred years. Do you really think we are in danger?&quot;
&quot;Probably a lot less than if we were close to Tarantia. But all it takes is one careless word in a tavern and we'll have thieves coming out of the woodwork. A couple of people could live in luxury for years on the gold in there.&quot;
Maraldo commented &quot;That is certainly true sir. One thing I must add is that in the army we always tried to anticipate problems and be ready if they ever happened. I believe we should prepare for thieves, they are a risk.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;We could even purchase two or three safes, with half the keys in one safe, and the other half in the other safe. You could divide your set the same way, and have your own set of keys to the safe.&quot;
&quot;I think we all agree.&quot; I replied. &quot;And now gentlemen, ladies, I think we have had enough excitement for one night. Tomorrow we have the councilors from Maldana coming to brief us, we'd like to make a start on reconciling your records, and we have to buy a safe. We have to find time to inspect the property, and meet with the councilors from other cities. I think I will be reasonably busy for the next few weeks.&quot;
Prospero began packing tools while I disassembled the generator. We found an empty shelf and deposited everything there. Then we headed back upstairs.
Nalini commented &quot;We need to get a diary to schedule our time while we're here. We have things to do in Brisbane as well, we will be making a number of trips. Liz, how long before you have to go home?&quot;
Liz shrugged. &quot;As long as I call them regularly, I can probably stay away for a couple of months.&quot;
Nalini smiled. &quot;You will have to work on them. I have to call mine regularly, but they only expect me to visit every now and then. But I don't want to be away for too long, we should have the English back within a month at the latest.&quot;
 We were busy over the next few weeks.
One by one, the cities of the region for which I was now lord sent their councilors to meet with me and brief me. Nalini attended these briefings, as did Prospero. Prince Rupert attended the first few, then satisfied that he understood what we were working to achieve, he stopped attending. Paula and Liz did not attend, they found other things to occupy them.
Part of the briefing was exactly that, I wanted to know what the council did, and what they administered. Another part involved Prospero and I telling them how things needed to change. We needed to coordinate that the entire region was administered, that the roads were maintained, taxes collected and sent to Tarantia. I wanted a regional council that would advise me and help to administer the region, but would work through the city councils where it could. For that I required each of the city councils to appoint one of their number to attend briefing sessions with the other appointees and with me. We would meet for as many days as the business at hand required and then schedule the next meeting in about a month, depending on the urgency of matters. Each meeting would be scheduled at a different city, in rotation, and that would also give me a chance to attend council meetings for that city. There were some grumblings, but the magic words &quot;this is how the king wants it&quot; usually worked.
Arana council demurred, wanting to hold all meetings in Arana. I ended up pulling rank and telling them &quot;This is fair to all the other town councils, why should you be any different? I'm sorry you disagree, but this is how it will be. Please feel free to write to the king if you are unhappy with this decision. Don't forget I could be selfish and order all meetings at the estate.&quot;
They gave in at that point. Prospero thought they were just flexing their muscles, but like a young buck challenging the old bull, had given way when push came to shove.
Prospero and I also had to explain about the new parliament and how it would work. One of Nalini or I had to attend sessions of the House of Lords, one member of my advisory committee would accompany me as the member of the House of Commons. The member of commons job attracted a salary of two hundred and fifty crowns per year, which equated to about seventy five thousand dollars in our own terms. In addition, every councilor would be paid one hundred crowns per year as a retainer. This was not a fortune to the rich merchants who made up the bulk of the councilors, but it was an incentive, and meant that people who weren't rich could try for councilors and have a chance of feeding their families.
This money was to be paid for out of the taxes that the estate collected from the region. Tax was levied on every male over the age of sixteen, and was levied at two gold crowns per person, regardless of income. I am sure there were those for who even this low level of tax was a burden, but tax reform had to be agreed by king Amrik.
The incentives for someone to attend the parliament were not quite sufficient for most councilors given they would spend two or three weeks away from home at a time. However, I pointed out to them &quot;King Amrik is quite happy to extend this opportunity to all citizens, be they sheep herder or ditch digger. I can imagine that there would be a number of people who would jump at the chance of an income like that. If I can't get one of the council to volunteer, I am afraid the king requires me to throw the position open to all who want it. I would of course restrict it to those who can read and write, but maybe in the first instance you councilors could suggest suitable candidates? If the person chosen is agreeable to the council I am sure that King Amrik would endorse their choice, and not enquire exactly how the selection was made.&quot;
All the councils saw the wisdom of having a candidate of whom they approved, they all managed to provide a candidate. In some cases these were the mayor's son or close relative. I had to work with the councils, though I intended to make the processes more democratic over time. The problem was partly that in this world nepotism was seen by many people to be good sense.
The final selection was made by all the councilors sitting together. We had invited them all to the estate for the day, though many from distant towns would stay overnight at Maldana. Each candidate had to give a short speech about why he would be the best person for the House of Commons. Then we conducted a secret ballot, where every candidate's name was written on the ballot paper, and each councilor had to mark his or her own ballot paper with the numbers from one to nine. The ballots went into a wooden box, and when the voting was finished Prospero and I tallied the results on a blackboard.
I could see the reasoning behind not having open democratic elections yet - we needed to teach people what it was about, and we needed an army of workers to supervise the proceedings.
You might think that each councilor would have voted for his own candidate, and so we would have nine candidates with equal votes, but that was not the case. We tallied the primary votes under the watchful eye of the councilors, and placed each vote into one of nine bundles. The spread of votes was wide, so it was obvious that some councilors had voted for another council's candidate. The candidate with the fewest votes was eliminated, and their second preferences distributed. The process went on until one candidate emerged with more than fifty percent of the votes. There was some discontent with the result, especially with Arana, which as the biggest town had wanted their candidate to win.
After we declared the results, I announced that all the candidates would constitute my advisors, and would receive an allowance for that. I also told them that the next elections would be in a year, and would draw again from my advisors. There was some discussion about how long an advisor should serve for, since councilors were more or less for life.
Prospero told them all &quot;For the present, councilors for the regional council will serve a term of five years, though that may change later if there are problems. Many of you will have business interests, and may not be able to afford the time away from your businesses. This is why we pay a salary to the councilors and the parliamentary member. The king would like to extend the five-year term to all councils, so that they have to be chosen by the people. The process will be similar to what we used for selecting the parliamentary candidate. People who wish to serve on the town council for five years can put their names down, and those who vote will hold a secret ballot to choose councilors. Somewhere between nine and twelve councilors seems a good number.&quot;
There was a lot of resistance to the idea of councilors being elected by people, instead of being selected by the existing councilors as currently happened. Prospero said the magic words &quot;This is how the king has decreed it will happen. It is up to all of us to make that happen. We have briefed each of the councils in our visits to their cities. One of the tasks for Lord Danny's regional council will be to co-ordinate this. We will need your co-operation for this to work. I have already set this up in my own estate, I will be spending time here ensuring that things are done in accord with the king's will. I am sure all of you realize we are reasonable men, we want something workable, even if it is not quite up to what the king has decreed as his ideal situation.&quot;
I could see that there were wheels turning inside many councilors' heads. We had offered them the stick of how the king wanted it done and the carrot of being able to make some changes that might better suit them. Good old self interest!
Voting was to be open to all men and women who were citizens. This required some way of determining who was a citizen. The other option was to all taxpayers, but that would currently restrict it to adult males. I might note that one tax reform that Amrik was considering was to lower the tax, but apply it to all adults, regardless of sex. There was a census planned for the next few months, with a registrar to be compiled of all families. That had been a regular occurrence under the old kings, but had not happened since Amrik had assumed the throne. Prospero had told me privately that once the census had been taken, the adults would then be voters and would also be taxpayers. The records would be adjusted each year as the tax collectors went through the land.
Social change takes time, and a properly working democratic system would take years to develop. People needed to be educated about their civic duties and about how government works.
There were other activities to keep the regional council busy. One was ensuring that all citizens could obtain four years' schooling. There was as yet no standard curriculum, that would come later once the infrastructure had been set up. First we required teachers, schoolrooms and pupils. In the towns this would be relatively easy, but outlying areas would be a problem.
A second activity was augmenting the king's courier service into the royal mail, capable of delivering letters anywhere in the kingdom, and available to all citizens. Initially it would be between the main towns only, but that was a big improvement over existing facilities. Mail outside Aquilonia would still be at the mercy of travelers, but there was a good chance that other nations would copy Aquilonia.
A third one was the creation of a police force, relieving soldiers of policing duties. Aquilonia was very much at the stage of training the trainers, but the idea of a special force for the investigation and prevention of crime was popular. Many in the initial intake of police might be recruited from the army, but the idea was there. I also instituted the idea of a neighborhood watch, where the citizens in an area would assume the basic crime prevention duties for the area in which they lived. We even borrowed an idea from the old English Bobbies- that of the bobby's whistle to attract the watch should their presence be required.
Other matters included road maintenance, ensuring there were patrols along all of the roads, and sending the army to track down any highway men.
Add to that the necessity for going to Tarantia for the parliament and I think you'll realize that there was much to do in Aquilonia before anything else. I could understand better why Prospero did not spend more time in my home shadow.
The estate kept us busy at first. We spent time touring around it, looking at everything. As I have said previously, the place was a working farm and produced almost everything it consumed. Prospero and I tried out hand at introducing coffee plants, but it would be years before we would know if the venture would pay off.
Nalini and I bought three safes, one for the major domo, one for the manager, and one for us. The keys to the strong room were kept inside the respective safes, as was the working capital that each required for day to day running of the estate. Paula, Liz and I taught Wilomo, Maraldo and the scribes the essentials of bookkeeping, and reconciled our records. There was money missing, five hundred and forty gold pieces to be precise, but we made the pretence of accepting the excuse that there had been errors in record keeping.
I commented &quot;It is possible the old keys were copied, and someone stole money that way. It may be too late to find out now. However, we have new locks on the strong room, I put you both on notice that if money is missing in the future I will hold the two of you jointly responsible.&quot; There were no protests, I think both of them realized that as keepers of the keys, they were the only ones who could have access.
I continued &quot;You each have your own safe, and the money in you safe is you own responsibility. Any questions?&quot;
Maraldo looked at Wilomo. &quot;See, I told you we needed guards on the strong room!&quot;
Wilomo asked &quot;What will you do about the missing money?&quot;
&quot;We will investigate, through the trail may be rather cold by now. From the accounting point of view, we write it off as theft.&quot;
Prospero added sternly &quot;You two can think yourselves fortunate that it is king Amrik on the throne, and that you don't have one of a dozen lords I can name in Danny's stead. Some would think nothing of torturing both of you until you confessed.&quot; Both men blanched. &quot;However, we are trying to distance ourselves from such barbarities, torture is illegal, and Earl Danny is a compassionate man.&quot;
I added &quot;Under king Sorono, you would have been considered guilty unless you could prove your innocence. Under king Amrik, you are innocent until proven guilty. But that does not mean you can get away with crimes. As I said, you are now jointly responsible for the money in the strong room.&quot;
It wasn't obvious who had stolen the gold, but the quantity suggested only one person. That many coins would weigh thirty-five and a half pounds, or sixteen kilograms, about the sort of weight a man could carry without staggering. There were no obvious signs of spending around the estate; it might be possible to locate the money if we searched the belongings of every one on the estate, or it might be buried somewhere.
We started a project to modernize the plumbing in manor, but that would take some months to reach fruition. I had a mind to install a gas or electric powered fridge as well. Cooking here like everywhere relied on fresh produce since there was no refrigeration. About the only way to preserve food during winter was pickling, cooking with sugar, or salting. Fortunately Aquilonia has mild winters, and fresh produce could still be obtained.
It wasn't all work. Nalini and I spent hours with the dog rambling around the estate, just getting to know where everything was. Sometimes Maraldo would accompany us, though he preferred riding, claiming he had done enough walking while in the army. More often Paula and Prospero would accompany us, and frequently Liz and Rupert. The two of them seemed to be getting along well, though Liz was of the opinion it was a holiday romance. Though they shared a suite, that wasn't as intimate as it sounds, in Aquilonian terms a suite consists of two bedrooms, a shared bathing area, and a shared lounge area.
Prince Rupert was slightly envious. As the third son, he was very much the poor cousin. My understanding was that he had no lands to inherit, and no country estate. He certainly gave me the impression that he would have loved to have an estate like Bendora for his own. He took a great deal of interest in everything that went on, and how it was run. I think he might have been more suited to lord of Bendora than Nalini and I.
Nalini and I told him he would always be welcome to visit us either at our estate or any other shadow in which we happened to be living.
He responded &quot;I thank you both for your gracious offer. But without your abilities I cannot come visiting.&quot;
&quot;Consider it an incentive. We will teach you if you can find us in dreaming. Imladril has also made that offer, so it is up to you. Liz is learning, one day she will be able to do what we can do.&quot;
He seemed to be thinking long and hard about things.
One initiative of Nalini's was she had Wilomo compile a register of everyone on the estate, along with their dates of birth. She arranged that each person be given a gold crown on their birthday and that there be a feast in their honor if they wanted it. With fifty of more employees plus their families, there were quite a few days where several people were celebrating their birthdays.
Nalini also issued instructions that when someone was sick, the estate would pay for a physician to attend that person if he or she needed it. Physicians here were not like western doctors, but were more like herbalists able to diagnose illnesses and prepare herbal remedies, set bones and so on. They did not deliver babies, that was the job of the midwife.
Each town has a small number of physicians, who collectively form the town's physician's guild. Maldana has twenty one physicians, two of whom are female, proving that Aquilonia was moving along the path of equality; Arana has sixty seven physicians, ten of whom are female. There is no school of medicine; a physician usually follows in his or her father's footsteps by serving an apprenticeship. Some physicians will take on others as trainees, and some retired physicians will set up schools that will train hopefuls for a fee. These schools tend to falter when their founder grows too old or dies. Tarantia does have a royal college of physicians, intended by a previous king to train physicians to a standard suitable to treat the royal family, but the fees are beyond the reach of all but the richest merchants. You can probably appreciate there is wildly varying levels of skill and knowledge between physicians.
Prospero and Amrik were now convinced of the need to train all physicians to the same level, and ensure that medical best practice was disseminated. That would of course take years to achieve. Nalini meanwhile took things in our region into her own hands. I should point out that she does have several years of medical training, though she never completed her medical course. Korum and shadow shifting intervened, plus she found she preferred working with computers. &quot;They aren't as icky and messy.&quot; she says.
Nalini decreed that she would become the patron of each town's guild of Physicians. The physicians thought that harmless enough, until she began finding out about treatments and diagnosis procedures, and issuing changes. Nalini was armed with several books on medicine from her own shadow, and had enough medical knowledge to defeat most physicians when it came to debate. That may give you some idea of the medical standards in Aquilonia, when someone with a half-complete medical degree knows more about medicine than the local physicians. Of course, our own standards of medicine just one hundred years ago were even more appalling. Aquilonian physicians at least knew about the connection between dirt, contamination and disease; a hundred years ago most western physicians didn't.
There was initial resistance to Nalini's suggestions, but as there was no medical board that issued licenses, they could only judge her by her successes and failures. I think the turning point came when she issued instructions to all physicians about the preparation and use of penicillin. The few who believed her proved just how effective the treatment was, and suddenly she gained a reputation for medical expertise. It was a step, albeit a small one.
Many modern treatments could not be used due to the absence of equipment and drugs. However, most modern wonder drugs are synthetic derivatives of the active ingredients from plants. Nalini and I scoured several shadows including our own for good books on herbal remedies. We needed the large encyclopedic ones with colored pictures of every plant so we could recognize them. That gave us another project - to write an Aquilonian herbal medicine manual, based on the information in these manuals, augmented by information the physicians volunteered. The division between physician and apothecary was only just beginning, with some physicians deciding to specialize on creating herbal preparations. As a general rule however, physicians did not dispense medical preparations, but would have their assistants parcel up bundles of dried herbs, which the patient would take home and cook.
Prospero suggested another business enterprise - sourcing the herbs written up in the herbal manual, and distributing them to all physicians across Aquilonia. Many physicians still had their assistants gather the herbs locally, though there were specialist herbalists who grew hard to gather herbs. But there was no one coordinating things so that any physician in Aquilonia could order all medical herbs. Such a business also needed a postal service, otherwise the cost of couriers would be prohibitive.
 Maldana has a population of about thirty thousand people, about four thousand five hundred of which are active soldiers. Perhaps another twelve to fifteen thousand are soldiers' families, the rest of the population work at jobs that provide support facilities for the army. Arana is the biggest city in the region, with a population estimated at between seventy thousand and one hundred thousand. It is the major clearinghouse for the region's produce, and the port through which all goods entered and exited. As such, there is quite a floating population of sailors as ships come and go. In addition, Arana has between fifteen hundred and two thousand soldiers, with their families.
The other seven major towns are somewhere between ten thousand and fifty thousand people. This of course leaves out smaller towns, but they are all much smaller, having less than one thousand people all up. The major towns all have town councils, the smaller ones mostly have no councils and may have no authority figure at all. One of our tasks was to assist in creating an administrative infrastructure that included all of these smaller towns. That wasn't necessarily town councils, but at the least locating a few people who were willing to take the job and who had the respect of a reasonable proportion of the townspeople. Of course, this begs the question of when it is a town, and when is it a village.
Nalini and I had few staff on whom we could rely for this, so we delegated the task to the army. They had some sort of garrison in every town/village with more than one hundred and fifty taxpayers, which gave us a working separation between town and village. A town would have some sort of council, a village would come under the umbrella of the nearest town. Often the garrisons were little more than a squad of ten soldiers commanded by the equivalent of corporal, let's say a decurion. A decurion was at least capable of reading and writing, and some arithmetic.
The decades or squads of ten men were formed into centuries of ten squads or one hundred soldiers. A centurion, an officer something like a lieutenant or captain, commanded each century. There were also four sergeants who were each responsible for about twenty five soldiers, except that in practice they had two or three squads to make the numbers come out even. Thus a century of one hundred soldiers actually comprised one hundred and fifteen men once you included the ten decurions, four sergeants and one centurion. Those officers were in the field with their men, so that if there were ten squads spread amongst five towns, one would also host the centurion and the other four might host a sergeant each. Of course, not every century had the requisite number of sergeants.
Whoever was the highest ranking officer in a town became the town's official contact. He had the power to co-opt town leaders to form a committee if the town had none. If the town already had one, then he became the town's liaison officer, with orders for the town council that this officer was the king's representative at their council. I know this sounds a bit like military rule, but the army had the organizational infrastructure spread throughout the region and it had people who had some training in leadership as well as following orders. Using the military was also the only practical way that I could issue a proclamation and have it read in every village in the region. And since I was the military commander for the region, I planned to make use of the manpower available.
The royal mail service would build on the army's infrastructure. The existing royal courier service was provided by the army, but was for the king, nobles who were military commanders and the military to dispatch messages. The courier service was provided at no charge, but the royal mail would be based on cost recovery. It would also mean that the local command post would also become the local post office. The military was reasonably happy with the idea, especially since there would be many more jobs for non-combatants, provided they could read and write. Career soldiers who were getting too old to fight would no longer have to retire and look for other work.
As you can see, Nalini and I had much to keep us occupied. And I thought that being the lord of an estate would be a holiday! Nalini wants me to add the comment that we could have treated it like a holiday if we had left everything as it was, but since we cared about the people we felt under an obligation to make a difference. Looking back we can see that we have made quite a difference. But I am getting ahead of myself.
We had been at the estate only four days when the puritans and king Charles arrived. It was early evening, about half an hour before the evening meal was to be served. Wilomo sent a servant girl to interrupt our bath to inform us of the arrival.
&quot;What is Wilomo doing right now?&quot; I asked the girl.
&quot;Sir, he is outside in the corridor, awaiting your instructions.&quot; I noticed her eyes kept straying to Nalini sitting in the water beside me, but probably that was from simple curiosity about Nalini's dark skin.
Nalini noticed too, and winked at her. &quot;In case you're wondering, I'm dark all over.&quot;
&quot;My lady, I wasn't...&quot; she began.
&quot;It's all right, I'm used to it. Many pale skinned people haven't seen someone with dark skin before.&quot; She checked with me, then continued &quot;You might as well send Wilomo in, this needs to be dealt with now.&quot;
Wilomo entered, the girl trailing behind. &quot;My lord, my lady, we have a party of visitors arrived. There is the king of England, the dowager duchess of Poitain, three of the king's knights, seven of his advisors, the Queen of the Viharani with her consort, her brother a prince whose name escapes me with his wife, baron Laredo and his son plus some servants. We do not have enough suites, but we do have sufficient guestrooms. I am having them all prepared, and I have instructed the kitchen to prepare extra food. I doubt we will have sufficient hot water for them all either.&quot;
&quot;I guess you'll just have to do your best with the hot water. Maybe in future the hot water for the bathhouse should be heated before dinner, and kept hot for the evening. Umà consult duke Prospero about whether his mother will share a suite with the king of England. The three knights and the seven advisors do not need suites, just guestrooms. They will probably be happy with bowls of hot water, the English do not enjoy bathing as we do here. The king would want a bath, as will the Viharani. If we don't have enough suites to go round, the Viharani are two couples, they only need two bedrooms, and they could share a suite. If anyone has their noses out of joint over the accommodation, they will just have to accept that this isn't the palace at Tarantia, we don't have hundreds of guest suites.&quot;
&quot;Certainly sir, I will make those arrangements.&quot; He was being very proper in front of the servant girl. &quot;Some of the dinner preparations might not be ready in time, should I delay dinner? It should not be more than another half hour.&quot;
&quot;Delaying would be best. Find out when the chef says he will be ready without rushing him, and set dinner for then.&quot;
&quot;Certainly sir. We will enquire of each person whether they require to bathe before dinner, or are content to wash now and bathe later.&quot; He paused for a moment. &quot;With your leave sir?&quot;
&quot;Oh, sure. You don't need to wait for me to tell you to go. You've asked for instructions, I've given them. But if it makes you feel happier, you may go Wilomo. Thank you.&quot;
Nalini and I caught up briefly with the Viharani before dinner, and chatted about what they and we had been doing, but most of the discussion had to wait until dinner.
They were all interested in our plans for the estate and the region, and offered to visit from time to time to see how things developed. The Viharani had a completely different society, with all members telepathic amongst themselves. Problems could rapidly be communicated to the council, but each individual and each settlement had a high degree of autonomy. Urgent problems would be solved by whoever was on the spot, non urgent ones could be discussed by those interested, regardless of whereabouts. They had few laws, relying instead on consensus interpretation of tradition, plus what seemed fair at the time. I think secretly they regarded most humans as stupid and primitive, because why else would they need such well-defined laws? Proper social behavior should be learned as a child; adults should know how to behave.
Durathror confessed to spending some time debating the puritans over morals and ethics, and had delighted in finding biblical quotations to contradict things they said that he didn't agree with. He also went through a number of ethical exercises that the Viharani used in teaching their children. The puritans wavered between defiant and ashamed that they did not perform as well as they expected.
Nalini, Prospero and I were wondering how king Charles would handle not being the center of attention, because none of us had any intention of kowtowing to him. However, most of the servants did behave obsequiously; he might not have been THE king, but he was a king and they encouraged him to made himself at home ordering the servants around.
At dinner I had to give a short speech of welcome, but I kept it informal. I wished them well, told them to make themselves at home, and if they wished for anything to let me know and we would try to obtain it for them. I pointed out that this wasn't the palace, and that our range of entertainment might be a little limited, but that everyone should try to relax and treat this as a holiday.
Charles made some remark about how the estate was delightfully rustic, and we did not always need all the comforts of the city.
Cromwell observed &quot;My lord king, I mistakenly believed that you savored the comforts of the palace, and that rustic life did not appeal.&quot;
Charles smiled cruelly &quot;Cromwell, In the past year we have seen precious little of the comforts of the court, or even those of a rustic manor. Thanks to your army, we have been hounded from pillar to post, and many is the time we have spent the night at some peasant's rude hut or shepherd's hovel. King Amrik's court is a different tenor from the one we keep, but enjoyable none the less. The past few days is the first opportunity we have had simply to relax and enjoy life, free from the worries of the crown, and free from the threats of your soldiers. Glittering balls and witty repartee have their place, but quiet conversation, card games or board games and the quiet rustic life also have their attractions. This estate may be rustic, but its facilities are the equal of those in our palaces in England. We intend to enjoy our stay here.&quot;
Nalini asked &quot;You majesty, it is a concern to us that you do enjoy your stay here, but we are unsure what that may require.&quot;
King Charles smiled at her. &quot;Contrary to what the puritans may say, we have simple tastes. Court life can be frenetic, almost everyone at court wants something from us, and we have very little privacy. Over the past year away from court we have been discovering what it means to be a private citizen, though much of that time has been spent in fear for our lives. Since arriving in Aquilonia we have been able to relax for the first time in many months. We intend to spent time doing what pleases us, free from regard for the desires of our courtiers. We believe there is much here that will interest us.&quot;
&quot;I'm glad of that. Are your rooms to your liking? Are the facilities up to what you expect?&quot;
&quot;We must confess they are much more palatial than many rooms in which we have stayed in recent months. The d_cor may not be quite as sumptuous as our palace, but the facilities are on par. We do not have...&quot; he paused, obviously searching for words &quot;piped water. Is there a word for that?&quot;
&quot;We use the word plumbing in English. It includes piped water, flushing toilets and so on.&quot;
The king nodded. &quot;England does not have plumbing, few manors even have internal toilets or kitchens. A special bathing room is quite unknown. We would say that the facilities of your manor are the equal of our palaces in England. King Amrik's palace in Tarantia has features we did not dream existed. We should like to install erà plumbing in our palaces when we return, and we have in mind to construct a special bath house and er... sauna.&quot;
Come to think of it, while our manor did not have piped water or flushing toilets in the rooms, there was a bath house and sauna, the kitchen did have piped water, albeit pumped by a horse powered pump into a tank, and the ground floor did have several flushing toilets. We could not install plumbing to the upper floors simply because the water tower was not high enough to give any water pressure. One of many things we intended to change in the near future.
Charles concluded &quot;When we said 'delightfully rustic' we implied no criticism.&quot;
Prospero asked &quot;Do any of you enjoy hunting? We have wild boar in the forest, and there are wild goats in the mountains. I would like to arrange a hunt if any of you would be interested in participating.&quot;
There were several takers including king Charles. It seemed that most of the nobles enjoyed hunting. They might not be so enthusiastic when they realized that Prospero meant with bow and arrow, not firearms.
Paula rolled her eyes and commented to Liz &quot;Men's business.&quot;
Liz replied &quot;There's nothing wrong with hunting, provided you eat what you kill&quot;
&quot;Oh, he does that. I'm just not that keen on killing things.&quot;
Prospero was enthusiastic. &quot;Good, I will arrange one for the next few days. There is also some good trout fishing in some of the streams here. We can provide the fishing gear, I realize most of you gentlemen won't have brought any with you.&quot;
Baron Laredo chuckled &quot;Marko and I did bring our fishing rods! We fully intend to do some trout fishing while we're here.&quot;
Prospero shot back &quot;No wonder you insisted they must travel in the steam ship. You wanted an excuse for some trout fishing!&quot;
&quot;Only partly true. My craftsmen have reworked the boiler and piping, I wanted to take the ship on a shakedown cruise. Tomorrow when she's cool Marko and I will strip down the boilers and inspect them for problems.&quot;
&quot;How did it go? How long did the journey take?&quot;
&quot;We left at dawn, we arrived at Arana not quite ten hours later. By my calculations we averaged about twenty four miles per hour for the entire journey.&quot;
There was almost a chorus of &quot;That's incredible!&quot; from the English.
Laredo continued &quot;We did not run at full power, we kept it under three quarters, so she will go faster yet. There are still some problems with the rudder, but the new bow design of yours means she cuts through the water much more easily.&quot;
&quot;So where is she now?&quot;
&quot;We put in at the naval docks, and now the marines have her under guard. The naval captains are very interested in the ship, I think we will have to give them a demonstration sometime in the next few days.&quot;
Prince Rupert commented &quot;I should like to attend that demonstration, I have not yet seen this steam boat sail.&quot;
Charles himself gave an enthusiastic response, forgetting the royal we in his excitement. &quot;Rupert, you would not believe! The steam ship is four times faster than any sailing ship! There is no paddle wheel as with the steamers our lord admiral has experimented with. The best he has managed is no more than twice the speed of a sailing ship. You must see it! I am sure we could build something similar.&quot;
Rupert nodded &quot;I believe their steel is superior to ours, your majesty, and they can run their boilers at higher pressure. However, I have seen how the ship is propelled. They have some large brass screw device that spins, I would wish to experiment with that when we return to England.&quot;
&quot;Good, good, it shall be so.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;There are actually two screws or propellers, and they rotate in opposite directions. We have found that a single one is less stable, and has more vibration.&quot;
&quot;What was that about the bow design?&quot; Rupert asked.
&quot;Oh, we found that the bow shape of a typical wooden sailing ship is too blunt for high speed. The boat tends to ram the waves. For a faster speed the bow must be sharp.&quot;
They got into a discussion about ship design, steam engine design and related topics that lasted half the night. We drew king Charles into a game of mahjong, and partnered him with Paula since the rules are complicated. He seemed quite pleased with himself. Prospero's mother sat and talked with the Viharani, several of the puritans including Cromwell wandered over to watch our game of mahjong.
Cromwell declared &quot;I am pleased to see it is not cards, nor is it gambling. Both are vices that lead to spiritual ruin.&quot;
Nalini observed mildly, &quot;But Cromwell, one can gamble on anything where the outcome is uncertain. You should not blame the game for people's vices.&quot;
Charles added &quot;The lady is right Cromwell. Cards need not be played for wagers. This game could certainly be betted upon.&quot;
&quot;Humph, then we should ban it in England!&quot;
&quot;On the contrary. It has complicated rules like bridge or whist, and takes skill to play. I for one should like to introduce this game to England.&quot; He picked up a tile.
Paula added &quot;We've been teaching Rupert to play, so there would be two of you at court who can play.&quot; She paused to confer in a whisper about the tiles in his hand. He selected one and discarded it.
I turned to Nalini. &lt;&lt;We should look for a nice mahjong set we can give him as a present.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Yes, but one where the rules are written in decent English. We should probably give a second one to Rupert.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;We'll add them to our shopping list.&gt;&gt;
With Paula's help, Charles won several games. The puritans could not be drawn into the game, but continued to stand around and watch.
Many things happened over the following five weeks. Nalini and I returned to Brisbane once, accompanied by Liz, Paula and Rupert. Durathror and Ra'anor guided us and did the shifting, which allowed us to move in large shifts and reach Brisbane in about half an hour instead of six hours. Rupert, naturally enough, was astonished by everything he saw.
Liz went to visit her parents, as did Paula, while Nalini and I checked on our business. Though we were now rich enough not to need to keep the business going, neither of us was yet ready to sell the business or close it down. Among other things, it provided us with an island of normality in a world that was becoming increasingly strange.
Rupert stayed with us for the day, as Liz said she was not ready to introduce him to her parents. I think part of it may have been that she was too embarrassed to introduce him. We had told Rupert she was Nalini's cousin the Lady Elizabeth, we needed to explain away that little white lie before introducing him to an ordinary couple living in an ordinary suburban house. He also needed some schooling in how to behave in our society. Nalini and I even joked with Rupert that it wouldn't do for him to go around calling Liz &quot;My fair lady&quot;.  We stayed there one night, which was long enough to give Rupert a brief tour, then Nalini, Durathror and I departed for Nalini's home shadow to visit her parents. To avoid shocking them, we went first to Nalini's shadow Brisbane, where she telephoned them to say we were dropping in for a quick visit. The distance from Brisbane to Sydney where her parents live is about twelve hundred kilometers, but travelling through shadow with Durathror meant we covered the distance in about twenty minutes. He left us at Nalini's apartment, saying he would return the next morning. We cleaned the apartment, checked her email, and then caught a taxi to Nalini's parents. Nalini's car was currently in our garage in my shadow Brisbane; normally we drive through shadow from there to her shadow Sydney.
They are always very happy to see her, although to them she is something of the black sheep of the family. Her father is a diplomat, her mother a doctor. Nalini is the eldest child, and the only one not to be officially married and the only one not to have given them grand children. She also dropped out of medical school and took off travelling, disappearing for several years. They know nothing of shadows or shadow shifting, as far as they are concerned we are based in Brisbane, but spend much of our time travelling the world for our work. Nalini has even hinted that we are some sort of government agents trouble shooting world problems. We hadn't intended to tell them that, but they came around one day to clean her apartment and discovered the pistols in their box in the wardrobe, and a set of false ids for another shadow.
Nalini's mother had asked &quot;Nalini, who is Angela Quek?&quot; referring to the name on Nalini's false id.
&quot;Oh mother!&quot; Nalini had replied. &quot;You've been prying!&quot;
Telling them we were government agents seemed the easiest way, forestalling questions about what we did. If we made things up we'd trip up. Nalini's father was more understanding. He concurred that such work wasn't normally dangerous, but false ids were needed to ensure agents could not be traced back to their real identities.
Nalini's mother had protested &quot;But you could have been a doctor Nalini! A respected job, good income, and you'd be here in Sydney.&quot;
&quot;If I were a doctor, I'd want to work in third world countries and do some good for people. And that is dangerous!&quot;
Oddly enough they regard me as some sort of stabilizing influence, but I think they have watched her blossom since she met me.
This time we had some good news for them, we had set a date for our wedding. They were delighted at that. We also had to warn them that some of our guests would be a little odd.
&quot;What do you mean by odd?&quot;
&quot;Some will be from foreign countries and they don't speak English or they speak it badly.&quot;
&quot;But that isn't odd. There are still a number of countries where they don't speak English.&quot; Nalini's father responded. &quot;Would any of them perhaps be from a country you have helped recently?&quot;
We both smiled at that. I responded &quot;We can't really say, but it might be possible that there may be people from a certain country which is moving toward Westminster style democracy. Of course, it would be nothing official, and the country might not like to admit that it has outside advisorsà&quot; I let things trail off, knowing that Nalini's father would draw his own conclusions.
Her father smiled knowingly. &quot;There are a number of countries in that position. They want the benefits of the British Empire, but publicly they must revile us as oppressive overlords. One wrong word leaked could damage their political credibility at home. Just let us know if they have any special requirements, such as special foods and so on, and whether they can't be seated near one another. You can trust us to behave with the utmost discretion.&quot;
Nalini laughed softly. &quot;I know I can trust you and mother, but it's the other relatives that could talk.&quot;
We stayed late into the evening, and Nalini's brother and sister dropped in for dinner, with their spouses and children.
The wedding did present some logistic problems. There would be a Viharani contingent and an Aquilonian contingent. Both those parties knew about shadow shifting, and would not present a problem. But there was my family to consider. If we invited them someone would have to bring them, and then there would be no way to keep the secret of shadows quiet. We had a reluctance to publicize this, we both felt the governments of our respective shadows would want to investigate us if they knew about us, and we preferred to avoid that. Well, something to think about and resolve over the next few months. If they knew about shadows, some things would be simpler.
While we went to two shadow earths, Prospero organized his hunt with the rest of the nobles who were our guests. They caught several animals, probably wild boar and goat, but Nalini and I weren't that interested. He also taught the English the joys of trout fishing, and seemed to have made a number of conversions, including both Charles and Cromwell. As Prospero remarked, they finally had something in common.
Charles and Cromwell also had a number of talk sessions moderated by Prospero and Durathror. Nalini and I attended some but lost interest in the proceedings. Some issues were resolved, while some weren't. Prospero finally lost patience and decreed that he would set the solution, whether they liked it or not. That solution would be based on what Aquilonia had decided to do in similar circumstances. Otherwise he and I would act as judges, and make an equitable judgement. I wondered how well it would work.
It was late summer here in Aquilonia, so the farm was busy with harvest time. The cherries had been and gone, the pears were ripe, the apples ripening, as were the plums, peaches and apricots. We had intended to head home after three weeks, but two things intervened. The first was the harvest; the second was preparations for returning the English to their home shadow.
Each fruit ripens at a slightly different date from the others, so one week might be spent harvesting apricots, the next peaches, and then plums. Later would be the grapes, the apples, the corn and the walnuts.
When a fruit is in season you tend to gorge on that fruit. Some is preserved as jam, cooked with sugar and bottled, or drowned in brandy and bottled, while some is converted into wine. Some of that wine is then distilled into brandy. We supervised the making of apricot wine, peach wine and plum wine, plus of course the grape harvest which is almost entirely intended for wine making. Some of the apples would be converted into cider. The grape wines were by far the greatest quantity, and were destined for sale, though we would retain a few barrels. The fruit wines and brandies were almost entirely for consumption by the estate.
In about six to eight weeks after starting the wines, the estate would commence distilling part of the wine to make brandy. For those of you who have never tasted them, brandies made from fruit are quite delightful. Our estate made cherry brandy, peach brandy, apricot brandy, pear brandy, plum brandy, apple brandy, and grape brandy. Some of the brandy from the previous year is used to preserve some of the current fruit harvest. As I have said before, the estate is a working estate, and is largely self-sufficient.
One little treat during harvest season is to pick fresh corncobs and barbecue them. There is also much drinking done to fortify the fruit pickers, who then proceed to sing harvest songs while they work. Harvest time is almost one long party.
Nalini and I took part in the harvest. The first time, Maraldo protested &quot;But lord, we have sufficient workers, there is no need for you to work.&quot;
I smiled at him &quot;Maraldo, my parents have fruit trees, I have always helped to pick fruit each harvest season. Why should this one be any different? Just find us some baskets, and we'll help out.&quot;
His expression said I wasn't behaving how he expected, but he fetched some baskets. &quot;I'm afraid we don't have another ladder sir.&quot;
&quot;I see. We'll just have to make do then.&quot;
Durathror laughed, picked up a basket and floated into the air. &quot;We Viharani have no need for ladders!&quot;
And so Durathror, Ra'anor, Imladril, Iskandor, Liz and Paula all joined Nalini and I in harvesting the fruits of our estate. Prospero and Rupert stood around watching us and offering comment. That surprised me a little, because Prospero has helped back home.
Paula commented &quot;In Brisbane he's one of the boys, here he's a lord and he tries to behave the right way.&quot;
&quot;Hey Prospero, you're missing out on the fun!&quot;
&quot;My fun is in watching you clamber over those trees, and in eating the fruit you pick!&quot; He was munching on an apricot as he spoke. &quot;These are good!&quot;
A little later the English came into the orchard to observe. King Charles made a remark about how wonderful harvest time was back in England, and how he enjoyed seeing trees full of ripe fruit. Then he spotted Durathror floating around a tree, picking fruit from the top most branches. &quot;Prince Durathror, how in heaven's name are you floating in the air?&quot;
&quot;It is a simple application of natural laws your majesty. Everyone knows that birds fly because they have wings, but few people know that the muscles at the rear of the shoulders are part of that power. With diligent practice it is possible to use one's shoulder muscles to generate enough lifting force to enable one to float in the air like this.&quot;
&quot;Really? We think it should be fun to fly! Could you teach us, Prince Durathror?&quot;
&quot;Assuredly your majesty, though it may take many years before you can gain the strength. We can start soon if you would like.&quot;
Nalini and I had a little trouble keeping a straight face, but Durathror carried it off convincingly.
The English walked around in groups of twos and threes, inspecting what we were doing, and sampling the fruit from baskets the workers brought to the horse drawn carts.
Cromwell walked over to the tree where Nalini and I were working. &quot;It is a joy to behold god's bounty. You have a considerable orchard here lord Daniel.&quot;
&quot;We do, but it must feed everyone on the estate, and we have at least fifty workers plus their families, and the platoon of soldiers.&quot;
He watched us picking fruit in silence, then stated &quot;I might add it is a joy to behold a lord working up an honest sweat toiling in his fields.&quot; He was smiling.
&quot;Do you mean that most lords work up a dishonest sweat over their money boxes?&quot; I quipped in return. &quot;Nalini and I have a simple outlook on life- anyone who is too good to work doesn't need to eat. I have done this since I was a child, I enjoy helping out at harvest time. And it gives me a good feeling when I eat to be able to look at the food and know that I helped it grow.&quot;
&quot;It is a good philosophy, we should never forget our roots. I too have an estate back in England, and I enjoy helping with the harvest. We do not have the variety of fruit that you seem to be able to grow here. May I help?&quot;
&quot;Sure. You'll notice that there are two sets of baskets. The good fruit goes in one set, that we'll eat or preserve. The squashy or damaged fruit goes in the other set; they will be used to make apricot wine and apricot brandy.&quot;
He began to pick fruit. When two baskets filled up, I grabbed them and took them over to the horse drawn cart. When I returned, Prospero picked up two more baskets and took them away. With several people picking, baskets fill rapidly, and we needed people to take time out to empty them. Prospero and I took it in turns to empty the baskets were we were working. Rupert seemed to feel guilty standing around, and wandered over to where Liz and Paula were working.
As I said, you tend to gorge on one variety of fruit for a week or so before the next variety is ready. By that time you are almost sick of eating the same fruit, and are waiting eagerly for the next. We were there for the apricots, plums, peaches and grapes.
Amrik and Enyil arrived in time for the grape harvest. Some of the grapes would be for eating, but most were destined for wine making. Since wine was a product we sold, this was a fairly large operation. Amrik walked around the fields for an hour or so, carrying buckets of grapes back to the carts, then he took a turn at the crushing. I should point out that in Aquilonia we do not crush grapes by stamping on them, instead there is a machine with a series of large rollers inside that are turned to squash the grapes into the vats. Two horses that walk in circles around a central pivot supply motive power for the rollers; in other words the crusher is a two horse power unit. Men are needed to carry buckets of grapes from the carts to the top of the crusher, the buckets are heavy, and there are steps. I think many farm workers were shocked to see their king carrying buckets of grapes like a common laborer, but that was one characteristic that endeared him to his people.
Until then I think some of the workers had been uneasy about the nobles helping out. Amrik became involved in a drinking contest with the men crushing the grapes. They would drink a small glass of brandy after each cart was emptied into the crusher. With Amrik helping to carry the grapes the carts were unloaded faster, and they drank more. By the time we broke for lunch, two of the workers were roaring drunk, leaning their arms around Amrik's neck in order to stand, and all three were singing bawdy songs at the top of their voices.
Maraldo sought me out. &quot;Sir, what should I do? The two should be disciplined for drinking so much, but they could easily claim the king encouraged them.&quot;
&quot;I would let them off this time, as you said, they were drinking with the king. But if they get drunk tomorrow they should be disciplined.&quot;
The manager had arranged for a number of tables to be set up in the shade of the winery building. We appropriated one and ate whatever food was provided to the workers. I think Wilomo and the kitchen staff may have cringed at the thought, and it is possible that better food had been prepared for us. However, I was trying to set the precedent that everyone on the estate works, and that all people should be treated equally. Amrik in his own inimitable way was doing the same.
Amrik was no where near as drunk as he seemed. When he joined us for lunch, his speech was slightly slurred, but otherwise he seemed none the worse for the drink.
&quot;I haven't done that for ages!&quot; he enthused.
&quot;And hopefully you won't need to drink so much for ages again.&quot; Enyil chided gently.
&quot;Hah! You have to drink at the grape harvest! I haven't been to one since my family was killed.&quot; He looked a little sad. &quot;Enyil, as king I cannot do these things, surely here amongst my friends I can drink a little while we harvest grapes.&quot;
&quot;Of course Amrik, my love. But it would sadden me if you were to become as drunk as those workers, and I thought you were that drunk.&quot; She indicated the two, who were now sitting in the shade, too drunk to stand.
&quot;Now, it would take a lot to make me legless. The only time I have done that was the night we captured Sorono, and everyone was celebrating. You have never seen me more than slightly merry. I shan't drink more than I have.&quot;
He was true to his word, in his own way. At lunch he drank only water, but one incident caused him to revert briefly to wine mixed with water.
A young mother was sitting at one of the tables, and began feeding her baby. None of the Aquilonians seemed to notice, though several of the puritans stared and passed remarks.
Nalini turned to Cromwell and commented acidly &quot;Cromwell, it may surprise you, but this is what god designed a woman's breasts for. They are not sexual playthings for men, they are for feeding babies. Shame on you for being offended at god's handiwork, or are you filled with lustful thoughts at the sight of a young female breast?&quot;
He spluttered and turned red. She continued &quot;If you have lustful thoughts lord Cromwell, I'm afraid that is your problem, you must learn self control. If god's handiwork offends, then you are a sorry case and are not fit to be a spiritual leader.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Don't look then.&quot;
He looked mightily offended, but managed to respond calmly &quot;I apologize lady Nalini. We are offended at such a sight. As you say, this is their natural function, perhaps we should not be so offended, though I would prefer that she did not sit at the table, but somewhere else.&quot;
&quot;You puritans have a problem with bodily functions, Lord Cromwell. God designed our bodies as they are&quot; they became embroiled in a discussion about why puritans thought the human body sinful and dirty.
Sir Mark Fairfax, the Scottish puritan general, and Baron Henry Shelley, one of the English parliamentarians, were expressing disgust for the sight, when Amrik strolled up and clapped both of them on the shoulder. Taller than both of them, he forcibly turned them around. He shifted his grip, then his muscles bulged under his shirt, and he lifted both men from their feet, forcing his face close to theirs. &quot;One more peep from either of you black birds of ill omen and I will bash your heads together, is that clear?&quot;
They nodded wordlessly. He set them down again, dusted his hands against their jackets. He grinned an evil grin. &quot;Then to show there is no ill will, come and drink with me.&quot;
Sir Mark shook his head. &quot;I'm sorry your majesty, I do not drink.&quot;
&quot;Which explains why you have such a sour disposition. That was not a request.&quot; He finished flatly &quot;You will drink with me now.&quot; 
He clapped a hand on each one's shoulder, propelled them to his table. He called for a jug of wine and beer steins then poured each of them a large measure of wine. Enyil handed him a stein which we later learned was half full of water. He sloshed wine into his stein, then sculled the lot.
&quot;Now, drink up!&quot; he encouraged the two. They pulled faces, but drank. He refilled their tankards while Enyil grabbed his, poured water, then when he relinquished the jug, topped up his tankard for him. He sculled his again, and encouraged the others. The last of the wine he split between their two tankards. Enyil poured water into his. He sculled his water, set the empty tankard down with satisfaction. 
&quot;Ah! An honest day's toil makes a man thirsty! Don't you feel better now?&quot;
Henry said sourly &quot;I think I feel sick.&quot;
&quot;Nonsense lad, you've drunk scarcely two glasses. A strapping lad like you should be able to handle that much wine with no problems at all.&quot;
The effect of a bit more than a bottle of wine each on the two puritans was almost comical. After about fifteen minutes they were slurring their words, and having trouble standing. Neither of them was sick, there wasn't sufficient wine for that, but after half an hour, both of them were asleep at the table.
At our table, Cromwell was waxing lyrical about cleanliness, and how the human body was filth, and sinful. Nalini interrupted &quot;If you are so sure that you need to be clean, why then do you puritans have so much trouble with washing yourselves?&quot;
I added &quot;We find the rancid odor of unwashed bodies quite offensive.&quot;
Matthew stated &quot;We find your bath houses offensive.&quot;
&quot;Why so?&quot; Nalini asked.
&quot;You can always order hot water brought to your rooms.&quot; I added.
&quot;I believe we are used to England, where there is no need to wash daily.&quot; Cromwell replied.
Matthew commented &quot;There are naked women in the bath house!&quot;
&quot;Why is it so hard to wash daily? Why must you leave it until you are so dirty you stink?&quot;
Cromwell nodded &quot;I must agree with you, lady Nalini. We should wash daily; warmed water does make the task more pleasant. But we will not use your public bath house.&quot;
&quot;Do you find the sight of a naked female offensive, or does it arouse lustful thoughts?&quot; Nalini asked both of them.
&quot;It is offensive to behold human nakedness!&quot; Matthew stated forthrightly.
&quot;And the sight might arouse lustful thoughts in the younger men.&quot; Cromwell added.
&quot;Why do you find the human body so offensive? We are made in god's own image, do you find god's image and god's handiwork offensive?&quot; Nalini pressed.
&quot;But lady Nalini, god himself has directed us that we must cover our nakedness. Why, there is the case of the punishment he meted out to Noah's son when he looked upon his father's nakedness.&quot;
I held up my hand &quot;Lord Cromwell, that is the old testament, you and Matthew were going to work through the old testament and determine what pronouncements pertained to the old covenant and which pertained to the new. But no one is suggesting public nakedness, merely while you are performing your ablutions.&quot;
&quot;But others may gaze upon one's nakedness!&quot; Matthew protested. Cromwell seconded that.
Nalini snorted derisively &quot;No one is likely to want to gaze at your nakedness Cromwell. Aquilonians will ignore you. But you will have to do the same, and not gaze at others who are naked. If you can't control yourselves, then you should stay away from a public bathhouse.&quot;
&quot;We have no intention of ever venturing inside one!&quot; Cromwell stated primly.
&quot;Well, no one would stop you, lord Cromwell, but perhaps we should explain the etiquette to both of you. Firstly, there are disrobing rooms, and they are segregated. Most people do not take valuables into a bathhouse, they wear a bathing robe, and bring another clean one for after. If you do bring valuables, you can leave them with an attendant. You undress in the disrobing room, and take your towel and a wash cloth with you into the main bathing room. Many people do arrange to drape their towel strategically across their fronts so that their bodies are partially obscured.&quot;
They were both silent, listening. &quot;Secondly, inside the bathing room, you will find wooden stools and wooden buckets arranged around the walls. Etiquette demands that you do not stare at other people. There are attendants there who ensure that the buckets are filled with water, and can assist you if you are elderly and cannot bend easily.&quot;
Both men made faces. Nalini responded &quot;Suppose you had arthritis, lord Cromwell, how then would you wash yourself properly? You would need help to wash those areas you could not reach.&quot; The thought did not seem to please him.
&quot;When you wash yourselves, you sit on the stool facing the wall.&quot; I continued. &quot;You will find that the men use one side of the room, and the women use the other side. When you wash yourself, you use the dipper to splash water over your body or wet your washcloth, you don't place your cloth or hands into the buckets. You soap yourself, wash with your wash cloth, and rinse the soap off using the dipper. There should always be two buckets, one with hot water, and one with cold water, and usually you finish the washing process by splashing cold water over yourself. The attendant can hold a bucket for you while you wash your hair, and pour water over your head to rinse the soap off. Once you are clean, you can towel yourself dry, and go.&quot;
&quot;That is all?&quot; Cromwell asked.
Matthew added &quot;You mean there are no licentious acts taking place?&quot; he sounded almost disappointed.
&quot;There is nothing of a sexual nature taking place.&quot; Nalini replied. &quot;A bath house is for bathing. Once you have washed yourself, you can go home, or you can use one of the pools or the sauna.&quot;
&quot;And they are communal are they not?&quot;
&quot;Lord Cromwell, people take towels with them.&quot; I replied. &quot;In the sauna most people will cover their genitals with a towel. Many people will cover themselves with a towel until they get into the water, and there is quite an art in keeping the towel in place but removing it as you enter the water so the towel does not become wet.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;There is a hot pool, a tepid pool and a cold pool. Normally you would start with the hot pool, move to the tepid one, then to the cold one. Some sauna users will plunge directly into the cold pool, but that can cause headaches. They should always enter a pool feet first, so there isn't a shock to the brain.&quot;
&quot;Oh&quot; Cromwell said thoughtfully &quot;you are sure nothing lewd or lascivious happens?&quot;
&quot;Nothing lord Cromwell.&quot;
&quot;And let me remind you that you are not supposed to stare at other people.&quot; I added. &quot;Of course, if your puritans have trouble with lustful thoughts, then it would be better that you stay away from the public bathhouse.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;In the city the public baths are full almost all day, but here they are empty almost all day. Before we arrived, the water wasn't even heated until the afternoon, but now it will be hot by noon. If we work out we will bathe afterwards; we normally bathe before dinner, but most of the staff will not bath until after nine in the evening, when their duties have finished. If you pick your time, you can find the baths deserted.&quot;
&quot;You do make them seem quite innocuous.&quot; Cromwell replied. &quot;But we shall not venture in there.&quot;
&quot;Cromwell, essentially it's a working solution to the problem of keeping the public clean. Heating quantities of water for bathing is best done in large tubs, and the bathhouses provide the entire infrastructure for keeping yourself clean. Let's face it, most of the English stink because bathing is such a chore. A public bathhouse makes it much easier.&quot;
Cromwell replied thoughtfully. &quot;When you explain things, it does seem like a reasonable solution. However, I would prefer completely segregated bathing. But I suppose that would entail either duplicate pools, or setting different times for men and women to bathe, and neither may be practical.&quot;
&quot;Cromwell, you've missed an important point. The public bathing isn't a problem, it's an individual's attitudes to it that determine whether he or she commits a sin when they bathe in public. As I explained, a bathhouse is not a place for lust, but if an individual has trouble with lustful thoughts then they should stay away.&quot;
Nalini giggled &quot;A bucket of cold water might fix most of them!&quot;
Cromwell managed a smile, though he might have just been polite. &quot;You are right of course, a person's attitude is the main factor that determines whether something is sinful. Perhaps we English are more troubled by sinful thoughts than you Aquilonians.&quot;
Nalini had the last word &quot;It could be simply that England being a cold climate, you are always dressed in lots of clothes. So a tradition has grown up from ignorance that bathing causes disease, and that naked bodies are sinful of their own nature. A lot of Europeans come from warmer climes, they are less concerned about the sight of naked flesh.&quot;
No, we didn't mention the fact that some of the more northern countries like Sweden and Denmark also indulged in public saunas.
After the grape harvest, Maraldo and Katerina were married, and moved together into the newly built manager's cottage. We gave some gifts, but tried to stay out of the limelight during the wedding, after all, this was their night, not ours. Wilomo made some demurral, but Amrik settled it by declaring he would not attend unless he was given a table amongst the rest of the guests.
While Wilomo would argue with Nalini and I about how something should be done, he didn't dare argue with king Amrik. And so, Maraldo and Katerina numbered King Amrik amongst their guests, and Amrik danced with the bride on her wedding night.
Amrik also presided over the final negotiations between king Charles and Cromwell, and wanted a briefing on what they had agreed.
The final result of the negotiations was that king Charles and Cromwell made concessions. Each house could introduce laws, or veto them, as could the king. The analogy that Prospero used was that of a stool with three legs. There was to be one law for all, with the lords and the king subject to the law like everyone else. Certain basic rights were guaranteed by the king, as part of his sacred trust to the people. The rights included freedom of religion, guarantee of land tenure, minimum wages for workers. The puritans were not happy about the guarantee of religious freedom, until Amrik told them bluntly that he'd have them strung up for treason unless they cooperated. Cromwell saw the light of reason and capitulated on this.
The death sentence and the outlawry on the king were to be rescinded. The witch persecution would be dismantled. All lands and property confiscated were to be returned to their rightful owners, or their heirs. Where this was impossible, some form of compensation would be worked out, and would also be worked out for each execution. Cromwell seemed to have no trouble agreeing to that, maintaining all the while he was loyal to his king, and merely wished to stop the civil war. It was likely that he planned to renege once he was back in England.
There were a lot of lesser items and some cross guarantees that would see Cromwell as the parliamentary leader for five years, but with the promise to work closely with the king to ensure that the reforms they'd jointly agreed to were implemented. The electoral system would also be reformed to ensure greater 
I wouldn't say that Cromwell and king Charles were friends, but they had a working relationship. We all knew there would be some fine-tuning on the ground, but there would be an Aquilonian embassy in London, along with several Viharani to monitor proceedings and ensure that things did not get out of hand.
With that settled, it was time to return the puritans and king Charles to England.

            <Text>Chapter 9
We were quite a large party. There was Nalini and myself, Paula and Liz, Prospero and king Amrik, King Charles and his three cavaliers, Prince Rupert, Cromwell and the six puritans, Imladril, Iskandor, Durathror, Ra'anor, Enyil, Atlendor and his friend Perashil, like all the Viharani dark skinned and blonde haired, but with yellow eyes instead of green. We were escorted by a fifty of the king's palace guard, the elite of the elite. All of us were mounted on horseback. Durathror and Iskandor rode at the head of the column, the rest of the Viharani were distributed through the column. Nalini and I could relax and enjoy the ride instead of trying to shift shadows.
We were expecting an incident free trip, but things don't always work out that way.
The first we knew of trouble was the sound of cannon fire in the distance, followed by much closer explosions. Durathror had us halt, then a few of us rode ahead. He wanted just himself and Iskandor, but Amrik, Prospero and myself insisted on accompanying him. A few others followed us, including Cromwell and prince Rupert.
We rode to the edge of the forest, to a point where we could see what was happening. The forest was on the side of the hill, and ended abruptly, giving way to stony farmland. Ahead was a saddle of mountains, nestled underneath was a village about one hundred meters distant. Down in the valley were six large tanks and a small squad of bearded, khaki clad soldiers. As we watched, there was a puff of smoke from the turret gun of one of the tanks, followed by a loud explosion in the village. There was a column of frightened villagers heading toward the forest and us. It was obvious that many of them were wounded.
Amrik spat out an oath, his face grim. &quot;We must stop this!&quot;
&quot;Yes&quot; Durathror's face was hard.
Another explosion shook the hillside, this time from some distance below the skein of fleeing villagers, making it obvious the soldiers in the tanks were targeting them.
Cromwell spoke in surprise &quot;They are killing the villagers!&quot;
&quot;They are.&quot; Durathror had a far-away look on his face. He did not speak for a moment, then exclaimed &quot;I have them!&quot; Three rocket launchers and nine rockets appeared at his feet. He and Iskandor began loading a launcher each. &quot;This is what human warfare comes to, lord Cromwell. Soldiers in armored mobile canons women and children.&quot;
I leaped from my horse to use the third launcher, but Amrik beat me to it. At Durathror's look, he replied &quot;I have used one of these before.&quot; referring to the events surrounding the time we had rescued him and Prospero. [*See Shadow of the Serpent] He slid the rocket into its tube, shouldered the launcher, and flicked off the safety.
Durathror commented &quot;Then king Amrik, do you aim at the rearmost tank. Iskandor, take the one to its left&quot; He put his eye to the sighting scope, and pressed the stud. The rocket made two pings indicating it had acquired a target. The others' rockets made similar noises.
&quot;Fire&quot; Durathror commanded softly. Three trails of fire sped swiftly toward the tanks, followed by tremendous explosions. The three stooped to reload their launchers. When the smoke cleared, three of the tanks had disappeared, leaving large craters with flames pouring from them. Two more had been thrown on their sides. The last tank was swinging its turret gun around to target us. The three fired again, targeting the remaining tanks.
This time we heard ragged cheers from the villagers. We had to wait for the smoke to clear before we could assess the situation. Many of the soldiers accompanying the tanks had been killed or injured in the explosions, but a few still stood, though they looked dazed.
Durathror turned. &quot;We must see to the soldiers. Friend Amrik, keep an eye on things, and use the rockets if any more mobile canons appear.&quot; He, Atlendor and Iskandor set off down the slope and within five meters all were completely invisible.
Amrik shook his head, a look of grim satisfaction on his face.&quot;Those butchers received no more than was their due! But this kind of warfare is unclean. I like it not.&quot;
Cromwell remarked soberly &quot;You are right your majesty. This is devil's work.&quot;
Imladril rode up and dismounted. &quot;Nalini, we must see to the wounded. Danny, perhaps you and Prospero can come with us. But we must keep a watchful eye here lest those attackers have reinforcements. King Amrik, I am afraid your soldiers will be little use against such weapons, but you could use them to post a guard, and likely they will be needed to dig graves. This is a dangerous situation, I would be happier if we could move everyone somewhere safer.&quot;
Amrik nodded grimly. &quot;Your majesty, a soldier puts his life on the line to defend his country and his people. We will guard you as best we can, and dig graves. But those scum we destroyed are not soldiers, but common murderers.&quot; As we left, he was explaining to Rupert and Paula how to use the other two launchers.
There were perhaps a hundred villagers, many of them injured by shrapnel or burns. Some were missing body parts, or had other horrific injuries, these were the first to be dealt with. For many of the injured, time was critical, they could die if left untreated for long.
Imladril, Enyil, Perashil and Ra'anor are all accomplished sorcerers. They used their sorcery to heal the injured, with miraculous results. They worked independently, each using some form of shape shifting sorcery. For example, Imladril would briefly run her hands through the injured person's aura, then exert her powers to reform the injured person's physical body in accordance with the shape the aura encoded. To the eye, the injured person's form would flicker several times, then return to focus as the uninjured person. Of course, performing this healing requires much energy, and is tiring on the healer.
They worked swiftly, and had treated all the villagers within fifteen minutes. The villagers had been in shock, now many of them were dancing with delight and disbelief. Several told us that old existing ailments had gone. Some referred to Imladril as &quot;the blessed virgin&quot;, though Imladril tried to explain she was no virgin. Ra'anor told them we were elves.
The villagers themselves were light skinned, dark haired Europeans. They spoke a language I tagged as Slavic since it reminded me of Polish, but I could not recognize it. We conversed using the translation spell, which operates via a modified form of telepathy.
There were very few men of military age in the group, they were mostly women and children and old people. There seemed to be some sort of civil war going on here; while I have little knowledge of the reasons behind it, my sympathies lie with the civilians who suffer at the hands of the soldiers.
Amrik and a number of the others joined us before we had finished. He was carrying his rocket launcher over his shoulder, and his sword was belted to his waist. &quot;How goes it?&quot;
&quot;Many of them were badly injured, they will all live. But we should check the village itself to make sure no one is trapped in the rubble.&quot; Nalini responded. I checked his launcher to ensure it was set to safe then checked those of Rupert and Paula.
Durathror and Atlendor returned soon after, seeming to appear from nowhere. Durathror stated flatly &quot;The soldiers are dead.&quot;
&quot;All of them?&quot; Cromwell asked.
&quot;All. They are murderers all, they do not deserve to live!&quot; Durathror stated emphatically.
Amrik agreed. &quot;The army is to protect civilians, not make war on them. Death is a risk for any soldier, but these have forfeited any right to be called soldiers. They are nothing more than brigands! Faugh!&quot; he hawked and spat on the ground.
Durathror commented &quot;We found five more mobile cannons in the next valley, and more soldiers. They bear the device of a white five-pointed star within a circle. Do any of you recognize it?&quot;
Nalini and I looked at one another. &quot;It could be some communist emblem from our shadow, but surely this isn't that?&quot;
Cromwell ventured &quot;Do not witches use a five pointed star to symbolize their devil?&quot;
Amrik asked &quot;What of the other cannon?&quot;
&quot;Oh, we destroyed them all. They are rusted beyond recognition.&quot; He sighed &quot;We are heading toward the English civil war. It seems there are echoes in other shadows. We must proceed with caution from here on.&quot;
Imladril called across to him &quot;Brother, we should check the village. There may be people trapped in the ruins!&quot;
The villagers were over their initial joy at rescue, and were now sadly mourning those they had lost. We led them to the ruins of their village.
The houses had been built from stone and wood, and painted white. Now many of them stood like the stumps of broken teeth along the gravel road that ran through the village. Fires blazed in many, while others had every window shattered. There were about thirty or forty dead bodies, though it was hard to count them. Some of them were children. One headless little girl still clutched a doll, now smeared with blood. Others were less pretty, bloodied and broken body parts spread about, and blood and shit splattered everywhere.
Liz buried her head against Rupert and sobbed. Cromwell stood there with tears in his eyes. King Charles looked around in disbelief and shock, then vomited. Durathror commented flatly &quot;This is where your warfare leads, lord Cromwell, king Charles. Innocent civilians suffer.&quot;
We spent an hour sifting through the rubble, finding three survivors whom Imladril healed. Amrik showed several people how to use the rocket launchers, and left them with the villagers. Amrik also drafted our escort into grave digging. Hardened soldiers though they were, none was unaffected. We helped the villagers bury their dead, and then we left. They were collecting meager belongings in preparation for fleeing. Atlendor pointed out which direction would be safe. There was little else we could do.
We shifted twice, when Durathror held up his hand for silence. Somewhere off to the side we could hear screams and coarse laughter. &quot;Stay here. We will investigate.&quot; He slid down from his horse. Iskandor and Atlendor followed.
Amrik made to follow, but Atlendor shook his head. &quot;You are too noisy for this.&quot; They melted into the forest.
Amrik commented &quot;I can see now why they did not want me with them. I am good, but even I cannot vanish like that!&quot;
We waited in silence for five or ten minutes, whereupon Imladril announced &quot;They need us. Follow me.&quot;
She led us through the dense forest onto another trail, and thence to a clearing. At first sight there appeared to be lots of bodies lying about, some soldiers and some civilians. Most of the civilians were naked and had been mutilated. Some were obviously dead, but were hideously disfigured, with eyes gouged out, tongues torn out, bits of body missing, and carvings into their flesh. The dead were elderly or middle aged, the living were all female, and young. Some were not even at puberty. Many of the living were also mutilated, and it seemed obvious that they had been savagely raped and bashed. Imladril and Enyil flew from their horses to assist the injured.
The soldiers were all lying in a heap, jerking spasmodically as if being electrocuted. Most were either without trousers, or with their trousers around their ankles. Amrik took in the scene then stormed toward the soldiers, his fists clenched. &quot;Death is too good for them!&quot;
Durathror stopped him. &quot;Correct, Amrik. Do nothing to them. Their punishment will be that they shall do to each other what they did to their victims.&quot;
He turned and stalked back along the trail. The so-called soldiers staggered after him, carrying their rifles and knives. Prospero, Amrik and I fell in behind them. We walked for several hundred meters till we reached a cleared area where two military trucks and an armored jeep were parked. There was no one there, but it appeared that this was how the soldiers had brought their victims to this place.
Even as we stood around, the soldiers stripped off their clothes and began fighting amongst one another. Several used clawed fingers to gouge the eyes out of the others. Durathror commented &quot;Those who gouged eyes will have their eyes gouged out. What ever they did, one of their companions will do that to them.&quot; Some used knives to sever one another's tongues and other body parts, including penises. A few savagely beat others into submission with their rifle buts, then proceeded to anally rape them, sometimes with rifle barrels if they had lost their penises.
Durathror commented &quot;The spell will last for about five hours. They will not kill one another, but they will not cease until then. None will die, their wounds will crust over rapidly enough to prevent too much blood loss.&quot;
&quot;What's he carving?&quot; Amrik asked. One soldier was carefully carving words into the chest of his comrade, who screamed and roared in pain, but was powerless to stop it.
&quot;In his own language, the words read 'I did this to children.' They will live, they will recover, and they will live with the shame for the rest of their lives. Let us leave them to their pleasures.&quot; Their screams of agony followed us down the trail.
By the time we returned, the living were healed and clothed, but not comforted. They told us the soldiers had come into their village earlier and rounded them all up at gunpoint, driven them here, and then proceeded to rape and torture all of them.
Imladril spoke to the rest of us. &quot;To fix this we must destroy the entire attacking army, and then we must also destroy their rulers who let things come to this. We are not gods, this is beyond us. We cannot leave them here, and I do not even know where we can take them that is safe, since they do not know. It would be terrible if this were to happen again tomorrow.&quot;
Imladril probed their minds, and discovered that safety lay across the border in another country some two hundred miles away. They knew the direction.
Durathror turned to Imladril &quot;Sister, I think it best we take them there. Give me leave to scout out the place.&quot; He walked over to a large tree, and sat with his back against it. His eyes closed.
Cromwell nudged me. &quot;What is he doing?&quot; His visage was sickly, like a man who has looked on horror he did not know existed.
&quot;He is sending his spirit to scout out this land, and discover a place of safety for these villagers. We cannot leave them here, and we cannot return them to their village.&quot;
After about ten minutes, his body became limned in rainbow light, then winked out. Several of the rescued villagers gasped in astonishment.
Imladril turned to the villagers, saying &quot;We must go now, and take you to a place of safety. The rest of you please stay here.&quot; Enyil, Perashil, Ra'anor, Nalini and I gathered the villagers together. I had two teenage girls by the hand. Suddenly a rainbow doorway appeared to open before us, shimmering like a gossamer veil. Durathror stood on the other side. Imladril walked though, and the rest of us followed. A little way away there were parked trucks bearing the insignia of a red cross on a white background. Some people were standing around talking, and then suddenly there was shouting as some of them noticed us.
The next moment we were surrounded. Durathror explained simply &quot;We rescued these people from soldiers who massacred the rest of their village. Please help them. Most of them have been beaten and raped.&quot; Hands reached out to the refugees.
&quot;Who are you?&quot;
&quot;How did you rescue them?&quot; voices called out.
&quot;We are elves&quot; was Durathror's simple reply. &quot;We must go now.&quot;
He led us back up the hill, and then with a shimmer we were back in the clearing. We waited while Amrik's soldiers buried the dead, then we moved on again. There were no further incidents, though the gaiety had left us.
An hour later, Durathror brought us to England at Marston Moore, the scene of the battle some five weeks before. It was not a pretty sight. The dead lay where they fell, unburied, bodies bloated and rotting. Bones poked through where decaying flesh had rotted off, or been eaten by wild animals and birds. The stench was unbelievable. Many of the corpses had been robbed, much of the armor and equipment was missing. Even sadder than the dead soldiers was the number of dead horses. It occurred to me that Durathror had sought out the other incidents especially for Charles, Cromwell and the English.
Durathror turned and spoke in English. &quot;Lord Cromwell, King Charles, this is the scene of Cromwell's victory over prince Rupert. But for Danny, Prospero and their friends, prince Rupert would be lying there now.&quot; His voice rose with emotion &quot;This is the aftermath of your great victory! This is the glory of warfare! You two bear joint responsibility for starting this war, and you two bear joint responsibility for all these deaths. Look upon your handiwork both of you! This is the legacy of your pride!&quot; he thundered.
The king and the usurper looked at one another. Neither was looking particularly happy or proud. Cromwell muttered &quot;Soldiers die in warfare. It is not pretty, but that is what war is about.&quot;
&quot;Wrong Cromwell, war is about over-reaching ambition in the rulers, who then send out their soldiers to fight and die. You were not responding to an invasion! Neither of you had any excuse for this! Sometimes a soldier must put his life on the line, but that must be to defend his people and his country. Never should you make war on your own people, as you two have done. This is an abomination in god's sight! Neither of you are fit to rule the country, but I doubt that any of your fellow countrymen are any better.&quot;
We rode on, taking the road south. Durathror had obviously scouted the route in advance, because to ride to London would take five days. We shifted shadows many times along the road, but called in at the major towns along the route. We found out later that the rumor mill started working overtime at the sight of six elves riding white unicorns, and flanked by fifty warriors clad in burnished armor. Many also recognized the Lord Protector or King Charles.
The towns we visited all had an area set aside for executions, and each time we rode past the gibbets. In each case there were long rows of swinging bodies, many of them elderly, or women, or children, and most in various stages of decay.
The first time, Durathror turned again and spoke in English. &quot;Puritans! This is where your zeal for purity leads! You have murdered innocent women and children. All of you stand guilty of that, you all argued for the inquisition in your parliament. Are you any better than those soldiers we destroyed earlier today?! You make me sick!&quot;
At the next town we rode past thirty two women and children swinging on the gallows. None had been dead for more than a day or so. Durathror thundered &quot;Hypocrites! What would Jesus think of you? You have betrayed his teachings, and worshipped the devil!&quot;
Cromwell and Matthew had the decency to hang their heads in shame. Most of the puritans looked embarrassed. Henry looked belligerent, mumbling something under his breath.
Durathror countered &quot;I know you would like to see me swinging there, Henry. But you still follow Satan, as do all who preach the way of death. Your path will destroy you. Beware!&quot;
Cromwell turned to look at baron henry. &quot;Henry! Prince Durathror is correct, the witch inquisition was evil. Satan blinded all of us. We have done much evil, believing it to be good. Now we return to make amends. Think on this. We will talk later.&quot;
At each town, we also paused while Cromwell and king Charles spoke briefly to the local garrison commander, and delivered a written proclamation. We had had a number of these prepared before we left Bendora, and both Cromwell and King Charles had signed them and sealed them with their seals.
The proclamation stated that King Charles and Lord Protector Cromwell had signed a peace treaty ending the civil war. The king was restored to his throne, the declaration of outlawry was rescinded. The witch inquisition was dismantled. The parliamentary soldiers were directed to lay down their arms and return to their homes. Those who did so would be granted amnesty, those who refused would be prosecuted for treason.
Toward evening, we rode into the courtyard of Hampton Court Castle, about half a day's ride from London itself. The sky was clouding over, threatening rain later. Typical English summer really.
Our arrival caused consternation. The castle was not ready to receive so many unannounced guests, and there was a flurry of activity to prepare rooms and food. More important however were the rumors. Cromwell was dead, kidnapped by brigands along with the parliamentary leaders. King Charles had paid the brigands, or had also been killed by the brigands, or had fled to France.
In the wake of this, what remained of the parliament had appointed general Archibald Campbell, eighth Earl of Argyll as the new Lord Protector. The Scots had declared Charles dead, and crowned his son as Charles II of Scotland. Charles II was now claiming rights to the throne of England, but with little support from parliament.
Charles I arranged for his proclamation to be sent to the new lord Protector, the various generals and parliamentarians that evening. Included with that was a hastily penned note inviting each to attend a meeting at Hampton Court on the morrow, and signed by both Charles I and Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell.
A group of us sat in the main dining hall at Hampton Court, discussing what to do next. The hall was large and draughty, its walls covered with dark wood wainscoting half way up, and with white painted plaster above that. Numerous dark pictures of past royals and nobles hung on the walls. There were also a number of chandeliers sporting hundreds of lighted candles.
Cromwell seemed smugly satisfied. &quot;They will not accede to your demands! Argyll will have this place surrounded by parliamentary troops. He has no love for you Charles, not since you tried to have him murdered.&quot;
&quot;That is a base slander! We had no knowledge of any plot to murder him...&quot;
&quot;No? You instructed the would be murderers yourself!&quot;
&quot;We did not! But Argyll ordered the murders of the Earl of Stafford and the Archbishop of Canterbury!&quot;
&quot;They were sentenced to death for treason after a trial! Whereas you...&quot;
&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; I banged the table with my fists. They both looked at me in surprise. I continued more mildly, though still forcefully &quot;Both of you have crimes on your consciences, neither of you has clean hands. The past is the past, and cannot be changed. We are here to protect the future, and to prevent England from slipping back into the dark ages. You have both agreed to let bygones be bygones, to patch up your relationship, and to work together to make England a better and fairer place. We are here to discuss how to manage the transition from the current situation out there to the new government, one in which both of you will play key roles. As I see it, our first task is to re-establish Cromwell as lord Protector, and these puritans as the executive parliamentary committee. Once that happens, the civil unrest will be manageable, and we can hold the investiture to reinstate Charles as king. To accomplish that, we must convince the acting Lord Protector and his cronies that this is the correct thing to do.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;Which is why all of them are invited here for the meeting. But they may not come, or they may bring an army with them. If they bring their armies, we will meet with them, and convince them that they have nothing to fear.&quot;
Durathror interrupted &quot;If they bring their armies, Iskandor and I will deal with that. What will you do if they will not come?&quot;
&quot;We deal with those who do come. Those who will not attend must either be fetched here and included in the negotiations, or neutralized.&quot; I commented.
Prospero nodded. &quot;We may have to neutralize many of them. But we do need the current leaders here to deal with. The fact that Charles and Cromwell are not dead gives the lie to any claim of legitimacy they may have.&quot;
&quot;But why must they meet us here? Why can we not meet them in parliament?&quot;
Prospero stated something that was obvious to some of us. &quot;Because they may have an interest in Charles and you remaining dead. You could both be murdered and your bodies hidden.&quot;
&quot;But we parliamentarians are god fearing men!&quot; Cromwell protested. &quot;We do not stoop to murder like Charles does.&quot;
&quot;If you were god fearing men, you would not have a civil war on your consciences!&quot; Durathror observed acidly.
It took a little while to stop the recriminations and get the discussion back on track. Cromwell and the puritans were less inclined to give ground, and wanted things they had agreed to overturned. Charles would have liked to have all the parliamentarians arrested, but he lacked an army to back him on that.
Prospero was dreading the prospect of commencing negotiations again with another group of rulers. What was more, the witch inquisition was continuing, and innocent people were being tortured and murdered daily because of it.
We devised some general guidelines, but we wound have to wait for the new leaders to arrive the next day before we could see how things might unfold.
The facilities in the palace left something to be desired. There were no indoor toilets unless you made use of a chamber pot. The outdoor toilets were windy holes in the ground behind the stables. The palace was cold even in summer, and there was very little provision to heat water, especially for bathing. I think the Aquilonian contingent put a considerable strain on the resources of the palace.
Toward midmorning the parliamentary army arrived under the generalship of the Earl of Argyll. Several other parliamentarians were with him, but not all. He sent an emissary to ask for our surrender.
Prospero remarked &quot;Lord Cromwell, I think you must insist on meeting him in person. He will not be convinced of your bona fide otherwise.&quot;
Cromwell smiled sardonically. &quot;After plucking me from England, and badgering me to turn parliament's proclamations on their ends, now you want me to help you pull your irons from the fire?&quot;
&quot;Lord Cromwell, you yourself agreed to the changes we seek to make...&quot; Prospero began.
&quot;Under duress&quot; Cromwell interrupted.
&quot;Cromwell&quot; I barked. &quot;We don't have time for this crap! You back that agreement one hundred percent, or get lost. You agreed to it, now is the time to implement it. You either help out or we cut you out of the process, and deal with the others. But your hands are stained with the blood of innocent English! You must make amends.&quot;
Cromwell looked at me with an angry expression on his face, but it softened. He nodded &quot;You are correct, the mistakes are partly mine, so I must help redress them. Argyll will not lay down arms unless he is convinced that I am alive and support the proclamation. I had thought that with a new lord protector, I could return to my home and my family.&quot;
&quot;Once we have sorted out the transition to the new government. Then you may step down if you wish. Prospero, do you think Charles should also meet with the earl of Argyll?&quot;
&quot;Under a flag of truce, it could be arranged. It would show that Charles and Cromwell have indeed signed a truce, but it might be too much of a temptation to the earl of Argyll to capture king Charles.&quot;
&quot;We will not meet with Argyll out there. He must come to us.&quot; Charles stated flatly.
I was growing tired of all this pettiness. &quot;Charles, the same applies to you as to Cromwell. You agreed to this process, you support it one hundred percent, and help us to run it. If you don't...&quot;
&quot;You dare to threaten us?&quot; This was not the meek Charles we had seen in Aquilonia.
&quot;I do not threaten.&quot; I replied coldly and levelly. &quot;England needs a king, but it needs one who can govern sensibly. The Scots have already crowned your son. The English can do the same. You either join the process willingly, and behave sensibly as you did in Aquilonia, or we cut you out of it. You become plain Charles Stuart, retired king, and little to do except attend to your balls and your hunts.&quot;
Charles glowered at this, but Cromwell smiled in satisfaction. &quot;I may not like your methods, Earl Daniel, but at least you are even handed! I will send a messenger asking Argyll to meet me under a flag of truce.&quot;
Charles went into a sulk, walking to the other end of the room and sitting staring into the fire. He ignored us.
A little later, Cromwell, Durathror and I walked out to meet with the Earl of Argyll. Cromwell asked me as we walked &quot;Would you really cut Charles out of the process, and make his son king in his stead?&quot;
&quot;If necessary. I have no loyalty to him or any other. We negotiated a settlement that we believe is fair, and I thought that you and Charles both supported it as a reasonable compromise to stop the civil war and restore England to good government. If his removal from office is legal, then there is no requirement to reinstate him as king. We simply need a king, someone who is acceptable to parliament, the nobles and the people.&quot;
Cromwell nodded. &quot;I think many in parliament would be happier to see Charles' son on the throne. But the settlement we negotiated would put checks upon the kings powers, and might make Charles acceptable to parliament.&quot;
&quot;We are relying on you and your friends to sway the rest of parliament. Do you still support the deal?&quot;
Cromwell sighed. &quot;I do Daniel, as you say, it is fair, it bolsters the powers of parliament and curbs those of the king, yet it also imposes checks against the abuse of power by any in government. Our current system has no checks upon the powers of the parliament. You have convinced me that the proposed system is superior.&quot;
Durathror observed &quot;In you current system the powers of the office of Lord Protector are almost the same as those of the king. If you seek to curb the kings powers, then similar curbs must be placed upon the lord protector's powers.&quot;
We had to walk almost two hundred meters from the palace to meet with the Earl of Argyll. The idea was that the meeting place was far enough away that we need not fear rifle fire.
Argyll rode up with two aids and dismounted about twenty meters distant. As he dismounted, a squad of cavalry galloped up and threatened us with muskets. Durathror was here partly in case of such an eventuality.
&quot;Tell me why I should not have you summarily shot!&quot; the earl called out to us.
Cromwell made to speak, but I spoke first. &quot;Because you are a man of honor, and a man of god, you would not have us shot without a trial. But you break the truce by bringing your musketeers here. Send them away so that we can talk.&quot;
&quot;Brave words! Why should I trust a brigand?&quot;
Cromwell got his reply in first &quot;Argyll! He is no brigand. It is I, Oliver Cromwell! Send your musketeers away. Charles and I have signed a peace treaty.&quot;
&quot;Oliver! Is it really you?&quot; He stumped closer, peering myopically at us. He was stout in build and florid of face, in late middle age, and seeming to suffer from arthritis or gout. He walked slowly toward us until he could see Cromwell clearly enough.
&quot;It is I, Argyll. Charles and I have signed a peace treaty.&quot;
&quot;It is you after all! Well sir, it warms my heart to see you alive. We had heard you had been kidnapped by brigands, and murdered. Are you well?&quot;
&quot;I am well, though I did not expect you would threaten me under a flag of truce.&quot;
The earl of Argyll sent the musketeers back to his massed army. &quot;So, why should we accept Charles as king? What sort of peace treaty have you signed?&quot;
&quot;This is why we invited you to Hampton Court, along with all the key parliamentarians. We have a peace treaty, we have an agreement to a new form of parliamentary government, with curbs upon the king's powers. We need the parliamentary leaders here to discuss it. We do not need your army.&quot;
The earl nodded. &quot;You guarantee our safety? Who are these people with you?&quot;
Cromwell introduced us, and added &quot;They are envoys of the king of Aquilonia. They helped broker the peace accord. I can vouch for them, they are god fearing people, and mean you no harm.&quot;
The two spoke some more before the earl of Argyll was finally convinced. Then he and Cromwell ran through a list of names of people who should attend.
The two men shook hands. The earl of Argyll said &quot;Well Cromwell, they should all be happy to hear you are alive and well. God willing, we will return this afternoon.&quot; He mounted his horse, and rode back to his army.
Cromwell seemed pleased with himself. He rubbed his hands. &quot;So, the process will start. I will perform my part, let us hope that Charles will perform his part.&quot;
&quot;I hope so too. The outcome is too important to be stopped by an individual who sulks because he cannot have everything his own way. We are trying to ensure fairness to all, and he is in a position of privilege. I have little sympathy for him.&quot;
&quot;And I thought your sympathies lay more with him than with me.&quot;
I chuckled. &quot;On the contrary, lord Cromwell. Perhaps that was why I have been harsher with you than with him. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely...&quot;
&quot;I must remember that one, it is a turn of phrase I have not heard, but very apt. The king is certainly corrupt.&quot;
&quot;Thank you. But the same applies to anyone who has absolute power. I do not approve of any man having god like powers over their fellows.&quot; I had noticed before that when conversing with the English, I tended to a more archaic turn of phrase. &quot;We are all fallible, our best protection when we govern is that we have a committee of peers who will review and if necessary amend the laws we make. The House of Commons and the House of Lords are those committees. It is not perfect, but it is the best we can devise.&quot;
Cromwell was musing. &quot;Yes, I once felt that we should try to create a perfect society here, but you reminded me that only god is perfect, and to style ourselves the parliament of saints as some have designated parliament is to fall prey to the sin of pride. Satan has so many traps for those who would follow Christ.&quot;
Durathror added &quot;Satan has many traps, but god sets many tests, as he did to Job. If you would be a good Christian, then you must rise to those tests. If you would lead men, you must set an example to others. As a ruler, your tests are even harder.&quot;
&quot;Do you think the army will retreat?&quot;
Cromwell shook his head. &quot;I have my doubts. Argyll knows the king is within, he has him surrounded. He means to end this civil war one way or the other. Capturing the king would achieve his aims.&quot;
&quot;Provided the army does not try to attack, it can sit there for as long as it likes. If it does attack, it will be repulsed.&quot; Durathror offered.
&quot;That would mean bloodshed&quot; Cromwell warned. &quot;The civil war would not end.&quot;
Durathror smiled. &quot;Do not fear, lord Cromwell, there will be no bloodshed. We would prefer that they do not try to attack, so that you are hailed as the peacemaker, and the reforms will then be more readily accepted.&quot;
&quot;I need no accolades, prince Durathror.&quot;
&quot;Our purpose is the reforms to the form of government. You had the authority as lord protector, and you had parliament's respect.&quot; I countered. &quot;As the peacemaker, your credibility goes up. The reforms then become what you have always been trying to achieve. They are easier to implement, because they would have the support of the parliament.&quot;
&quot;Parliament has many factions. But perhaps you are right, lord Daniel, with the peace treaty we achieve our aims honorably, without the need to execute the king for treason. I would prefer to face my maker free from the stain of regicide.&quot;
&quot;So would we, lord Cromwell.&quot; I replied. &quot;But tell me, aren't we half a days ride from London? How then can he return with the others this afternoon?&quot;
&quot;Oh, you would not know, but there is a train line from here to London. The station is perhaps ten minutes on horseback. I expect that Argyll came here by train, his arthritis will not allow him to sit on a horse for too long. I believe the journey is but half an hour.&quot;
Durathror chuckled &quot;Didn't you know, Danny? That was one of the reasons we chose this palace. It is outside London, but the train makes it a quick journey. We were hoping that king Charles would grant it to us as our embassy.&quot; He added to me in a mental aside &lt;&lt;And London is so filthy you would not want to stay there.&gt;&gt; There was an image of a town with refuse and fecal matter piled in the streets, rats everywhere, unwashed people who stank to high heaven and were rife with fleas and lice. In a few years time they would be ravaged by the black death.
&lt;&lt;Here is better, I agree. I think we would have a mutiny from the Aquilonian contingent if we put them in London.&gt;&gt;
&quot;I doubt he would do that!&quot; Cromwell was astonished. &quot;This is a royal palace, he holds those very tightly.&quot;
&quot;Ah, but he is not yet restored as king, and that may not happen should he continue to behave as he is.&quot;
 Charles did not eat in the dining hall, we presumed he was sulking somewhere else in the palace.
Mid afternoon, Durathror asked us if we would like to head over to the station and wait for the train that was arriving soon. Most of us decided to do so, and with the accompanying escort of Aquilonian soldiers there was probably at least forty or fifty of us on horseback.
We followed a leafy pathway across the estate's grounds, until a detachment of parliamentary soldiers sought to bar our passage. Cromwell rode forward to deal with this.
&quot;Captain, do you recognize me?&quot;
&quot;Zirr, oi believe 'ee be tha Lord Cromwell.&quot; His accent was thick.
&quot;Correct, I am the Lord Protector of the commonwealth. Now stand aside and let us pass. We wish to await your general the Earl of Argyll.&quot;
&quot;But zirr, 'ee be tha lord protectorr, not 'ee. At least oi think zo.&quot;
&quot;Captain, you are not paid to think, but to follow orders. I am the Lord Protector, as well you know. The Earl of Argyll has been acting in that capacity while I was away. Now I have returned. Surly you can comprehend that?&quot;
The captain scratched his jaw, then nodded. &quot;Tha' mun be rroit. 'Ee be 'irr, and not 'im. Zo 'ee mun be lord protectorr ztill. Zirr, you may pazz!&quot; He turned to his squad. &quot;Ztand asoid an' let they lord protectorr pazz!&quot;
I looked around as we waited, and spied several other squads of soldiers at varying distances. It looked to me as if the army did indeed surround Hampton Court. We proceeded to the station.
There was a single narrow track running off into the distance. The station was a simple platform of stone with a small hut at one end. The ground sloped toward the track, and the platform had been constructed so that while it was raised beside the track, the other side was level with the ground, making it easy to drive carts onto and off the platform. The track extended away from the platform in both directions, but to our left we could see that the track ran in a big loop, allowing a train to turn around and head back to London. It was all very rural looking, but give it four hundred years and all that would be left would be the palace gardens; the rest would be sold for residential sites.
We didn't have long to wait before we could hear the train chugging its way along the track. A few minutes later it appeared. It was a flat platform mounted on six steel wheels. A large water tank occupied at least half the platform, with a boiler and firebox set behind. The driver and the stoker stood behind that, exposed to the elements, with little but some brass railings to prevent them from falling off. Behind the engine was the fuel cart, half full of split logs. Behind that were two boxy looking carriages made of painted wood and brass work, and behind them were three flat cars with high walls and carrying horses.
The train rolled slowly into the station and ground to a halt with a few screeches and shudders. We waited patiently while the passengers disembarked and the small squad of soldiers unloaded the horses. Cromwell and a few others went over to greet the new arrivals. Prospero asked prince Rupert and myself to accompany him to the engine so he could have a good look.
Introductions were performed, people mounted up, and eventually we rode back to Hampton Court. The domestic staff went into a flap trying to arrange rooms for everyone, an evening meal and refreshments.
It was a little before four thirty in the afternoon before we all sat around in the dining hall, sipping tea or coffee, and nibbling on small cakes and slices of bread with jam or honey. Charles was conspicuous by his absence.
One parliamentarian, Thomas Pride I think, asked &quot;A peace treaty is all well and good, but why should the king of Aquilonia and the queen of the Viharani be privy to the affairs of England?&quot;
&quot;They will not be so privy, but they helped to broker the peace accord, and they will help us with some of the reforms. They offer friendship and advice.&quot; Cromwell observed smoothly.
Amrik replied &quot;I am the king of Aquilonia, I can appreciate you would not want us present and meddling in your affairs. We will not meddle, beyond helping to see the peace accord implemented. We can offer some advice, but we also hope to learn from you good people. Seven years ago we fought a civil war and deposed and executed our despotic and tyrannical king. I am now the king, but with duke Prospero and Earl Daniel, we are setting about a reform of government, introducing houses of parliament along similar lines to yours, and curbing the powers of the king. As I said, we can offer you advice, but we can also learn from you. We wish to present you with the settlement that has been negotiated, but after that, should you wish to hold discussions on private, that is your prerogative, and we will remove ourselves from this chamber.&quot;
They put it to a vote, there were nine against us being there, the rest were for it. Then they became embroiled in a procedural discussion about who was lord protector, Cromwell or the earl of Argyll. There was an argument that it should remain with Argyll, there was an argument that the assumptions were wrong, and that Argyll could never have been validly appointed, which had implications for the decrees they had made in the past few weeks. Some seemed to think that they needed the full assembly to sort that one out.
The rest of us were growing increasingly irritated, until Prospero urged me to interrupt. &quot;My lords, might I make a suggestion? The earl of Argyll was appointed Lord Protector on the assumption that lord Cromwell was dead. Rumors of his death have obviously been exaggerated, that certainly means the assumption under which the earl of Argyll assumed the office was incorrect. But lord Cromwell was out of the country, it was necessary to have someone appointed as acting Lord Protector for the duration. I would think that the earl of Argyll was validly appointed, but his appointment can only be valid for the period of lord Cromwell's absence. Now that Lord Cromwell has returned to England, he is again the lord protector, unless he desires to step down in favor of someone else. So, the earl of Argyll has been validly appointed Lord Protector, but that office now reverts to Lord Cromwell. It should be similar to an army in the field, when the commanding officer is incapacitated.&quot;
They argued some more, but the military among them agreed with my assessment. Argyll himself stood and declaimed &quot;If the general is captured or believed killed, command passes to the next in line. Any orders the officer issues are valid until the general resumes the field. Of course my appointment was valid! Now that Lord Cromwell has returned, he resumes the office of Lord Protector!&quot;
Finally it was settled, and they agreed to listen to the accord. Durathror interrupted with &quot;Should we not have Charles here?&quot;
There were some refusals. Argyll stated emphatically &quot;Only so long as he sits over there! I will not have him sitting anywhere near me.&quot;
They took their time discussing it, then put it to the vote. This time there were eleven against and twenty nine for Charles being present.
Durathror excused himself, saying &quot;I go to persuade him to honor us with his presence.&quot;
&quot;Careful he doesn't have you beheaded for treason!&quot; quipped one of the parliamentarians. I'm afraid I do not know the names of most of them.
&quot;He'd have to find an executioner first. I thought they were all in your pay!&quot; Durathror responded flippantly as he departed. I don't think all the English got the joke.
They began arguing over how Charles should be addressed, but Cromwell quickly quashed that. &quot;I have rescinded the decree of outlawry. The treaty also provides that Charles be restored to his throne. If we ratify the treaty, he will again be his majesty. If we do not, then he is still deposed. That was done legally, he is to be addressed by the title of Prince Charles the senior, or simply Your Highness, but not Your Majesty.&quot;
John Pym observed acidly &quot;If his removal from the throne were not done legally, then all of us stand here guilty of treason. We are the parliament, we constitute the law making body of England, we passed the law deposing king Charles. So, 'twas done legally. QED&quot;
A little later a somewhat subdued Charles Stuart entered the dining hall. I think Durathror had done something to make him acquiescent. Many of the parliamentarians rose to their feet when he entered, but Cromwell bade them sit. &quot;He is not yet restored, he should not be accorded that honor until he is restored.&quot;
Charles surveyed the room, then remarked &quot;Good afternoon gentlemen. It is pleasing to see that some of you remember your manners. As you see, you are not rid of me so easily...&quot;
Durathror interrupted &quot;Charles, find a chair and sit down!&quot; Charles sat on the first chair he came to, sitting beside Liz. &quot;and stop behaving like a naughty schoolboy.&quot; There were gasps from the assembled puritans. Charles himself looked shocked, but sat quietly.
Durathror continued &quot;I am afraid I am a military man, with a soldier's love of plain speaking. You must forgive me if I sometimes appear rude. Now, Danny and I will read out the agreement, and answer questions about it. After that it will be up to you to discuss it, but it has been agreed by both lord Cromwell and lord Matthew for parliament, and by Charles himself. I am sure you will realize that altering the agreement will mean that neither parliament nor Charles is bound by it, and the civil war continues, unless all parties here can agree to the changes. We&quot; he indicated the Viharani and Aquilonians &quot;are here as observers, and as facilitators for any negotiations you might wish to hold with Charles. While you can discuss the agreement in private, any negotiations about changes will have to be done in the presence of the facilitators.&quot;
There was something about his voice that seemed to compel obedience. The puritans looked at each other, and nodded agreement. Cromwell said &quot;You may proceed Prince Durathror.&quot;
We wished to avoid the obvious use of translation spells, which might cause alarm to the puritans. Thus it was necessary to have someone who could read English read out the agreement. Unfortunately for the girls they were disqualified simply because puritan England was extremely chauvinistic, and did not permit females to play an active role in any form of government or negotiations. To quote Samuel Johnson &quot;A woman preaching is like a dog walking on its hind legs. It is not done well, but the marvel is that it is done at all.&quot;
I quote this simply to show the attitude prevalent amongst not only the puritans, but also prevalent among the general population.
Durathror and I took it in turns to read paragraphs from the agreement. We stopped frequently as what we read provoked disagreement. Rather than try to debate the contentious point immediately, we wrote the issue up on a black board, and continued. Many of the politicians were not happy with this approach, but we kept pointing out that until they had heard the complete agreement they couldn't see how things fitted together. I kept reminding them that they should treat it like the reading of a proposed bill, where the debate happened after the reading.
There were a number of issues, many of them religious based. They would be harder to address, neither Durathror nor I could decide whether they should be first, last, or simply dealt with in order of writing. Prospero favored the order of writing, Durathror favored dealing with them first, I preferred to deal with them later. We broke for dinner, agreeing to discuss the issues after. We ended up going through the issues in order.
Most of them wanted an end to the civil war, which was gratifying. However, they weren't so concerned about the civil suffering, but they could all perceive that the war was weakening England, and would encourage catholic monarchs such as the king of Spain and the king of France to invade in support of their own claims on the English throne.
One of the conditions was that Charles be restored to the throne with reduced powers. Unfortunately few of them actually wanted Charles back at all. The general consensus was that Charles was despotic, arrogant, unreliable and treasonous for his involvement with France and for starting the civil war. Some of the subtle points were lost on the rest of us, but they alleged that Charles had started the war with his indecisive attack at Edgehill near Nottingham in 1642. His treasonous relationship with France seemed to be because of his marriage to the French Princess Henrietta Maria. The French of course were catholic, which angered the puritans.
Charles sat and glowered at the speakers as they ran through their litany of complaints against him. I felt he was marking each speaker in his memory, and would extract vengeance later.
Cromwell took the floor and quite surprisingly spoke eloquently about how the office of lord Protector was just as open to autocratic abuse as having a monarch, while having a monarch supplied them with stability. He argued that no man was perfect, and that good government should not be predicated upon the goodness of a single individual. Instead, the government had to have checks and balances to ensure that while good men could shine, capricious men could be curbed.
&quot;Prince Charles the senior has accepted this agreement, including the curbs and controls upon the powers of the monarch. The monarch and the Lord Protector are jointly commanders of the army, this agreement stipulates that neither can attack the other. Whoever does so will be impeached and removed from office. That includes the king! Should he seek to threaten Parliament again as he did in the past, it would be illegal for him to command the army to do so. The generals would have no choice but to refuse, and have him arrested. Once we ratify these changes to the form of government, then the king cannot undo them without the approval of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons.&quot;
The parliamentary changes seemed more acceptable since it granted the House of Commons more power, including that of veto over legislation passed by the House of Lords or the Monarch. The budget for running the country was to be framed jointly by a committee of the king and his advisors and members drawn from the Houses of Parliament. Charles had been very unhappy about that, but he wanted his throne back, and agreeing was the only way for that to happen.
There was much religious argument about the abolishing of the witch inquisition, but Cromwell and Matthew would not budge. They had been convinced of the evil of the inquisition, and argued quite strongly against it.
Through all this Charles sat looking bored. He made it plain he had absolutely no interest in these proceedings. Amrik was another who looked bored, though he at least tried to conceal it. Imladril and Iskandor looked pre-occupied, as if they were involved in sorcery and had only half a mind for the proceedings.
Henry spoke up for the faction arguing for stronger measures against Catholics, and wanted the witch inquisition to continue. The line &quot;The only good catholic is a dead catholic&quot; was uttered and supported by a number of puritans.
&quot;And what of the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill'? Yet you would murder Christians because they disagree with you!&quot; I interjected. &quot;Take the log from your own eye before you remove the spec from your brother's eye!&quot;
Cromwell waved me down. &quot;Gentleman, once I agreed with you. We all thought that to be a good Christian, it was necessary to correct the errors in others' thoughts. If they would now willingly allow themselves to be so corrected, then we executed them to prevent their pollution from spreading. Then one day Lord Daniel, the Earl of Bendora, quoted scripture to me, and challenged me to find a scriptural basis for any deeds we had done. But he went further than that, and challenged me to find a passage that showed what god intended we should do in this situation. I have searched the scripture to find passages appropriate to what we do, and I searched with an open mind, to discover god's will on these matters.
&quot;I have found that it is easy to find a passage that will support any action we have taken, but I can also find passages to suggest we have taken the wrong action. How can both these be right? How can the bible be wrong? I give credit where credit is due. Earl Daniel told me to look at the old covenant and the new, and to determine which parts of the bible pertain to the old covenant and not the new. Lord Matthew and Sir Mark, together with Simon Lambert, Thomas Pride and I have looked deeply into this matter over the past five weeks. Let me tell you what we found!&quot; His voice was rising.
&quot;We found that we have done evil in the name of good! We have followed the old covenant, and not the new!&quot; He thundered. &quot;Our strongest argument for executing those who will not change their opinions comes from Leviticus, where the punishment for apostasy from the Law of Moses is death! But if we accept that, then all of us here must also stand guilty of apostasy! We eat pork, meat forbidden Jews! We are thus guilty of transgressing the Law of Moses! Our answer is found in St. Paul. The Law of Moses is the old covenant, while we by our acceptance of our blessed savior are under the new covenant. St. Paul makes it abundantly clear, either we accept the new covenant, and put aside the laws of Moses, or we abide by the laws of Moses, and perish in our righteousness, having forsaken our salvation!&quot;
There were murmurs at this. Puritans took as an article of faith that they should abide by the covenant with god, but many of them assumed that meant everything in the Old Testament as well. Cromwell spoke more about the difference between the two covenants, and how he and the others had apportioned passages of the Old Testament. I had to admire him, once he was convinced of his original error and how to correct it, he doggedly pursued his quarry until he caught it. He spoke with fire, he spoke with eloquence, quite unlike his usual thin carping voice.
&quot;As you can see, many of us have mistakenly believed that we were obeying Jehovah's word when we were perverting the words of our savior to follow the old covenant. We have allowed Satan to tempt us away from following the words of Jesus. Jesus taught compassion and forgiveness, but we have shown little compassion in our dealings with those who do not follow the puritan way. Instead we have killed, breaking the sixth commandment, and we have rewarded those who give false witness against their neighbor, breaking the ninth and the tenth.&quot;
He paused for breath, surveyed those in front of him. &quot;The road to hell is paved with good intentions! We must mend our ways! We must right the wrongs we have done in god's name. We have behaved no better than the King of Spain with his inquisition! How many of you would want to be thought worse Christians than Spanish Catholics?&quot;
He was their leader, and now I could see why. He had most of them in the palm of his hand. Many of the religious objections they had raised to the agreement were rubbed off the board.
They broke late that evening, without finishing their debate. Imladril asked the rest of us to join her for a night cap before retiring. She turned and offered her arm to Charles. &quot;Perhaps you would care to joins us your majesty?&quot;
Charles accepted, but smiled deprecatingly &quot;Thank you your majesty, you are most kind. I trust I am not intruding?&quot;
&quot;Of course not Charles, I am inviting you. We need to talk about today's events.&quot;
We headed up a flight of stairs, and along a draughty corridor. Durathror conjured floating lights to light our way. Charles commented &quot;I should not let any of the puritans see you do that. You would be condemned for witchcraft.&quot;
Durathror smiled a dangerous smile. &quot;These puritans play at piety, with no understanding. Cromwell and a few others are good men lead astray, but many more are thoroughly evil men trying to appear good. Power comes from god, not the devil. The devil has only the power to tempt us and lead us astray. The devil exists and operates only on god's sufferance. These puritans serve the devil under the pretence of serving god. Should they cross me, I shall make an example of them.&quot;
We entered the suite and seated ourselves around the sitting room. Prospero commented to our group &quot;It is encouraging, but it could be days or even weeks before they finish.&quot;
Amrik smiled sourly &quot;It is these interminable debates that I have no stomach for. Give me a battlefield any day! There were many times tonight I longed to bang a few heads together. I think there are a few necks there that could benefit from stretching too!&quot;
Charles smiled and nodded &quot;I agree, king Amrik. There are several persons there who would benefit from the headsman's axe. They seek nothing less than the destruction of England. Many of the rest are ignorant ratbags.&quot;
Prospero chuckled. &quot;Gross ignorance - one hundred and forty four politicians!&quot;
Imladril and Iskandor fetched wines, juices and delicacies from a dozen shadows. Both Charles' and Rupert's eyes bugged out as the viands appeared on the table.
Imladril waved at the food. &quot;Please help yourselves. We Viharani do not use servants. We do not believe anyone should serve another.&quot; We helped ourselves to the food and drink. Rupert poured for Charles.
Imladril continued &quot;Charles, Rupert, we show you this to demonstrate that we have powers the puritans could not guess at. I agree with my brother, if they attempt to cross us, we will be forced to deal with them in such a manner that they will never think to try again.&quot;
Rupert asked &quot;Your majesty, could youà&quot; he stopped, corrected himself. &quot;I mean Imladril, could your powers deal with the army camped outside? There are perhaps five hundred or a thousand soldiers there.&quot;
Imladril smiled. &quot;Yes, here we are informal, so please do not use titles to us. Durathror and Iskandor have already dealt with the army.&quot; She looked at her brother.
&quot;The army has packed up and returned to its barracks in London. It would appear they have no further reason for being here.&quot;
&quot;But surely their commander the Earl of Argyll would not order their retreat?&quot;
Durathror tapped the side of his nose and winked. &quot;Like I said Rupert, their commander issued orders for them all to return to barracks. This they have done. Had he tried to order them to attack, he would have found himself unable to utter the words.&quot;
Charles looked at them with a calculating expression. &quot;And if the army decided to attack at dawn? Without their commander's orders?&quot;
Durathror was still smiling. &quot;Should they try that they will find themselves beset by such terror that they will fling away their weapons and flee for their lives. You saw what we did to those soldiers we passed on the way here.&quot;
Imladril changed the topic. &quot;How do each of you feel the discussion is going? Will the parliament ratify the agreement between Charles and Cromwell?&quot;
Charles spoke first. &quot;I much fear that the parliament will balk at my restoration. Many there were clamoring for my head only a month ago. Even Danny has threatened that he will put my son on the throne in my stead. Are your interests mine?&quot;
Durathror responded &quot;Our interests are our own. To be honest Charles, you are not the best of kings, you are arrogant, autocratic and despotic, while at the same time given to sudden changes of mind and acting on whims without thought for the consequences. However, your son is young, and would be a weak king, easily bent to Cromwell's will. I believe that you have it within you to be a great king, if you will be guided for the nonce. There is the agreement, negotiated between you and Cromwell, which would restore you to the throne, and at the same time curb the powers of the monarch and the parliament. As far as we are concerned, we are here to ensure that the agreement is ratified without change, and ratified wholeheartedly. Only thus will lasting peace be restored to England. You could be remembered for centuries to come as an enlightened king like Queen Elizabeth is remembered. As it is, you are more likely to be like the Roman Emperor Nero, as the king who fiddled while England burned, and then lost his head. You could be a great king, but if you would be king, you must support this agreement wholeheartedly. You have been less than enthusiastic so far.&quot;
Charles looked around the room. He looked sad, but thoughtful. &quot;Queen Elizabeth is remembered as a good queen, though she was ruthless in suppressing opposition. I too tried to suppress opposition who would overthrow me, but with less success. I learned my kingship from my father, among other things I learned to trust no courtier or noble, that everyone sought to curry favor from me, that all would flatter me to my face, but would happily stab me in the back behind my back.&quot;
He paused to drink some coffee. &quot;I believe I have seen much in the past five weeks to teach me how to be a better king. I am not king Amrik, but I have seen how he rules, and this agreement would set up a similar system to that. But in addition, for the first time in my life I have met a group of people who treat me as a friend and an equal, who show me no deference to my royal status. You might note I have dropped the royal &quot;we&quot; when I am among you.&quot; He smiled.
Prospero commented &quot;I had been wondering why you often used &quot;we&quot; to refer to yourself. I put it down to my faulty understanding of English.&quot;
Charles explained that it came from the bible, where god appeared to refer to himself as plural, as in &quot;Let us make man...&quot; and added &quot;and so we monarchs have become accustomed to referring to ourselves as &quot;we&quot; rather than &quot;I&quot;.
Durathror chuckled and shook his head. &quot;Some other time perhaps Danny and I might explain that those old testament passages are not quite what they may appear to be in English. But for tonight, the important question is whether you will fully support the agreement, and argue for it in the parliament. If you cannot support it, and continue to support it once we depart, then come two or three months and the parliament will depose you again.&quot;
Charles smiled ruefully &quot;I had hoped to negotiate a better deal for myself. Can you not simply compel the puritans to support the agreement?&quot;
Durathror laughed. &quot;We could, and we could compel you to accept it also, but tomorrow the compulsion would wear off. There is no lasting hope unless both you and Cromwell willingly support it. God has given all of us free will. You have your agreement, I am sure Cromwell will argue for you with parliament, provided you also do your part.&quot;
Amrik added forcefully &quot;You are a man who would be king. You above all men should be a man of your word! You gave your word over this agreement, now you must keep it!&quot; He stabbed his finger onto the table with a resounding thump.
Prospero added &quot;It is often said of politics that it is the art of lying with a straight face. The main reasons why governments have so many problems is that the people who govern go back on their words, and show favoritism.&quot;
Charles looked around at us. &quot;Will you all give me your words that you will support this agreement also? Lord Danny, will you support me and not my son?&quot;
I smiled at Charles &quot;My threat to you was in terms of if you did not support the agreement. I stand by what I said then. If you support and ratify the agreement, then I will support your restoration. Your son shall become king in the normal manner. If you refuse to support the agreement, then what choice to you leave anyone? Cromwell is only bound to support the agreement as long as you support it. He has been arguing for your restoration. Parliament would find it much easier to support your son.&quot; I shrugged.
Then I found the words I had been looking for. I looked him in the eye &quot;This is your chance to be a great king, like Henry the eighth and Elizabeth. This is your chance to make England a just and free land, where all may prosper. For too long people have suffered under despotic kings who taxed them into the ground, and religious fanatics who tortured and killed them for their beliefs. England needs prosperity, England needs religious freedom, England needs a just and good king. I believe you can be that king, if you but choose to be.&quot;
The others echoed my sentiments. Charles tugged on his beard thoughtfully. He nodded. &quot;I thank you for your statements of support. I will support the agreement to parliament, and try to present a united front with Cromwell. I believe that he is a man of his word, prickly though he might be. I just pray that we can win over the rest of parliament.&quot;
 That night in dreaming, Nalini and I met as usual at the street of cafes in the university town. Durathror and Ra'anor were waiting for us, as was Paula. Ra'anor looked quite barbaric with her leathers, her tattoos and her wild red hair.
&quot;Hi guys!&quot; Paula greeted us. &quot;Prospero should be along soon.&quot; She was eating a brightly colored sundae, something she never eats in waking.
Durathror commented &quot;Tonight we will take you to a place where Imladril and I often meet up. We'll wait for Prospero though.&quot;
We nodded, and ordered coffees from the hovering waiter. He had no aura, indicating he was a dreaming construct, a virtual person if you will, programmed to function as a waiter here. He seemed in his mid twenties, with Latin features, dressed in black trousers and immaculate white shirt. On his head was a straw boater with red green and white ribbons around the crown.
As a dreaming construct, he was incapable of independent thought or free will. I thought about virtual persons I might create using a computer. While I wasn't an expert, I do understand the basics of doing this, I understand programming, and I understand computers. But what supplied the program and processor for this construct? What motivated it?
Nalini caught my thought, as she often does. &quot;Maybe Durathror knows? I understand how inanimate objects are created. This table is a construct, it's just formed out of the dreaming stuff. But it doesn't have to do anything other than be a table. It doesn't have to react to us. But I don't know about how the waiter works. Do you Durathror?&quot;
Durathror smiled a perplexed smile. &quot;We complain that the old sorcerers do without understanding how they do. I have never given the doing of the waiter much thought. You visualize what you want to create, you know how a waiter should behave, and that sets the pattern. It is our personal power that keeps the waiter as he is. The combined personal power of everyone here is hooked into the doing of this place. It is hard to over-ride that. But it is incorrect to think of the waiter as a person, he does not have a soul, unlike us.&quot;
&quot;You've heard of the Turing test haven't you?&quot; He shook his head. I explained &quot;That's where you are screened in a room, and communicate via a computer screen with someone in another room. You don't know whether the person in the other room is a real person or a computer construct. If you can't tell the difference, then is that person &quot;real&quot; even if it is a computer? Erm... I think I've answered my question.&quot;
Durathror spoke slowly, thinking. &quot;If it has a soul, then it is capable of free will, and independent action, and has some form of self awareness. If it has no soul, then it is a construct, it can never behave outside the mould that made it, and it has no self awareness. I have some familiarity with computers, but I am not sure I understand your question.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;I understand Danny's question. We'll have to show you some of the computer agents in my home shadow. Many of them can pass the Turing test, what we are wondering is whether they have a soul. But both of us understand the basics of creating these agents, neither of us understand how the waiter can speak and respond to us with no computer behind it to give it life.&quot;
Durathror nodded. &quot;It is a construct. It hooks into your memories. If you ask it questions, it will answer from your experience. If I ask it, it will answer from my experience. It can never tell me something I do not know, unless there is a group of us around it, in which case it can pick anyone's mind for information.&quot;
&quot;But a computer construct has a processor to execute the instructions. What performs that function in the waiter?&quot;
Liz arrived, holding a confused looking Rupert by the hand. &quot;Hey everyone, I managed to find him this time!&quot;
Durathror took Rupert by the other hand, and held it for a few moments. Rupert brightened visibly, then started as if waking up. He looked around, then commented &quot;I'm dreaming, aren't I?&quot;
We assured him this was the case. He smiled, settled himself into a chair beside Liz. The waiter hovered, and he turned to ask what was on offer. The waiter handed him a menu.
Durathror turned back to Nalini and me. &quot;I can't answer that question. The waiter is a construct, constructed from the stuff of dreaming. Call it the mind of god if you will.&quot;
&quot;What are you people talking about?&quot; Liz asked. We explained as best we could.
She looked at the waiter and shrugged. &quot;So he's not a real person, he's like a robot. That's cool. How can you tell?&quot;
Rupert was placing his order. Durathror said simply &quot;He looks the same as he would in waking, he has no aura. We all have auras, though you may not be able to see that yet.&quot;
Liz looked around us, then made a rueful expression. &quot;I guess I can't see them.&quot;
The waiter moved away, Rupert turned to us. &quot;What was that about the waiter not being real?&quot;
&quot;Oh, he's real&quot; Durathror responded &quot;but he is a dreaming construct, made by our collective wills and imagination. He has no soul, he is incapable of free will, he does not know he exists. He is no more than this table or these chairs.&quot;
Rupert sat digesting this for a time. Finally he commented &quot;Do you mean he is like a demon?&quot;
The waiter returned bearing a tray, deposited coffee and chocolate cake for Liz, beer and apple strudel for Rupert.
&quot;No, what you would call a demon has a soul, and so possesses self awareness and free will. The angels do also, for how else could Lucifer have rebelled against god unless he had free will?&quot; Durathror grinned. &quot;The waiter is like a painting, except a painting that can move and behave in certain ways. We were discussing how he could move and react, but none of us know the answer to that.&quot;
Rupert nodded, then looked puzzled. &quot;I have not thought about this world of dreaming much, except that I have considered it to be as real as waking. I just assumed that everyone here was alive, like back home.&quot; He drank some beer, then remarked &quot;Hey! This is real German beer! It's much nicer than English beer. And this strudel is just like the ones we make back in Germany!&quot;
Durathror smiled. &quot;Here you can taste anything you can conceive of. But you can never taste something that you haven't tasted in waking. You don't have taste buds, you are experiencing the memory of how German beer should taste.&quot; That set them off into an explanation of how things in the dreaming realm could be changed to match our wills.
Prospero arrived while this was happening, decided to try what Rupert was having, and then was disappointed when he realized that he couldn't experience the real taste, only his conception of what it might taste like. &quot;Rupert, one day, you will have to treat me to real German beer and German strudel.&quot;
Durathror commented &quot;When you do, I'd like to be invited as well.&quot;
&quot;I am most happy to do so.&quot; Rupert looked at us and remarked candidly &quot;I take it this means you people intend to remain in contact with me once this affair is over?&quot;
&quot;Of course!&quot; Liz exclaimed. &quot;Erm, I mean, I can't shadow shift, I'll have to rely on the others.&quot;
Durathror smiled impishly. &quot;Ah ha!&quot; He twirled his moustache. &quot;If young Rupert can prove himself capable, then it is possible that you and he might both learn the art of shadow shifting. It would be good for the two of you to practice together. We shall be returning to his home shadow from time to time, so if you are willing, Rupert, we will remain in contact. If young Liz is willing, we will bring her along when we can.&quot;
He looked at them, Rupert looked at Liz. &quot;My lady, will you visit me from time to time?&quot;
&quot;If they'll bring me, sure!&quot;
Rupert almost sighed. &quot;Then I am content.&quot; He grinned suddenly. &quot;It seems I have incentive to learn the art of shadow walking.&quot;
Ra'anor had a motherly look on her face. &quot;And so you should. Liz needs someone of a similar skill level to train with, and so will you. We'll make sure you get to see each other while you are training.&quot;
&quot;You'll have to visit us too&quot; Nalini cut in. &quot;Our home shadow is quite different from the one you're used to, but Prospero adapted, so I'm sure you'll cope.&quot;
Liz looked a little stricken. &quot;I hope he won't be disappointed.&quot; she said softly.
Nalini commented &quot;Liz, you are who you are, and Rupert just has to accept you as you are. That is the mark of friendship. It will take a while for the two of you to get to know one another properly, so do not rush things.&quot;
&quot;And do not have too many expectations of one another.&quot; I continued. &quot;When you have expectations you force the other into a mould they do not fit, and this leads to disappointment.&quot;
&quot;Sage words.&quot; Durathror commented, while Rupert and Liz both nodded. &quot;Prince Rupert, you should know that there will be those who would condemn you as a sorcerer should we teach you. You may also find that eventually you move away from your home shadow to somewhere more enlightened.&quot;
Rupert nodded, shrugged. &quot;I may be a prince, but I have no lands and no kingdom unless both my older brothers die. I came to England and the court of my cousin to broaden my mind. Little did I realize that events would turn the way they have. I have a yen to travel. I had thought that when this civil war was over, I might visit the Americas. Now I know there are other earths to visit I should like to visit them as well. I no longer feel that I have a home here in England, nor for that matter in Germany.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;Travel broadens the mind right enough. I met Paula, and learned that there was a whole new world out there waiting for me, and a wondrous one at that.&quot; His eyes were sparkling. &quot;There are dangers, but a soldier needs some danger from time to time, otherwise he grows stale. I am sure you will not regret it.&quot;
Rupert smiled. &quot;I do want to see my children grow up. There was a time just before you rescued me when I feared I might not live long enough to sire any. I should like to learn, and I should like to remain friends with you all.&quot;
&quot;Then let us drink to that.&quot; Durathror announced. Goblets of wine appeared on the table. He lifted the one closest to him and held it in the air. The rest of us picked up ours, we clinked them together, then drank. The goblets were blued glass decorated with gold, the wine in them blood red and sweet like port. Of course, this was my version of its taste.
We sat and talked a little while, until Durathror announced &quot;They have returned. It is time for us to leave here.&quot;
&quot;Where are we going?&quot;
&quot;To a place where Imladril and I like to meet.&quot; He stood, taking Ra'anor's hand. &quot;Could all of you please take hold of one of us?&quot;
As we did so, he explained to Rupert &quot;How we travel in the world of dreaming is the same as shadow walking, except it is easier for us here. You can travel anywhere you can imagine, but it is difficult to go anywhere you have not been before. If I described where we are going to Danny, Nalini, Paula and Prospero, and asked them to make their own way there, none would arrive, though they would each reach a different place that resembles my description.&quot;
&quot;Four different places likely&quot; Ra'anor interrupted. &quot;They'd each have their own idea, and that's where they'd go. We have to take you there the first time, then you can find your way back there.&quot;
Durathror added &quot;You can picture a place, or you can picture an individual, and you will travel to that place, or to where the individual is. Let's go.&quot;
There was a slight churning sensation in the solar plexus, and we were there. As Durathror remarked, the same powers are involved in shadow shifting, which is why it is taught in dreaming first. Anyone can learn to do it there, and having learned, can develop the necessary energies to perform the same feat in the physical world.
We arrived floating in the air above a large wooden platform attached to the trunk of an enormous tree. The sky was many shades of blue, and looked as if it has been painted in watercolors on wet paper. Our tree soared over the forest canopy that stretched beneath us, a carpet of dark green. The tree was one of the huge trees in which the Viharani made their homes. We were perhaps three hundred meters off the ground, and the trunk here was at least ten or fifteen meters in diameter. The tree stretched up into the heavens easily another two hundred meters. The trunk itself was hollowed out into rooms, one above the other something like a light house. A number of similar trees stood around at irregular distances. Their branches were thick but sparse, and covered with broad green leaves. Their colors were vibrant, full of life.
The vista sloped gradually up behind us. Before us, the canopy parted to reveal a large lake of sapphire blue, ringed on the further side by a range of snow capped mountains. To the left water spewed forth from one of the high peaks, a distant torrent of noise, foaming white, that tumbled into the lake from a height many times that of our vantage point. The shores of the lake were a riot of brilliantly colored flowers.
On the platform with us were Imladril and Iskandor, accompanied by King Charles, Cromwell, Matthew, Lord Argyl and several other puritans. They were seated around a wooden table, talking animatedly. We were hovering, and I remembered something durathror had said about levitation was a skill that the viharani learned almost before they could walk. Perhaps one day Nalini and I would master that particular skill.
We alighted on the platform. Durathror swept his arm around &quot;It is a wondrous view, is it not? Regard it well, that you may return here of your own volition.&quot; His English sounded slightly archaic, and I thought he had been spending too much time in contact with the English.
Cromwell looked around at us and smiled. It didn't make him look any prettier, showing his gapped and yellowed teeth. &quot;The view is magnificent, is it not? My greetings and felicitations to all you lords and ladies.&quot; He seemed quite happy.
Prospero returned &quot;Greetings and felicitations to you all in return. You seem rather happy today Lord Cromwell, or should that be tonight?&quot;
&quot;I know that I dream, and yet you all are here with me. I had often thought that dreams were more than imagination, more than a mere theater of the sleeping mind. Tonight I have seen and understood that my soul is not confined to my body, but may roam whene're I sleep. Her majesty queen Imladril has conducted us on a tour of this realm, and we have met many who have died. Truly did out lord Jesus say &quot;In my father's house there are many mansions.&quot;...&quot;
Matthew interrupted &quot;We had always thought that it should read more like &quot;My father's house has many rooms...&quot; for how can a house have many houses, unless it refers to noble houses?&quot;
&quot;...But now we know that this realm of dreams is the kingdom of god&quot; Cromwell continued, only to be interrupted by Matthew again.
&quot;And so is a mansion or house by simile, but each... er... I cannot call each place we visited a house, can I?&quot;
Cromwell harrumphed &quot;Each locale we visited is an abode of the dead, and not all are dead in Christ. I never liked the idea that a compassionate god would condemn to hell all those who died before Christ was born, or who never heard of our blessed savior. But each abode is properly a house or mansion, so Jesus spoke truly when he said his father's house has many mansions.&quot; His eyes lit up. &quot;I found my father and my grand mother! I found the dog I had loved as a child! It always troubled me that Rufus did not have a soul, and so should have perished utterly.&quot; The others were nodding. They too had met loved ones who had died.
&quot;Every living thing has a soul.&quot; Durathror observed. &quot;That soul does not die. It comes from god's kingdom, and when the body dies it passes back whence it came.&quot;
&quot;God marks the flight of the sparrow. Every living thing is important to him.&quot; I added, getting a feel for what had happened. Imladril had arranged for the puritans to have a religious experience that would help them stick with their new found compassion. All the puritans nodded at my words and those of Durathror.
The table grew larger to accommodate the rest us, and more chairs appeared. We seated ourselves and joined the conversation. Charles and Cromwell both seemed quite friendly toward one another, unlike when they were awake. They were engrossed in a discussion of the theological implications of what they had seen.
Matthew was declaring loudly that the good news should be proclaimed from the rooftops, and that puritans across the land would welcome the news.
Cromwell, being more politically astute, responded &quot;This good news might cause alarm to some of our less enlightened brethren. It must be couched in terms innocuous enough that it does not affront our supporters, yet the detail must be there for those who know.&quot;
I grinned &quot;Would you speak in parables Lord Cromwell? Give spiritual milk to spiritual babes, and spiritual meat to those who are more mature?&quot;
Cromwell nodded. &quot;I begin to appreciate Jesus' dilemma. He spoke in terms that would seem innocuous enough to pass by most listeners ears, but those who have ears would hear his true words. I wonder what else is hidden within his parables and other words, hidden yet by our ignorance. It has now dawned on me why you and the Viharani eat no flesh.&quot;
Charles asked &quot;Cromwell, something in your reasoning has passed over my head. How does what we have seen this night imply they should eat no meat?&quot;
A smile played across Cromwell's lips. &quot;Because your majesty, what we have seen shows us that animals such as cows an pigs and chickens and dogs and cats also have souls. If they have souls, then it may well be a sin to kill them for food. Or rather not so much a sin as undesirable, something that a crude and unspiritual man might do because he knows no better, but something from which someone who knows better should refrain.&quot;
Durathror commented &quot;The perils of knowledge, Lord Cromwell. When you know no better, you may be excused for performing some action. But once you have been shown, then you can no longer be excused.&quot;
&quot;But surely ignorance is no excuse!&quot; Matthew interjected. &quot;Certainly we do not allow ignorance of the law to excuse its breaking.&quot;
Cromwell shook his head. &quot;Even our lord himself, when nailed to the cross, asked &quot;Father forgive them for they know not what they do.&quot; Ignorance is an excuse, but the burden is upon those of us who do know better to set an example to the ignorant, and teach them when they are ready to learn. A man who will not learn, who turns his face away from the truth and the light, such a man may be condemned in his ignorance.&quot;
Durathror commented &quot;You English know the truth, but consider that your followers will not understand yet. You must set the example to the others, you can no longer claim ignorance as an excuse.&quot; The puritans nodded at this. Durathror observed cynically &quot;However, there is no pressing need for any others to know just yet. Especially since right now to declare truths such as animals have souls might cause you to be considered heretics. Instead, consider who understands well enough to share this, and we will show the truth to them as well. There is no need to rush this, rather take it steadily.&quot;
Cromwell nodded approvingly. Matthew griped &quot;I still mislike the idea that we cannot proclaim the truth...&quot;
&quot;But Jesus spoke in parables for just that reason.&quot; I interjected.
Matthew nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Yes, &quot;He who hath ears, let him hear.&quot; We had always thought the same truth should be given to all, but if the lord Jesus saw fit to hide some truths from the masses, then perhaps we should do well to emulate him.&quot;
Charles commented &quot;I mislike the idea of giving up meat. What is there to eat?&quot;
Imladril smiled &quot;Your majesty, do not attempt to do everything at once, or you will fail. Instead start gradually, and commence with eating less meat at a meal, and perhaps some meals without meat. But I think your chefs will need some instruction on how to prepare nourishing and delicious food that does not include meat. We can help there.&quot;
Durathror added &quot;My sister is right. Being spiritual should not be an onerous task. You have ingrained habits of a lifetime to break, and not all of you will be able to break them at once. God will be much happier if you start small, and advance slowly in the right direction, instead of bounding off rapidly, only to slide back all the time.&quot;
The king nodded. &quot;It hath sense. Often backsliding causes one to fall even further than one's starting point, so nothing has been gained, and much has been lost.&quot;
Cromwell commented &quot;It goes against the grain for me. When god has seen fit to vouchsafe me a truth, then must I pursue it with all my ardor. I cannot accept less from myself. But I think we should extend compassion to our brethren, and allow that if they set foot upon the path, then they need not follow it as swiftly as I. I find I must agree with you prince Durathror, that backsliding is to be avoided at all costs, even if it means proceeding more slowly than we might wish.&quot;
&quot;God will never give you a burden to heavy to carry.&quot; I observed. &quot;He sees into all our hearts, so as long as we do our best, he will be happy for each of us to proceed at our own pace.&quot;
&quot;You realize&quot; Cromwell intoned, &quot;that those words have implications of their own. There are many implications also in discovering that those who knew not Christ have not been condemned, but that their souls continue in the hereafter. Consider also...&quot;
At this point our discussion was interrupted. One of the guides, a two meter high truncated telegraph pole, materialized beside Imladril. &lt;&lt;May I have your attention.&gt;&gt; There was no voice, the words echoed directly inside my mind. &lt;&lt;Assassins and &lt;impression of orange spiky balls&gt; are making an attempt on the lives of some of you right now.&gt;&gt; Durathror winked out, followed an eyeblink later by Imladril, and about two blinks later again by Iskandor. It was not possible for the guide to show any expression, but it sounded a little flummoxed. &lt;&lt;Ohà erà perhaps the rest of you could follow me?&gt;&gt;
We gathered everyone else together. There was some consternation, but Cromwell merely shrugged. &quot;I have seen enough tonight that I no longer fear death. However, I take it that Prince Durathror has the matter in hand?&quot;
&quot;He and Imladril should be more than a match for any assassins even when those assassins have assistance from non physical beings.&quot; She checked that all of us were touching her or the guide, and then said &quot;Let's go.&quot;
Nalini and I, plus Prospero and Paula, did not need to hold on, but we did so as to be sure of arriving in the same place as the others. We arrived in our bedroom, hovering above our bodies sleeping in the bed. Two dark figures crouched by the window. There seemed something wrong with their bodies, as if they weren't quite human. I noted each body had a cord of light indicating that their dreaming bodies were elsewhere.
Ra'anor announced &quot;We stay here for now. The attackers are being rounded up.&quot;
I glanced at our sleeping bodies. Nalini was lying with one arm across my chest, her head half buried in the pillow. Our legs were entangled under the blankets. I felt a pang of love throb through me. The dreaming Nalini hovering beside me brought the back of my hand to her lips and kissed it.
Several of the others gathered around the unmoving figures crouched by the window. For some reason their details were not clear, as if there was a concealing spell about them.
&quot;They have an invisibility spell on them.&quot; Durathror remarked when he returned a few minutes later. &quot;There are six we believe. Two here, one more in king Charles' chamber, another in Cromwell's, one was found outside Prospero and Paula's room, and the sixth in Matthew's room. For the nonce I would suggest you not awaken, you will see things more clearly in this state. Iskandor is checking for others.&quot;
&quot;What of the orange sea urchins things?&quot; Nalini asked.
&quot;My sister has them in our net, we will deal with them in a few moments.&quot;
&quot;Are the assassins still alive?&quot; Paula asked.
&quot;Yes, though they are paralyzed and unconscious. You see those objects over there, the ones that look like a squid made of smoke?&quot; he gestured toward the center of the room, where two smoky shapes that resembled tubular bodies with tentacles hovered. They were surrounded by a golden glow.
&quot;You've imprisoned them?&quot; I observed.
&quot;Yes&quot; Durathror nodded. &quot;We wish to interrogate all of them. Ra'anor, do you take our guests to Imladril, I will follow with our prisoners.&quot;
She began shepherding all of us together. Cromwell was staring at the two of us hovering nearby, then at our physical bodies, and back again. &quot;That line of light you see is what tethers us to our physical bodies.&quot; I remarked. &quot;That is how you know whether something that appears to you in dreaming has a sleeping body somewhere.&quot;
He nodded, remarking &quot;It is a little unnerving to see you lying there as well as standing here. I am not used to these things.&quot;
&quot;Perish the thought Cromwell, but if things keep going on the way they are, you might just become used to these sort of sights.&quot;
&quot;I take it the evil one is bent on our destruction? I will fight him to my last breath!&quot; he declared fervently.
&quot;Someone or something is. I think we must wait until they have been interrogated.&quot;
Ra'anor led us not to the platform high among the trees, but to a place pink gravel and bone white bushes with spiny leaves. Nearby was a huge crystalline formation striated from layers of different colored crystals. Imladril was standing nearby, with a golden net in which seven orange spiky balls bounced around like mad, making sizzling noises.
Ra'anor explained &quot;This is the dreaming analogue of a place of power. We might need some assistance.&quot;
Imladril gestured. &quot;All of you, form a circle around me, about five meters away from me.&quot; We did as we were bid. It wasn't until then that I noticed two guides beside the net, and there seemed to be some form of energy exchange going on between the guides and the orange balls.
Durathror and Iskandor arrived a minute later, bearing between them another golden net with six of the squid like beings. These ones had lines of light, tethering them back to their bodies.
The interrogation was necessarily difficult since none of the beings possessed human thought patterns. The squid like beings remained haughtily defiant. They issued a single statement that might be paraphrased as &lt;&lt;Two legged demonspawn! Loathsome poisonous creatures, polluting world! Sacred duty is kill all!&gt;&gt; Their other thought patterns seemed to be mainly a jumble of images.
One of the guides explained &lt;&lt;To them, you are evil creatures that their god has condemned to be destroyed. They revile your gods as demons. They otherwise offer threats and defiance.&gt;&gt;
&quot;That's a bit steep!&quot; Charles exclaimed.
Matthew was somewhat harsher. &quot;They are fiends themselves!&quot;
Durathror commented &quot;We should not make threats. I wish to find out more about what they are doing and why.&quot; He turned back to the guide. &quot;What was their purpose when we apprehended them?&quot;
&lt;&lt;They sought to kill you all. They have been cloaked with an invisibility spell, and they bear poisoned fangs. One drop on the skin should be sufficient to kill a human.&gt;&gt;
&quot;Who provided them with the invisibility spell?&quot;
The guide was silent for a few moments, but we could sense a buzzing of thoughts. &lt;&lt;They say they were brought there by &lt;image of spiky orange balls&gt;. They believe they will be rewarded should they die performing their duty.&gt;&gt;
&quot;That is all? What can you add guide? Do they speak the truth?&quot;
&lt;&lt;In that they are like humans. They possess the ability to lie. However, I detect nothing to indicate they are lying.&gt;&gt;
&quot;Can you think of any reason why we should not simply return them whence they came?&quot;
&lt;&lt;Moving their physical bodies such a distance will be quite a drain. We will need your power to assist us.&gt;&gt;
Durathror smiled and nodded. &quot;Can they return, or do they need assistance? How did they get there in the first place?&quot;
The guide was silent again for a time. &lt;&lt;Their god moved them. They cannot return unless their god moves them again.&gt;&gt;
I realized by now that the guide would always answer a question truthfully, but would not volunteer information unless it was specifically requested. Durathror twirled his moustache thoughtfully. &quot;Tell us what you can of their god. Ask them what they know that you do not. How dangerous is their god to us? Why are they attacking us? What are they trying to achieve? Guide, find out everything you can from them, then tell us.&quot;
&lt;&lt;This may take a little while.&gt;&gt; The guide hovered there silently.
Durathror turned to the two guides hovering near the spiky orange balls, hissing and spitting inside their golden web. &quot;What can you tell me of these?&quot;
&lt;&lt;These are non corporeal beings from the fourth great band. They are quite inimical to humans, and to our kind as well. Were it not for their restraints, they would attempt to drain all of us. There are some here who are more susceptible to that.&gt;&gt;
&quot;What is the fourth great band? Why are they inimical to us?&quot; Rupert asked. Nalini and I thought a few more questions as the guide replied, which it picked up on as it replied.
&lt;&lt;The great bands are analogous to the seven colors you perceive&gt;&gt; one of the guides began. &lt;&lt;The human band is like the color red. All humans possess this color, most can never venture outside their band, their life force simply dissolves away. Where we are now is part of the human band, albeit it at the side closest to the band that belongs to &lt;image of orange spiky balls&gt;. To the best of our knowledge, there are forty nine great bands, but only seven are available to humans, and only one is their home. We are from another band that is accessible to humans. The &lt;image of orange spiky balls&gt; are from a band that is not accessible to humans except under extraordinary circumstances, and even then only for a short time. Danny and Nalini were drawn into that band and almost dissolved. We do not understand how they escaped, since their energy levels are such that they should have been trapped...&gt;&gt;
&quot;What do you mean by dissolved?&quot; Rupert interrupted.
&lt;&lt;Their life force is drawn from their spirits, and consumed by the &lt;image of orange spiky balls&gt;. They cease to exist. Complete and utter annihilation.&gt;&gt;
Cromwell quoted &quot;&quot;Do not fear death, but fear those who can destroy your immortal soul&quot; I had thought that was poetic, and that only god himself has the power to destroy souls. What manner of beings are these then?&quot;
&lt;&lt;They do not fit your theological view of the world. They are not demons as you would have them, but powerful beings in their own band. Out of their band, they have much less power. They are predatory beings. To them you are prey...&gt;&gt;
&quot;Like wolves you mean?&quot; one of the puritans asked.
&lt;&lt;The wolf kills to live. Do you regard the wolf as a demon? It has as much right to live as do you humans. The universe is a predatory world, where many being hunt down others. Beings from outside the human bands are inimical to humans by their very nature. Your energies attract predators, they seek you out to prey on you.&gt;&gt;
&quot;We do not deny the wolf the right to live&quot; Cromwell observed &quot;but rather when they attack our farms and villages we hunt them down and kill them. These&quot; his finger stabbed in the direction of the orange balls in their net of gold &quot;have crossed into our England, and hunt us. This we cannot allow!&quot;
&quot;True&quot; Durathror responded. &quot;But I seek to find out why they hunt us. This is no mere foray into the human realms. There is intelligence and purpose behind it. Guide, I know about these beings, and about the predatory nature of the world. Do you ask them why they attack us, and what they seek to accomplish.&quot;
&lt;&lt;They do not respond on this. They maintain that they are predators, we all are prey, and they do not have to explain their will to us. You will note that they include we guides with humans. However, we are more powerful than they are, we are in no danger. Might I just point out that we can protect all of you from beings like these, if you but say the word.&gt;&gt;
Durathror shook his head. &quot;Those of us you want have already made up their minds. The others have not the power, so do not tempt them.&quot;
&quot;What is this?&quot; Cromwell asked.
Durathror explained &quot;They can offer a place of safety in this predatory world, where no harm can befall us. But in return for that safety we must become their servants. Do not fear Cromwell, you do not have the power to attract them yet.&quot;
&quot;Do you mean serve as in human servants, or do you mean serve as in worshipping false gods?&quot; Cromwell asked.
&lt;&lt;We are not gods, we seek no worship.&gt;&gt; One of the guides responded. &lt;&lt;We have only your best interests at heart. We can offer you a place of safety in our realm, where none can harm you. But in return you must serve us. It is not onerous, your spirits will be free to explore the limits of existence, and discover knowledge.&gt;&gt;
&quot;What does this servitude involve?&quot; Cromwell asked. &quot;We'll have no truck with devils' pacts.&quot;
&quot;You would give up your free will.&quot; Durathror responded.
&quot;Then we should have nothing to do with these demons!&quot;
&lt;&lt;We seek nothing from you, Cromwell, and we make you no offer. As Durathror explained, you do not have the power to be with us. We seek such as Durathror, Danny and Nalini, but they have so far refused our offers. We are not demons, we are incapable of harming you.&gt;&gt;
&quot;Cromwell, the guides are friendly, in their own way. They do offer a place of safety, but we believe the price is too high. They are not demons, they have worked in human history to help humans. You know them as angels.&quot;
&quot;Angels? They? But...&quot; Cromwell began. The guide transformed into a beautiful androgynous angel, with white complexion, golden hair, and a white robe that was painful to look upon, so bright was it.
&lt;&lt;As such we have appeared in your history from time to time. We never harm humans, we only help.&gt;&gt;
&quot;And they have no free will. You should know this, lord Cromwell. They must do as god bids them. But everything is a test, or a lesson. And so when you are ready, you will be tested. However, this is side tracking us. I want to know why those beings tried to arrange our assassination.&quot;
&quot;Is there any way we can compel them to talk?&quot; Rupert asked.
&quot;Torture works well on humans.&quot; Charles observed.
&lt;&lt;They are non corporeal beings, they cannot feel pain.&gt;&gt; one of the guides responded.
Nalini and I were thinking about the time when we were attacked, and how we escaped. We both agreed we tapped into something vast and powerful. Whether it lay somewhere among the forces that powered the gems, or whether it lay somewhere deep in our own bond, we did not know, though we felt it lay deep within our bond. We shifted our shapes into the eagle headed man and the jaguar headed woman. The hissing and spitting grew more virulent.
&quot;They know us&quot; I said to the guide. &quot;Find out why they know us, and why they fear us.&quot;
There was silence from the guides for several minutes. Nalini and I linked minds, and tried to push our memories back to the time we had defeated our assailants. Somewhere deep within, under layers and layers, was some core that could tap into some vast power. However, this time it seemed to be eluding us.
&lt;&lt;You are the enemy. You summoned the eagle. You caused their compatriots to be unmade. They seek revenge.&gt;&gt; The guide paused
We drove the link deeper, becoming two halves of some greater whole. Was it simply this? But still the feeling eluded us. It was there, out of reach, buried.
The guide continued &lt;&lt;They believe you two are manifestations of The Eagle and The Jaguar, beings from the primary pattern. Of this we can see no evidence, except that you escaped from their trap.&gt;&gt;
Yes, that had to be the key. We began feeling the touch of their energies, the small amount that leaked out through the net. That energy was like a jagged blade upon a wound, like a piercing shriek, like fingernails dragged upon a blackboard. We almost cringed in horror at that touch. But deep within, something cold and alien looked back, peering through deep layers. A shudder passed through us as that something rose toward the surface, taking control.
&quot;Stop! Do not!&quot; Durathror thundered, but it was too late. The creatures swam before us, and some part of us was dimly aware we had somehow passed through the golden barrier. They swam around us, their energies was trying to flay the layers from us, to drain us and separate us, as they had before.
&lt;&lt;We are one! No power may separate us!&gt;&gt; that was the other part of the key. The pain was hideous enough to make us cringe, but that was now only part of what we were. To the other part the pain was a sensation, a guarantee that we lived. That part reached out to caress the orange balls, even though it felt like caressing a naked flame. They fled to the edges of their prison, frantic in their efforts to avoid our touch. That part of us informed them &lt;&lt;You are my prey, mine for the taking, when I choose. Tell your master I know his name. These are under my protection.&gt;&gt;
And then, like a sneeze, we retreated back amongst the others. The golden net and its contents winked out. Imladril stood looking directly at us, hands on hips, a shocked expression on her face. Durathror peered intently at both of us. He shook his head. &quot;What are you two? I saw when you vanquished the serpent god, there was something else that came to the fore. Those entities must be correct, you have some private link to the Eagle and the Jaguar. But beware!&quot; He shook his finger in our faces. &quot;What you did just then was reckless in the extreme. Do not count on the Eagle to save you every time! You do not have my skills or my powers, and it will take you hundreds of years to develop them.&quot;
Imladril added &quot;You could easily have been destroyed. That was like putting your arms into a tank with hungry sharks. I think we should explore this some other time, understand how it manifests, and what its limits are. Until we understand it, please keep it under control.&quot; She looked worried, as if she were a bit out of her depth by the events.
We nodded &quot;We won't let it happen again, unless we're attacked.&quot; We both replied.
Durathror commented &quot;They may have been prompted by what ever worked through them. We must keep an eye on them.&quot;
&quot;Just how did you make those beings vanish, and our net?&quot; Imladril asked.
That cold presence was gone, all that remained were memories of memories. &quot;We don't know, it just sort of happened.&quot; Some thoughts popped into our minds. &quot;The Serpent is behind tonight's attack. This is personal. It will not rest until we are destroyed. The Eagle has responded.&quot; We spoke together.
&quot;Hmmm. Be careful, it is a dangerous game you play. The more you draw attention to yourselves, the more you make it personal. The harder the Serpent tries, the more chance there is of something happening. We are not talking just physical death, we are talking the death of your souls. Very well, do you know whether they were the ones who tried to lead Cromwell and his friends astray earlier?&quot;
We didn't. Cromwell however nodded thoughtfully. &quot;These are the demons who masqueraded as our savior, and tried to convince us to pollute England with their foul ideas!&quot;
The guide corrected him. &lt;&lt;These ones are not the ones who appeared before you. Those ones were unmade by the Eagle acting through Danny and Nalini. These seek to avenge that destruction. It does seem that the Serpent has arranged this attack. You two will not be safe from them unless you join us. All you need do is request that aloud.&gt;&gt;
&quot;Sorry, we value our free will. The Eagle has promised to keep an eye on us.&quot;
Imladril sighed &quot;Well brother, that has resolved what to do with those entities.&quot;
Charles asked &quot;What are the Eagle and the Serpent? I take it you are not referring to animals. They sound positively pagan.&quot;
One of the guides answered pedantically &lt;&lt;They are the two godforms of archetype that gives rise to our set of shadows. They are also referred to as order and chaos...&gt;&gt;
&quot;Thank you guide.&quot; Durathror interrupted. I think Charles' eyes were glazing over. &quot;I think I should try to put this in terms they are more familiar with. The Serpent you should all know from your bible, it is the same that tempted Adam. The Eagle is its counterpart, something higher than an arch angel. They are less powerful than god almighty, but they are very powerful. Both are barred from the world of shadows which we inhabit, their very presence would distort and destroy. Instead they work through agents, human and other. We work on the side of the Eagle.&quot;
&quot;That is comforting to know!&quot; Cromwell exclaimed. &quot;But why can they not appear in our world, when the bible contains accounts of arch angels visiting us?&quot;
&quot;You are referring to arch angels. These are higher than that.&quot;
&quot;Higher than arch angels?&quot; Matthew exclaimed. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
&quot;They are definitely higher, though I am unsure what they might be called.&quot;
&quot;Archangels are pretty low in the scheme of things.&quot; I cut in. &quot;I recall reading that there are ten known levels, with archangels being the third lowest. The top levels are called...&quot; I paused for a moment, recalling. &quot;Dominions, Powers and Principalities, and I think Principalities are the highest. The Serpent is known as the Prince of Darkness because he is a fallen Principality.&quot;
Cromwell commented &quot;I believe blessed St Paul wrote that &quot;we fight against principalities and powers&quot;; that agrees with what you say. But what then is Michael? I am sure the bible refers to him as an archangel, yet he bested Lucifer and vanquished him from heaven.&quot;
&quot;I think that Michael was a commander in god's army, but not the commander in chief, and he did not personally beat Lucifer. Didn't Jesus say &quot;I saw Lucifer fall like a meteor from the heavens&quot;? I would guess that Jesus himself was the one who vanquished Lucifer. And didn't Gabriel tell Daniel that he and Michael were delayed by the Principality of Air?&quot;
Cromwell actually smiled as he nodded his agreement. &quot;I think that popular wisdom is not always right. What you say makes more sense.&quot; He turned to the other puritans. &quot;So my brethren, we fight against the devil himself and his minions! We must be very careful that we do what is right!&quot; He spoke slowly, emphasizing each word.
Durathror turned to the guide with the squid like beings. &quot;What have you discovered?&quot;
&lt;&lt;Little you do not already know. They volunteered for what might be termed sacred duty, were briefed to kill all creatures they encountered, and delivered within a heartbeat to the corridors outside the rooms in which you were sleeping.&gt;&gt;
&quot;Then let us return them to wherever they are from. Can you assist us in that? Their bodies must be transported, and then we can release their spirits. We will not kill them.&quot;
&lt;&lt;That is acceptable. You must remain here, and open the channels for us. My companions and I will perform the actual transportation.&gt;&gt;
Durathror, Imladril and Iskandor moved to the crystal formation. Durathror explained to us &quot;This is a power source to which all our torcs are linked. Or rather, it is the dreaming analogue of that power source. I am sure you understand that we do not need to be here to tap into the power from here, but the guides cannot tap into this unless they are here, and we open the channel for them.&quot;
&quot;Um.. I thought the guides were pretty powerful, so why do they need to tap in here?&quot; Paula asked.
&quot;They don't need to, they are perfectly capable of transporting those creatures home without assistance, but they won't expend their energy unless they are compensated. We do not possess sufficient power to journey to their realm, it would take us weeks of shifting if we wanted to walk there. That should tell you just how distant their realm is. Here we can supply the guides with the energies they want to transport these creatures themselves.&quot;
The three positioned themselves with their left hands on the crystal formation. At first nothing much seemed to be happening, but then I noticed swirls and vortexes forming on the outside of their auras. They extended their right hands, and a vortex formed just beyond each hand. The three guides positioned themselves inside these energy vortexes. The energy began to swirl around the black forms of the guides, flickering around them like flames.
Human auras are roughly egg shaped, and swirl with colors. Most humans have darkened colors reds, greens and grays. Sorcerers have brighter and clearer colors, and include yellows and blues. The guides on the other hand possess cylindrical auras of pale violet. The swirls of energy that were being channeled from the source were predominately blue-green, and formed a second cylinder around the outside of the guides' auras.
Suddenly the three guides winked out, although the energies were still being channeled into them - the streams seemed to stretch to infinity. A minute passed before the guides returned. They glided over to the golden web that surrounded the six smoky squid like forms, and seemed to absorb the gold. The freed spirits buzzed around like flies for a moment, then shot off into the distance.
In unison, Durathror, Iskandor and Imladril clenched their right fists, and the flow of energy shut off. They removed their left hands from the crystal formation, and then proceeded to shake their hands like you do when you have pins and needles.
&quot;Well, that's that&quot; Durathror announced. &quot;I wonder how much you English will remember tomorrow.&quot;
 The next morning Nalini and I felt a bit hung over - we had headaches, muscular and joint aches, and we felt woolly headed.
&quot;It must be last night's little run in with those orange beings&quot; Nalini opined.
&quot;I'm inclined to agree, but could it be flu? This place is terribly cold and draughty.&quot;
Nalini shook her head. &quot;I've been wearing my torc for almost twenty years. I stopped becoming sick after about the first six months. If it were only you who was sick, I'd say it was flu. See if you can fetch Fin's dagger.&quot; She was referring to the dagger given me by Fin mac Morn way back in my early shifting days. It had a gem in the hilt that tapped into some peculiar power sources, as did the gem in the ring she'd been given at the same time.
Fetching is similar to shadow shifting, except that instead of walking to where something is, you call it to you. It takes power, but fetching small items over short distances is easier than shifting, while fetching large items or over long distances is much harder than walking through shadow to them. The dagger was small, but quite distant, but since it had its own power source, it should be easier to fetch than almost anything else.
Except that this it proved quite difficult to contact it. I sat quietly, putting my aches and pains away from me, but finding it hard to sense through the cotton wool that seemed to surround me. Nalini had similar trouble with her ring, but after what seemed like ages it sat in the palm of her hand. It was a plain gold band set with a large faceted yellow gemstone. At first glance it looks to be colored glass, except that when you look into it, scintillating points of color swim within its depths.
She put it on her right hand and placed my left hand on top. &quot;Let me help lover.&quot;
I felt tingling warmth flowing up my left arm, and within seconds my head began to clear. I felt the dagger, and called it to me. The dagger sits in a worked sheath of black leather. It has a leaf shaped blade about twelve inches long and seems to be made of bronze, except that steel cannot scratch it. Its handle is horn, carved and bound with gold wire. The quillions are gold. In its pommel is set a large yellow gem, identical to that in Nalini's ring.
I left the dagger in its sheath, but held it in my right hand. Nalini took my right hand in her left. We went through the process of waking the lines of force, and let the energies flow into us and through us, from me to her and from her to me, circulating. Before the showdown with the Serpent there had been hundreds of lines of force, now there seemed to be only a few, but they were still sufficient. Our torcs don't seem to be able to give us the same pick up and healing that these gems can.
Eventually we felt our old selves again, and a little after that we washed, dressed and went downstairs for breakfast. Nalini wore her ring, I thrust my dagger into my boot.
With so many guests, the palace had departed from the normal procedure of feeding guests in the smaller breakfast room, and instead had fitted out the main dining hall. Its tables were quite long, and could easily fifteen or twenty people.
Almost all the other guests were already there. The puritans occupied three tables, though Cromwell, the Earl of Argyll and Matthew sat with the Viharani. In a departure from his usual practice, king Charles was also there, at the head of a table with King Amrik, Queen Enyil, Prince Rupert, Liz, Prospero and Paula.
Paula grinned at us. &quot;Gee, you two must have been having fun to be this late for breakfast.&quot; She was toying with some bread and jam.
&quot;Oh, I believe in starting the day with a bang!&quot; Nalini quipped back. &quot;Don't you?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, but Prospero likes his food more I think!&quot;
Amrik guffawed &quot;He likes them both! And food gives stamina for a repeat performance!&quot; He was halfway through a huge plate of bacon, eggs, sausages, slices of toast, plus what looked like sour kraut and Polish style pickled cucumbers.
&quot;I find it works up an appetite!&quot; I put in. &quot;What's to eat?&quot;
&quot;You can order almost anything, though you may have to wait while the chef cooks it&quot; Charles replied. His plate included mashed potato, a roasted bird of some kind, small enough for the entire bird to fit on the plate, as well as two pickled capsicums. There were more in a dish near by. A half eaten buttered bread roll sat on a side plate.
I thanked him, then added &quot;I didn't think that England went in for sour kraut, pickled capsicums and Polskie ogorkie?&quot;
He raised an eyebrow, but responded &quot;This is all my cousin Rupert's doing. He complained that honest English cooking lacked flavor, so he introduced some German staples. They have proved quite popular with some of my court.&quot;
Nalini meanwhile was talking with a liveried waiter. &quot;What have you to eat apart from meat and fried foods?&quot;
He ran through a list of things, many of them boiled.
Liz contributed &quot;They even have kippers! I've always wondered what they were like, they're quite good! Especially with those gerkins.&quot; She gestured with her fork at a bowl of pickled cucumbers. On her plate were two brown things that looked a bit like leather soles, I guessed they were kippers, along with mashed potato and several cucumbers.
&quot;I'm vegetarian, remember? I try to avoid eating flesh.&quot; Nalini flashed Liz a grin. &quot;Besides, kippers are salty, greasy and full of little bones. I can't stand them!&quot;
Liz nodded back, spoke through a mouthful of food. &quot;Yeah, that's probably why I like them! What they need is some good fried potato chips instead of mashed potato though.&quot;
Nalini shook her head. Rupert responded &quot;If you know how to make fried potato chips, we could have a word to the chef, and have him make you some.&quot;
&quot;Not this time, but maybe after breakfast I can tell him.&quot;
Prospero had several dishes of jam in front of him, as well as a dish of honey, another of curled butter shavings. &quot;The bread and jam is rather good Nalini. If you want some protein, they have several good cheeses I can recommend.&quot;
Nalini nodded. &quot;I think I'll settle for a selection of cheeses, some mashed potato, and a salad if you have any fresh vegetables that can be eaten raw. Have the chef mix up several spoons of olive oil, half that of lemon juice, a pinch of salt and one clove of chopped garlic and pour that over the salad. I don't suppose you have any chilies do you?&quot;
&quot;No ma'am, I don't think so, but I'll check.&quot;
&quot;It doesn't matter if you haven't. But if you do, have the chef slice a couple and put them in a side dish.&quot;
The waiter nodded, and turned to me. Nalini is more of a vegan than I am, I eat eggs, she doesn't. &quot;Scrambled eggs - two eggs, half a cup of grated tasty cheese, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, you do have that don't you?&quot; I knew they wouldn't have soy sauce. He nodded &quot;and a small amount of fresh onion, capsicum and tomato. Mashed potato on the side thanks, and some toast.&quot;
Nalini shook her head at me. &quot;They'll fry that in lard you know. It's very unhealthy!&quot;
&quot;But it tastes good!&quot; Amrik put in over a mouth full of food.
&quot;Are you saying the cheese is low fat? You'll probably have more fat in your cheese than I'll have in my eggs.&quot;
&quot;But at least mine won't be fried in lard! Yuck!&quot; she made a face.
A few minutes later the chef came out to talk to the two of us about what we wanted, and what he could provide. Low fat cooking was not a concept he had heard of, though he correctly surmised that boiling would be lower in fat than frying in lard. They also did not have any olive oil, or edible oil of any kind, and salad was a foreign term. The chef was humbly apologetic about all this.
&quot;What ever happened to our French chefs?&quot; Charles enquired.
It seemed the chef hadn't noticed the king until then. The poor chef was almost beside himself with fright. He stammered and stuttered, and bobbed about in an agony of cringing. We waited patiently while he got his words out. &quot;Th... th... the f... f... f... French sh... sh... sh... chefs all l.. l... left a... a... after... er... er...&quot; his voice trailed off.
&quot;After what man? Speak up.&quot; the king's voice was kindly.
&quot;After Cromwell, I mean the lord Protector er... er... you... sire.&quot; His voice was squeaky with embarrassment.
&quot;After Cromwell had us arrested?&quot;
The chef's head nodded vigorously.
&quot;Very good, you may go.&quot; The chef fled back to the safety of the kitchen. Charles observed to the rest of us &quot;We will have to set things in order as soon as our restoration is declared valid.&quot; He sighed, and dropped the royal 'we'. &quot;I am impatient for this sorry affair to be finished, and to get on with the business of governing England. Dealing with parliament is so frustrating!&quot;
Prospero responded &quot;Not all of them have seen the error of their ways yet, but Prince Durathror has assured me that he will have them eating out of his hand before much longer.&quot;
&quot;I wish I possessed his powers&quot; Charles replied. &quot;Cromwell and his cronies are as stubborn as oxen and as dangerous as wild boar.&quot;
Amrik chuckled. &quot;We're bringing in a parliament to help me in dealing with the nobles. Many's the time I've felt the urge to shorten a few of their necks! With the new parliament in place, they will find the curb bit in their mouths.&quot;
Charles nodded. &quot;I've felt the urge to remove a few heads from shoulders. It would make the others wondrously obedient.&quot; He smiled. &quot;The new parliament will be less powerful than the old, but the monarch will also have fewer powers. I am not convinced it will all work.&quot;
Amrik agreed. &quot;It should stop situation like that which lead to your civil war from arising. But I have also decided to learn what the Viharani will teach me. You should probably do likewise.&quot;
&quot;Queen Imladril and Prince Durathror have promised to teach me, but I am not sure if I want to learn. Last night made me realize that such knowledge is dangerous.&quot;
&quot;I missed the fun and games. But consider this: those creatures were directing Cromwell and his friends. Without knowledge of sorcery you would now be dead. Once I swore I would have no truck with sorcerers, but I owe my life to Danny, Nalini and Durathror. I now believe it is like learning to use a sword. Certainly you can be killed or injured using one, but as a king you will be put in situations where you could be killed or injured if you do not have this knowledge. I speak now as one king to another: being king is dangerous, I believe we should take all steps we can to safeguard ourselves.&quot;
Charles stroked his beard. &quot;Do not say the word sorcery in the hearing of any puritan, they will claim your head.&quot;
Amrik grinned ferociously. &quot;Then I will make them work for it! I am not called the Bull for nothing! The dogs would be gored and trampled.&quot;
&quot;I believe you, king Amrik. But now let me advise you: enough dogs can bring down the strongest bull or bear.&quot;
Amrik grunted and smiled ruefully. &quot;I take your point, king Charles.&quot;
Charles looked at Amrik for a long moment before he continued. He seemed to be thinking. &quot;I am able to recall much of what transpired last night. I had forgotten those creatures were pulling Cromwell's strings like a puppet master. Incidents like this will continue to happen, whether I learn or not. That is a very apt analogy, king Amrik. I may not be the world's best swordsman, but I can give a good account of myself if I must. Just as it be prudent to learn the art of fencing, so it also be prudent to learn the arts and knowledge of the Viharani.&quot; He sighed and smiled. &quot;Once I believed that god in his heaven ordered the world, and would look after my welfare as his representative on earth. Now I have learned that God helps those who help themselves. He may even have organized you to rescue me, and open my eyes to the plans of the evil one. I must ask Prince Durathror how we can protect ourselves from further occurrences.&quot;
Enyil responded &quot;Your majesty, what has happened here in recent years is like a festering sore. It must be opened, and the putrid flesh scraped out if it is to heal. Prince Durathror has excised much that is putrid, but we must continue to dig until we find the source of the disease, and remove that. He is sure that things will come to a head sometime in the next few days.&quot;
Amrik gleamed wolfishly. &quot;I chafe at sitting here waiting for something to happen. The prospect of action makes me happier!&quot;
Charles added &quot;I pray that this is settled soon. One thing puzzles me though. I thought I understood where Cromwell and his cronies stood in this matter, but now I have discovered they are puppets dancing to someone else's tune. I find that threatening, especially since I do not understand what all these sinister creatures are about. Could one of you be so good as to explain things to me?&quot;
I think we all looked to Enyil. She smiled. &quot;I will try to explain things, though I may not always be familiar with terms that you use. There are many non physical being about. By this I mean they do not posses a physical body like we do. A great many are like wild beasts or perhaps monkeys, they can cause trouble, but is a passing thing. Others however are more like humans, they have intelligence, they form intent, they plan and follow through. They are not demons, rather they are capable of both good and evil, it is an individual choice. Some, such as those orange puffballs, are antagonistic to humans, and seek to harm them. Do not you humans do the same with different nationalities and religions?&quot;
&quot;We are trying to move beyond that&quot; I responded.
Enyil nodded. &quot;I was referring to the situation here in England.&quot;
Charles answered &quot;I must agree with earl Daniel. We are endeavoring to move beyond those base motives. However, the Spanish have a penchant for harming anyone who is not a catholic of the Spanish persuasion, and our puritans would perform the same service for any who are not of the puritan persuasion. But I take your point, these creatures are like humans, they form factions, and seek to harm those whom they regard as enemies.&quot;
Enyil nodded again. &quot;None of us are sure what they hoped to achieve with their influence of Cromwell, but that appears to be more organized than is usual. Those orange puffballs do not possess the power to shift physical objects through shadow without help. Durathror believes the first attack on Danny and Nalini is related to what ever they were doing with Cromwell and the other puritans. After all, we interrupted their plans. Last night appeared to involve the same group, although there is another shadowy presence implicated.&quot;
&quot;Is that the Serpent?&quot;
Enyil looked at Nalini. &quot;I will get to that. Durathror is sure that there is something sinister behind what happened with Cromwell and the other puritans. We know that there are groups of powerful entities who delight in causing pain and suffering to humans. Their modus operandi is to generate a fanatical following for some leader, and then use that following to destroy all who are different. The result is war, and genocide of all who are different. Once that has happened, the fanatics turn upon themselves and destroy one another. Sometimes the sinister being will incarnate to give better expression to its desires. Normally however, they are incapable of donning human flesh, and must work through human agents.&quot;
&quot;Would they be fallen angels, demigods or what? Would someone like Hitler be one of them, or a protege?&quot;
&quot;That's a good question Danny. Terms like gods, demigods, fallen angels, demons and the like are human terms, they do not adequately reflect what is out there. These beings are predatory, and humans are but one of their quarries. Hitler may have been an incarnated one, but more likely he was a prot_g_. These sinister beings would develop new Hitlers where ever they work their wills. Durathror has pledged to stop these beings where ever he encounters them. He will stop these ones too. Now this brings me to last night. These creatures don't often recognize individual humans, we all look the same to them. Cromwell and a few others are obviously the exception there. However, someone recognized Danny and Nalini, and set about doing something to stop you, and your companions.&quot;
&quot;It's the serpent behind it somehow. We knew that when we dealt with them last night.&quot;
Enyil nodded slowly. &quot;It's our guess that the serpent has some interest in the arrangement they made for Cromwell. We hope it is only slight, otherwise it could be difficult. You two made yourselves known to the serpent when you summoned the Eagle to deal with the beings that were trying to destroy you. If we keep both of you out of any action that arises, then you will drop from his view again. Durathror feels that the serpent will make another attempt soon, but if that is thwarted then he will lose interest.&quot;
&quot;How do we achieve that? It sounds as if there is some danger.&quot;
She gave a half smile. &quot;We advise you two not to summon the Eagle unless you have no choice. The other matter is that if you open the links to the gems in your ring and dagger, you will make those gems known to interested beings. There are many who would seek to wrest them from you. But it works both ways. Others can track you, but so can the Eagle, so while you are calling attention to yourselves, you are also ensuring that the Eagle watches.&quot;
Nalini and I looked at one another. We had a quick mental exchange, then we nodded, and closed down the links to our gems. I suppose it was like clearing the firing chamber of a gun: there would be extra steps required to ready it for use, but it was still a reassuring presence.
Charles asked &quot;Is it dangerous for the rest of us? Those creatures were trying to assassinate me and several others.&quot;
&quot;It could be dangerous until we finish this. The thing to remember is that these creatures do not think like humans, they do not have human motives or human reactions. You and Cromwell are among those they have marked, and it appears they want you dead. Durathror has decided that there should always be one of the Viharani with those who are marked. We are much more capable of dealing with these threats. Other than that, life should go on as normal.&quot;
Charles actually managed a smile. &quot;Well, we all must die, 'tis but a question of when and how. I will not go in fear, though an elfin bodyguard seems a sensible precaution. Does Cromwell know of this?&quot;
&quot;Durathror has been explaining things to the puritans this morning. We think they are only just realizing that in their terms they have made a deal with their devil. Once they are convinced of that, they will let nothing stop them from implementing your agreement. There is much harm they must also undo.&quot;
Amrik added &quot;We plan to leave the puritans to Durathror's tender mercies today and do some sight seeing. My attention span has a limit when it comes to parliamentary debate. I tend to tell them what I want, and to get back to me if they have any problems.&quot;
Charles laughed. &quot;I tried that, and look where it got me!&quot;
&quot;Where were you planning on sightseeing?&quot;
&quot;Oh just around the city of London. Would any of you like to join us? I am sure it would be more fun with the rest of you.&quot;
We agreed, as did Prospero, Paula and Liz. Rupert said to Charles &quot;With you permission, your majesty?&quot;
Charles waved his hand airily. &quot;Go ahead. I am sure I can dispense with you company for the day.&quot;
&quot;Does this mean you're not coming with us?&quot;
Charles looked at Amrik in surprise. &quot;My dear king Amrik, I should be recognized! I would like to come, but it is not possible.&quot;
Enyil smiled at him. &quot;King Charles, would you come if we could alter your appearance so that not even your mother could recognize you? Amrik does this all the time back home when he wants to escape the pressures of being king.&quot;
Amrik added &quot;I enjoy becoming an ordinary man and walking the streets incognito. Being a king is so stifling.&quot;
Charles stroked his beard in thought a moment, then replied &quot;If you can render me unrecognizable, then I shall join you. I must confess the freedom I had while in Aquilonia has made me realize how circumscribed my life in England is.&quot;
 And so it came to pass that we headed off to London an hour and a half later. Most of us were dressed for shadow walking, but minus our large packs. Nalini and I carried day packs instead. I wore my sword slung across my back, its hilt projecting over my right shoulder, my dagger in a sheath at my left hip and a pistol in a belt holster on my right. Nalini wore similar weapons, although her knife was plainer than mine. We tend to think alike these days. Paula wore only a gun and knife, she doesn't like swords. Liz at this stage had no real skill with weapons, though she had proven she could shoot. We let her wear a gun, and told her to wear a knife. Prospero wore his sword at his hip; he grew up wearing swords and does not find them awkward to wear at the hip. He also wore a gun on his right hip. Amrik wore his huge black broadsword at his hip, and a knife at his right hip. There were also a couple of daggers peeping from his boot tops. Enyil wore a long bladed knife and no other apparent weapons. All of us wore jerkins of ceramic mail underneath our outer clothing. Prince Rupert wore his saber, and was dressed as a gentleman-soldier. This meant richly but plainly. King Charles wore a rapier at his hip, and was dressed more as a gentleman with doublet and baggy trews. He wore knee high boots with bucket tops, and carried a cane with a silver knob. I thought he looked like one of the three musketeers.
We walked some distance away from the manor into some nearby woods before Enyil worked her magic on Rupert and Charles. We did not want any observers. She made Rupert's hair seem black instead of blond. His face was not too well known, we presumed he would not be identified. Charles however was well known, his head was on most coins. Enyil made his hair seem blond and curly with a touch of gray, and his face broader and less refined.
&quot;How ever did you manage that!&quot; Charles exclaimed as he studied himself in the mirror. &quot;Is it permanent, or will I revert?&quot;
&quot;It is a simple illusion, your majesty, and will wear off within twelve hours if not renewed. There are no physical changes to your body, only to what people will see.&quot;
&quot;That is a relief, though now that I think upon it, it might be an advantage to be able to appear younger.&quot; He smiled.
&quot;Ah, the appearance of youth without the vigor to back it would soon pall, your majesty. Better for you to learn about power, and make yourself grow younger. However, if you wish to appear younger...&quot; His image blurred briefly, when it came back into focus twenty years had dropped from his face.
&quot;Now that is truly miraculous!&quot;
&quot;As I warned your majesty, you still have the mannerisms of a man of middle age, and your choice of words and their cadence will give you away to those who know. And do not forget that though you may look like a twenty year old, your body is still middle aged. If you walk the path of knowledge, you will knowledge is power, and power can restore your youth.&quot;
Charles' smile slipped slightly. &quot;Many a man would sell his very soul to regain his youth. I am advanced enough in years to know I would prefer a youthful body to the one I bear, but I will not sell my soul.&quot;
Enyil smiled and shook her head. &quot;The path of knowledge is a path with a heart, the path of life. It will not imperil your soul, nor require you to make pacts with demons. But it will require your dedication if you wish to progress. But consider this: those beings with whom Cromwell had dealings have endangered his soul and yours. You are not safe until this matter is settled.&quot;
Charles' face became somber. &quot;Your majesty, that thought does disquieten me. I would rather none of this had ever happened.&quot;
&quot;We can never go back to what might have been. Always we must start from where we are, and make the most of the situation in which we find ourselves. Each day is a new beginning, we rise from our dreams born anew. Never lose hope king Charles, for our disquiets can be dealt with as long as we have hope.&quot;
Amrik clapped Charles on the shoulder causing him to stagger. &quot;Don't worry lad, we've beaten gods and demons before. We won't let them get you. Shall we start for London?&quot;
London wasn't really that far, especially when Enyil lead us through shadow. She led us out of the trees, across a field and down a country lane. A few shifts and we were entering the outskirts of a city. Armed men on horseback milled around the streets, but Enyil worked some sorcery, and they ignored us. We walked briefly down a cobbled street under a shower of rain, and then shifted back into typical London overcast. We shifted once more, and there ahead was the Tower of London, situated near the banks of the River Themes.
In this age the tower was still a working prison, used to incarcerate political prisoners (read nobles) who were not in accord with the government of the day. Yeomen in bright red livery, with shiny breastplates, halberds and hats, marched around keeping guard.
&quot;Would they be Beefeaters?&quot; Nalini asked, pronouncing it bee-feeters.
&quot;I believe the tower guards are known by that name.&quot; Charles replied.
&quot;Why are they called bee-feeters?&quot; Prospero asked.
&quot;Because my predecessor Henry the eighth wanted to ensure that the Palace guards were big, strong and healthy. He assigned them a ration of beef to be eaten every day, hence the name &quot;beef eaters&quot;. I believe that many of the poorer people still do not eat meat every day.&quot;
Prospero laughed &quot;And I thought it was some arcane term for special soldiers!&quot;
&quot;Well, they are, aren't they? They receive special rations!&quot; Amrik countered.
 We acted as tourists, and went sight seeing around London. King Charles seemed quite happy to act as tour guide, there were times when he seemed to take an almost boyish pleasure in being able to walk the streets of London unrecognized.
London itself was quite different from the several Londons with which Nalini and I were familiar. This London had another twenty two years to wait before the great fire would destroy much of its heart. Many buildings had not yet been built. The houses of parliament and Big Ben did not exist; St. Paul's Cathedral was an old and rather ramshackle building, parts of which dated from Norman times. The city was a good deal smaller, and had not fully swallowed the once separate city of Westminster.
Nalini and I made public comment on this, much to the dismay of Charles and Rupert. &quot;You speak as if the future were an open book to you!&quot; Charles complained.
&quot;Not quite, but where we come from, the civil war continued until 1649, when you were beheaded.&quot; Liz observed. Charles shuddered.
&quot;We've averted that&quot; Nalini added &quot;But unless you do something about the fire hazards around here, you'll find yourself living through the great fire in 1666.&quot;
&quot;Then you must tell us what we should do to avert this tragedy.&quot; Charles asked.
&quot;You should clean up the rats first, because the fire is the only thing that stopped the Black Death.&quot; Liz commented.
Nalini added &quot;The plague is caused by dirt, and carried by fleas and rats. You'll have the plague in another eighteen years if you don't clean up the city.&quot;
Rupert and Charles looked at one another. &quot;Cousin&quot; Rupert observed &quot;I think you would agree that London is much dirtier than Tarantia.&quot; We had agreed to dispense with any titles during our walk, but Rupert could not bring himself to call his king by his first name.
Charles surveyed the streets around. The one we strode was cobbled, but cross streets were muddy and rutted dirt. Garbage and refuse was piled everywhere, sometimes blocking smaller streets completely. People still discarded the contents of their chamber pots into the street, to the danger of passers by. Streets used by animal traffic were also strewn with droppings and urine. Rats scurried everywhere.
&quot;Prospero did comment on the need for cleanliness to prevent disease. If it be eighteen years away, think you we have time to avert it?&quot;
&quot;You have time, but measures must be introduced and strictly enforced. This city must become as clean as Tarantia if you wish to avoid the plague. The fire may be harder to avoid, for you must tear down many old buildings, widen streets to make gaps the fire cannot jump across. We're not experts on fire prevention, but we could come back in a few months and write up some guidelines.&quot;
As we walked, we were heading toward some of the seedier areas. Liz asked &quot;Is it safe for us to go there?&quot;
Amrik laughed. &quot;Lass, there are thieves and cutthroats in every city, but none would think to attack nine such as us. We are armed and dangerous, they would rather pick a man alone where the odds are in their favor.&quot;
We stopped off at a tavern nearby for a drink. Charles looked around with interest, and I gathered this was the first time he'd walked into a pub such as this. Silence descended as we entered, but the noise picked up again once people realized we were not after anyone. Amrik called out in heavy English &quot;Ho! Ale for all of us!&quot;
Prospero added &quot;And two jugs of wine!&quot;
There weren't enough seats for all of us to sit together. Amrik selected one table that was mostly vacant, and sat beside two weasily looking men. He unslung his broadsword, pushed the blade partly out of the sheath, and laid in on the table with the hilt to his hand. &quot;Don't mind me boys!&quot; he said to the two unsavory characters.
They looked at him, noted his bulging muscles, plus the fact that the rest of us were preparing to seat ourselves beside him. &quot;It's all right, we'll move.&quot; They collected their beers and sat at a nearby table where there were three spare seats.
The others sat. There was room for six, or eight if we squeezed. but not nine. Nalini and I sat on a vacant bench at the next table. &quot;'Ere! That seat's taken!&quot; growled an evil looking character seated on the other side of the table. His hair was matted and unkempt, his face greasy, his beard strewn with relics from past meals. In true boys own adventure story tradition, his face was crossed by several scars. His body had the look of hard muscle now going to fat and drink. His three companions looked just as unsavory.
The civilized part of me was ready to apologize and move on, except that there wasn't anywhere else to move, unless we ousted the two weasily people from their seats.
&lt;&lt;I hate situations like this!&gt;&gt; I thought to Nalini.
&lt;&lt;If it were just us two, we'd move. I hate this too.&gt;&gt;
Aloud I asked &quot;What, the whole bench? There's room for four here. I don't see any tankards on this side.&quot;
&quot;You callin' me a liar?&quot; He glared at me.
&quot;No, but we'll just sit here until your friends return.&quot; I replied brightly with a confidence I did not really feel. &quot;There might be other seats vacant by then.&quot; We sat, and turned partly to face our friends. Neither of us wanted to turn our backs on them completely. Both of us reached up almost in unison and loosened our swords for easy drawing. The two I was watching out of the corner of my eye seemed taken aback by our movements. I don't think they'd noticed the swords before, perhaps because they expected us to wear them at our waists.
Nalini tossed a gold coin onto the table. &quot;Here, we don't mean to inconvenience you. Buy yourselves a beer on us.&quot; Here voice had that unmistakable tone an English lady uses when speaking with those of the lower classes - one that expects instant obedience, one that brooks no nonsense, but at the same time is attempting to be fair and reasonable.
Two of his friends stared at the coin as if it were a snake about to strike. The third exclaimed an oath followed by &quot;A painted woman! With a sword!&quot; as if he had only just realized that Nalini had dark skin.
The first man looked at the two of us with an odd look on his face, then his hand flashed out and made the coin vanish. &quot;Thankee your ladyship. Canst use yon sword?&quot;
&quot;Yes my good man, I most certainly can. I've killed quite a few men too.&quot;
I looked at him steadily, and nodded slowly, smiling a businesslike grimace. Nalini suddenly reached up and drew her sword in a practiced movement, one of those lightening draws designed to parry an opponent's sword while drawing, and remove the opponent's head in the same movement. She didn't follow through, there wasn't room here. Two of the men started belatedly. &quot;As you boys can see, this sword has been used many times.&quot; She lowered it carefully, edge upwards, pointing across the table.
One of the men who'd started licked his lips as if he were scared. The spokesman looked at the blade, nodded. A sword that's been used has little nicks and notches in the cutting edge. Nalini's has such telltale signs. &quot;That's an unusual blade ma'am. What're those wavy lines along the edge?&quot; I wouldn't say his tone was respectful, but it had changed in that direction, as if he'd decided we might just be dangerous.
&quot;It's to do with the tempering...&quot; she looked at me.
&quot;They pack the back of the blade in clay for its quenching, with only the edge sticking out. When they quench it, the edge cools rapidly, and becomes very hard, while the back cools more slowly, and has more spring. The wavy pattern is where the clay finished.&quot; I added. Nalini lifted her sword and sheathed it.
Amrik called across the room in heavy English &quot;It can take head from bull in one stroke. Good lady's weapon. Is too light for me. I like something bigger!&quot; He waved his sheathed broadsword around in his left hand, making it seem light as a feather.
Amrik's muscular bulk means he looms over people even when seated. The evil looking man gave Amrik an appraising glance, obviously deciding it was in his best interests to be friendly. &quot;So we can see. I don't think our friends are coming. Feel free to use the seats.&quot;
Our wine and beer arrived. Amrik drank, made a face, but continued until he had drained his tankard. Prospero drank, then exclaimed &quot;Faugh! The beer's warm!&quot;
&quot;Hah!&quot; I laughed. &quot;And the red wine is cold! Welcome to ye old English pub.&quot;
Prospero tested the wine, then looked stricken. &quot;Tasteless food, warm beer, cold red wine! What else will they think of?&quot;
Amrik patted his hand. &quot;Drink your beer before it gets cold!&quot;
 Our day was largely uneventful. Amrik was sure that some ruffians were following us around, attracted by the gold coin Nalini threw on the table as a promise of rich pickings. Our weapons however were a promise of a hard fight should they attack, and so nothing eventuated.
Somewhat later, walking along the Strand, the riverside street which connects London proper with Westminster, and where there were more well to do people, Charles was jostled by someone. Amrik spun and grabbed a small boy, hoisting him into the air by one arm. The boy screamed and kicked, but Amrik seemed impervious. &quot;Charles, I believe this is your purse?&quot; Clutched in the hand that Amrik held was a leather coin purse.
Charles patted his clothing, then exclaimed &quot;Why, so it is! The little devil!&quot;
Amrik retrieved the purse and handed it back. &quot;He has three accomplices standing around us. Be prepared!&quot; He indicated two men in their thirties and a slatternly looking woman approaching middle age. The woman was holding a grubby shawl around her shoulders, the two men were standing about three meters apart. The looked angry, but were obviously not wishing to tackle our numbers.
Amrik handed the urchin to Enyil, then like a striking panther leapt and seized the two men. One drew a knife, but Amrik shifted his grip to the man's wrist, crushing it in steely fingers. The knife clattered loudly on the cobbles. Prospero grabbed the women as she started to run away. I took the second man's arm and twisted it into a lock, relieving Amrik of the trouble of trying to control the two single handedly.
&quot;Your luck's run out lads.&quot; Amrik growled at the two men. &quot;I should break your neck for trying to stab me&quot; he twisted the man's wrist in emphasis, producing a grimace and a groan from his captive.
&quot;Spare us, yer lordship! Spare us!&quot; the woman wailed, turning on tears. &quot;We've sick children to feed, an' we can't get no work with the war an all!&quot;
&quot;I doubt you've done an honest days work in your lives!&quot;
Charles ventured &quot;We should hand them over to the authorities!&quot;
&quot;So we should, but then we'll just have to hang around while a judge hears our story.&quot; He turned back to the man he held, and shoved his face close. &quot;Right! If I catch you trying this again I'll break your neck! Understand?&quot; The man wouldn't have understood the Aquilonian, but the translation spell rendered the words into his own brand of English. He nodded wordlessly. Amrik released him. &quot;Run!&quot; The man took off like a startled rabbit.
Amrik turned to the man I held, grasped him by the scruff of the neck, hoisted him from the ground, and shook him like a doll. Then he held the man's face close, repeated what he'd said to the other man, and dropped him onto the cobbles. The man sprang to his feet and ran off after his companion.
Amrik turned to the woman Prospero held, and said &quot;I don't usually hit women, but I you try your pick-pocketing on me again I'll knock all your teeth out! Is that clear?&quot;
&quot;Wha.. what about me boy?&quot; she stammered.
Amrik snorted. &quot;He's too clumsy to be a thief. Have him taught an honest trade. Now be off with you!&quot;
She wailed and retreated. Her two male companions sidled from the passers by to comfort her. Amrik turned to the boy, who was squirming and swearing at Enyil. &quot;Im not scared of you, ya big bully!&quot; he screamed at Amrik.
Amrik chuckled, then became suddenly gruff. &quot;No? Well maybe I should thrash you with my belt? Teach you proper respect for your elders and betters. The gods know your parents haven't taught you.&quot;
The kid turned sullen. He was probably no more than nine or ten. His face was grimy, his hair greasy and unkempt, and like his relatives, he smelled abominably.
Enyil commented &quot;I think he's been thrashed too often. It probably won't make much difference to him. Let me deal with him.&quot;
Amrik raised an eyebrow, but smiled. &quot;As you wish.&quot;
Enyil turned to the sullen boy. &quot;You have the manners of a toad, and you smell like a goat. We intend to put a stop to your career as a pickpocket and thief...&quot;
&quot;Cut his hands off, that will stop him stealing!&quot; Amrik interjected. Charles gasped, Amrik winked at him. &quot;Prospero, do you hold the lad's arms!&quot; Prospero grabbed the boy's arms while Amrik drew his sword slowly.
The boy's mother shrieked and threw herself at his feet imploringly. The boy turned suddenly pale. Enyil held up one hand &quot;No, I think I'll just turn him into a toad!&quot; She waved her hand in a flourish, and where the boy stood was a large and warty toad, about the size of a medium dog. &quot;Boy, you will stay like that until you learn that it is wrong to steal. Woman!&quot; she raised the weeping woman's chin. &quot;It will wear off, but should he return to theivery, he will turn back into a toad, is that clear?&quot;
The woman stared in shock at the toad, then began to shriek. Exasperated, Enyil exclaimed &quot;You shall join him!&quot; The woman's form flickered, and in her place was another toad. Amrik stamped his foot as if to step on them, and the two toads fell over themselves getting out of the way of his boots.
Charles and Rupert were also standing there with shocked expressions on their faces. &quot;How did you?...&quot; Charles managed.
Enyil smiled at him. &quot;The same way I changed your appearance. It will wear off in a few hours, but in the meantime they will think they are toads. I will warrant they will not return to the trade of thief.&quot;
We continued on our way. When I looked behind us, the two men were standing near on the river side, staring at the two toads. With the current social attitudes about witchcraft, I doubted they would tell anyone what they had experienced.
We returned later that evening to Hampton Court palace, walking out of the woods at the same place where we had entered that morning. Two men at arms were stationed on the path near where we emerged. Charles and Rupert were now back in their original forms, and as soon as the men recognized the monarch, one balled out in the direction of the palace &quot;Ho! They're back! The king has returned!&quot;
&quot;Rupert, be a good chap and find out what all the fuss is about!&quot; Charles ordered.
&quot;Oh, there's been a right to-do here today, hasn't there Bill?&quot; one of the men at arms replied.
&quot;That there has been, John&quot; the other replied. &quot;The uh... parliamentarians made a right fuss this morning. Some of 'em claimed the devil himself came to visit!&quot;
&quot;Doan surprise me! I reckon they be serving that there devil, an' not god&quot; his companion observed. &quot;Then they done realized yer majesty had disappeared, and they was buzzing around like flies round a piece of er.. dung, begin' your pardon lords and ladies...&quot;
Charles tried to suppress a smile at this. &quot;I see. Well we had best make our way to the palace, and investigate this matter.&quot;
An honor guard met us partway to the palace, along with several obsequious courtiers, Durathror, Cromwell and a couple of other puritans. We exchanged greetings. Charles asked &quot;Prince Durathror, I have heard reports that you have had an eventful day?&quot;
&quot;Yes, you could say that your majesty. We had some rather odd characters appear.&quot;
&quot;Odd!&quot; Cromwell exclaimed. &quot;I thought we English practiced the art of understatement. We had a dozen demons come to claim our souls! That is somewhat beyond odd I should think.&quot;
Durathror smiled. &quot;True, but let us go inside, allow the king and his party to refresh themselves, and then we can brief them.&quot;
He didn't seem at all disturbed, giving me the sneaking feeling that he or one of the other Viharani were behind what ever had happened today.
A little later we sat in the main dining hall, with plates of fruits and pastries, flasks of wine, water and carafs of steaming black coffee.
Cromwell began &quot;We were here, having lunch, when a dozen demons appeared over by the sideboard. They were tall and hideous, having the grotesque aspect of part man, part insect.&quot;
Durathror added &quot;They were the orange sea-urchin creatures as Nalini calls them. Being spirits, they cannot harm us while we are flesh. So they took on the aspects as Cromwell described, spindly insectoid bodies, armored against our weapons.&quot;
Cromwell continued &quot;They had hideous looking faces! All bristles, and jaws that projected like a wolf's, except that they were sideways!&quot;
Durathror explained &quot;They had semi human faces, but their jaws worked like those of insects, opening sideways rather than up and down. They sought to eat our flesh.&quot;
&quot;Would they not have stolen our souls as well?&quot; &quot;Cromwell demanded.
&quot;That they would have, once they had devoured our flesh. We&quot; Durathror emphasized the 'we' &quot;have signed no pact with them, they must first eat our flesh if they would have our souls. I am not so sure about you puritans, it may well be that in your dreams you signed a pact with them.&quot;
&quot;Humph! We have been through this before. How would we know? Many of us can scare remember that we dreamed, let alone what we dreamed!&quot;
&quot;Yes, we have. But you do remember something of the dreams wherein they masqueraded as Jesus and his desciples, and caused you puritans to fawn upon them, and fall into error. Mayhap you signed a pact with them in return for earthly power such as you now have.&quot;
&quot;How did you get rid of them?&quot; Amrik asked.
&quot;What is to be done if they have signed a pact?&quot; Charles asked.
Durathror smiled. &quot;The puritans showed their true mettle. Most fled and hid beneath the tables, several jumped through the window which is now boarded up, while a few like Cromwell stood their ground and defied them.&quot;
Cromwell looked grim. &quot;Some of us attacked with swords and pistols, but to no avail. They ate several guards before prince Durathror bade them retreat. Then prince Durathror and I stood before them and cursed them by the mighty names of God, and bade them depart whence they came. That proved effective, for after some dispute, they became like smoke and vanished.&quot;
Durathror nodded. &quot;You did well to defy them, Lord Cromwell. But if you have signed a pact, then they will continue to return to enforce their pact, until they claim your soul, or until we defeat them utterly, and destroy the pact.&quot; Durathror sucked on his moustache for a moment, looking grim and thoughtful.
&quot;What are these name of God?&quot; Charles asked.
&quot;Oh they are in the bible&quot; Cromwell replied. &quot;'Almighty Living God', 'The Lord of Hosts', 'God Most High' and several others. The English words did not work, but then prince Durathror repeated the original Hebrew words, and the Demons cringed. I repeated what Prince Durathror taught me: Yahweh Asher Yihweh, Adonai, El Hai Shadai... but I now forget the rest.&quot;
&quot;If you can remember those, they will serve you well when next they attack.&quot;
&quot;But why is it that the name of Jesus was ineffective?&quot; Cromwell asked. &quot;Is it not written that at his name every knee shall bow? And in his name may his followers banish demons?&quot;
Durathror wagged his eyebrows, shrugged. I commented &quot;Perhaps that is the point - that power is for his true followers. Was there not the story on Acts of the Jewish brothers who were magi? They had some small magical powers, but when they tried to use the name of Jesus to cast out demons, the demons laughed and smote them?&quot;
Cromwell and several other puritans nodded. Durathror took up my point &quot;Lord Cromwell, I do not wish to belabor the point, but over the past few years there is precious little you and your followers have done of which Jesus would approve. As it is said, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but it is still the road to hell. Unfortunately, this is the road you and your followers have walked.&quot;
There were stricken looks on several faces. Cromwell pursed his lips; I noticed his lower lip was trembling. He breathed deeply before he spoke. &quot;Have we not turned aside from that road?&quot; His voice sounded thick.
&quot;You have, but turning aside is not enough. It is a long hard road out of hell; if you would live, then you must walk that road.&quot;
&quot;Then walk it we shall!&quot; He seemed to be regaining his determination, though his lower lip still trembled.
&quot;It is a hard road, the devil will send forth his cohorts to drag you from it.&quot;
&quot;Think you they will?&quot;
Amrik nodded. &quot;Tis like any army under a general. You fought a battle, but you have not won the war. They will regroup and return stronger, and each time they are beaten, they will bring more force until they are utterly defeated, or they win.&quot;
&quot;What if they have signed a pact?&quot; Charles persued.
&quot;Then your majesty, even God will not defend them should Lucifer seek to enforce the pact.&quot; Durathror wagged his finger in the air. &quot;If there is a pact, then we must seek it out and destroy it, or prove it null and void.&quot;
&quot;But surely if we signed anything, we signed unknowingly, or under duress?&quot; Cromwell protested. &quot;That must render it null and void.&quot;
&quot;Cromwell&quot; Imladril asked &quot;If we brought someone before you who had signed a pact with the devil, would you be that lenient? Or would you condemn the man for the pact, regardless of the circumstances of the signing?&quot;
Cromwell frowned. &quot;Hmm, I take your point your majesty. We would need much evidence to convince us that such a man did not willingly sign away his soul.&quot;
&quot;And as you judge, so will God judge you.&quot; Durathror observed. &quot;The fact that you cannot now remember signing would be a starting point, but we would need to accumulate evidence. Throwing yourselves on God's mercy may not be sufficient. By signing such a pact you have proved that you are spiritually worse than almost any condemned criminal.&quot;
I had an inkling now of where Durathror was leading. He needed to engender a complete change of heart in the puritans. These straight laced holy hypocrits would be severly compromised to realize they had behaved worse than almost everyone they had condemned at their witch trials.
&quot;You thought you were holy, incorruptible, God's own voice on earth.&quot; I raised my voice. &quot;You should know that if you set yourselves up as examples to others, then God will use you as an example, and allow Satan to test you, as he tested Job.&quot; I paused for dramatic effect. &quot;Job passed his test, you puritans have failed. Now you are reaping the consequences.&quot;
Cromwell looked downcast, both angry and sad at the same time. &quot;We lacked compassion for those less righteous than ourselves. Our lack of compassion has now come back to haunt us.&quot;
&quot;As has your persuit of righteousness. You know now that righteousness is not the path of salvation, it is the path of the old convenant.&quot; I drove home a point while Durathror nodded. &quot;If you would be Christians, you must abandon the first covenant and righteousness, and adopt the second covenant. Follow the teachings of Jesus, and show compassion on your fellow man. Otherwise, you have signed your own decree of damnation through your righteousness.&quot;
There was a tear in Cromwell's eye now. &quot;We became like the pharisees.&quot; he said slowly, his voice quavery. &quot;Satan used our righteousness to trick us. How ... how do we make amends?&quot; He bit his lower lip to stop it quivering, and probably prevented a sob from escaping.
Durathror responded &quot;You must repudiate your pact, and your persuit of righteousness. You have made a start by cancelling the witch trials, and the persecutions, but you must make complete restitution of everything to everyone who has been wronged. You cannot bring the dead back to life, but you can pay blood money to their families. You must prove to God that you are worthy of salvation. That is the only way you could convince God to set aside any pact you have signed with Lucifer.&quot;
It seemed to me that there were forty puritans hanging their heads in shame. Most looked embarrassed, the rest looked stricken and a little tearful. Cromwell sighed deeply, lifted his head and raised his voice. &quot;It shall be done! My brethren, are you in agreement?&quot;
There was an uncertain chorus of 'aye' from the puritans. Cromwell turned to look at each of them. &quot;I said we would make complete restitution of all our wrong doings. All of us were deceived by Satan, and we behaved like the pharisees. Do you all agree that we will do all that is humanly possible to rectify this? Then may we through ourselves on God's mercy, and ask His forgiveness for our greivous sins. Are you in agreement?&quot;
The chorus was stronger. Matthew added &quot;'Tis the mark of a true Christian, should he find himself fallen into sin or error, that he freely admit his failing, and do all he can to atone for his misdeeds. Any who do not agree are not Christian!&quot; The others chorused their support.
Cromwell added &quot;It seems that all of us may have inadvertently signed demonic pacts while we dreamed. Do you all repudiate any such pacts?&quot;
This time the chorus was loud. Atoning for misdeeds might be one thing, requiring as yet unknown actions, but repudiating demonic pacts seemed easy and straightforward.
&quot;Then it is agreed. We shall...&quot; his voice faded.
The room swam with rainbow light, the floor seemed to tilt, and things spun. At first I thought this might be another orchestration by Durathror, except that he called out &quot;All of you, gather around me!&quot; He leapt onto the table, a golden nimbus surrounding him. The other Viharani were similarly limned.
My own shadow shifting senses told me we were no longer in the banquet hall in Hampton Court, but somewhere else, somewhere so distant through shadow that I could not even get a fix on Hampton Court. We were still seated at our tables, with the remnants of our meal there. We seemed o be in a huge dark cavern, lit by flickers of flame that floated in the air. The walls rippled and flowed as if their shape could not be fixed. The candelabra on our table began to flow like hot wax, melting into a flowing puddle on the table cloth.
The chair in which I was seated rocked, and its arms moved to wrap themselves around me. I struggled briefly before a thought popped into my mind &lt;&lt;Use Sorcery!&gt;&gt; The question was how. Unless you have learned a series of attacks and spells to counter them, you have to improvise. Most spells that Nalini and I have learned are associated with mandala or designs. We focus our attention on the appropriate mandala to activate the spell.
Something wet and slobbery began breathing behind my neck, and I reacted almost without thinking. The glyph that came to mind activates a fairly dangerous spell, one that turns things into sand. You don't want to use it near your friends unless you know exactly what you are doing.
My dreaming senses knew that the chair had morphed into something that was attacking me, and that became the focus of my spell. There was a brief vortex of power, the chair gave way, and I collapsed onto the floor. I sprang to my feet. Nearby Amrik was cursing, and hacking his chair into a sodden gooey green mess. Others were locked in their own struggles. Nalini was sprawled on her back on a second pile of sand; she sprang to her feet as I moved to help her.
Imladril, Iskandor and Durathror stood together on a table, formed into a circle holding hands. Their table was still a table from the dining hall at Hampton Court, and the area around them seemed to be normal. That area extended outward for perhaps five or six meters, outside that things oozed and dripped. Enyil and Ra'anor were moving amongst those trapped by their chairs, freeing them. Nalini hugged me briefly, then we moved to help king Charles. He had a dagger in his hand and was stabbing with it over his shoulder. The high back of his chair had grown a long face with a beak like a bird of prey, except that he king's dagger had found the beak, and drawn green blood. Nalini and I touched the chair briefly while activating the spell. The chair flickered, and crumbled into a pile of sand. We helped the king to his feet, and into the safe area.
The piles of sand did not stay like that for long. One transformed into congealing blood that flowed to the safe zone, and lapped about its perimeter. Another became a horde of small stinging insects that ran about. A third oozed wetly into a grotesque parody of a human, lumpen and misshapen, a single eye in its chest, three long multi-jointed arms ending in claws, and an elongated ribbed head that reminded me a little of the creature in the Alien films. It hissed and spat at us, but could not cross the boundary. The rest of us huddled inside the boundary.
Some of the floor turned into water, then a tall iceberg reared up. Its tip burst into blue flame that became butterflies at its ragged edges. The ice cracked into shards of glass that splintered everywhere. The slivers transformed into bright little eyes with legs that ran around and stared at us.
A nearby table deformed into a small elephant like creature with a spiny tail, the cloth twisted and became a reptilian rider. Nothing would stay in one form. The elephant became four trees, while the reptile became bird that took flight with leathery wings. The trees became four armed orcs that screamed some battle cry and attacked. Fortunately they too were stopped at the edge of our safe zone.
Things oozed and dripped, things slithered and crawled, things flapped and hopped. Colored flames flared in different parts of the cavern. A swarm of glowing coals sank like a shower of meteroites. A wind howled into our cavern, and a spectral face appeared. It was really only sketched in, holes for eyes, holes here and there to suggest bone structure. It hovered a few meters distant and was probably easily as tall as a man. The face was so badly sketched that it might have been semi human, or it might have been bestial, we could not tell.
Even the substance of shadow seemed tissue thin here. A thousand thousand shadows swarmed close enough to touch, all of them filled with menace. Something horned and cloven hoofed chased its prey through woodland. The hunter caught it, and ripped its still living prey apart with its fangs. Then it seemed to notice us, moved its bloodied claws as if parting a curtain, and walked into our shadow. Behind it tattered shreds of our shadow swayed in a breeze, beyond which we could see the woodlands.
In another shadow, hooded monks walked a dark cloister. Their leader drew a crooked dagger from his sleeve, and used it to slash twice in the air before him, forming a cross in a parody of a christian benediction. The shadows parted, and they strode into our shadow. The substance of shadow flapped like a torn curtain. The monks drew up before us. In each hood three glowing eyes swam, but there seemed to be nothing else in the hood.
&quot;Where are we?&quot; Prospero asked for all of us. He and I were pushing a writhing table into the safe zone, where it solidified into something that looked like a bunch of half melted candles. Imladril placed her hands upon it and concentrated; it transformed into the solid wooden table it had once been. Ra'anor gestured to a group of cowering puritans to clamber onto the table.
&quot;Somewhere I would rather not be.&quot; Durathror stated grimly.
&quot;Is this hell?&quot; Cromwell asked.
&quot;Not quite, but a close approximation.&quot; Durathror responded. &quot;This could well be somewhere near the Courts of Chaos. Should we escape from here, we would be weeks returning home, and every step would be fraught with danger. We have angered someone powerful.&quot;
&quot;I've heard mention of the Courts of Chaos.&quot; Amrik began. &quot;What are they?&quot; He shoved a third table into our little safe zone, where Imladril transformed it. She helped him settle it against the other two.
&quot;Our entire set of shadows is cast by the archetype of order and chaos.&quot; Imladril responded. &quot;Think of a fishing net strung between two poles. Each opening in the net is like a shadow, a world we can visit. The two poles are the Courts of Order and the Courts of Chaos. They are the realms of god like beings. Order is fixed, stagnant, crystaline. Chaos is fluid, changable, like you see here.&quot;
The further wall fizzled and sputtered, and another shadow barged in. This one was much more like a conventional picture of hell: there were fires, and demonic figures roasting living beings over them. Their living fless was rotting, and worms and maggots swarmed through them.
&quot;Cromwell, these realms are responding to your thoughts!&quot; Imladril admonished. Amrik and I dragged a forth table kicking and screaming into the safe zone. That seemed to be about all we could fit.
&quot;How do we get out of here?&quot;
&quot;It took great power to bring us here, it will take similar power to escape. All the shadows we frequent are like a few squares in the middle of the net. Here is completely to one side.&quot;
&quot;Are we safe here?&quot; someone asked.
There were perhaps thirty people crowded onto the tops of four large tables, which did not leave a lot of room.
&quot;No, but we are not in any immediate danger. We will need help to escape though.&quot; Imladril responded. &quot;Danny and Nalini, we might need what ever assistance your gems can provide.&quot;
For Imladril to admit that meant she didn't think we had much chance of escaping. We needed somewhere to sit so we could attune ourselves to the gems, but there wasn't much space.
Iskandor was crawling on his hands and knees between everyone's feet. He touched my feet to gain my attention, then said telepathically &lt;&lt;Ready your gems, but do not activate them. Durathror would prefer not to attract the attention of certain beings right now.&gt;&gt;
Nalini and I wondered what he was doing; as we watched he placed his hands on the gap between two table tops, and with a flicker there was no gap, just a seamless piece of wood. He proceeded to fuse all four table tops into one platform.
Nalini and I hugged, and began the process of linking our minds. We have to take our attention off our surroundings, which isn't always safe.
&quot;Maggots from the human realms. Do not think your little bubble will save you.&quot; The voice was the howling of the wind. &quot;I will add you to my collection. Come.&quot;
The floor of the cavern curled up to form a huge hand, and next thing our tables were raised on the palm of the hand. A black tarry substance dripped down towards us, only to be stopped by some invisible force. Seeing the gobbets suspended in mid air gave me a strong impression that somehow we were inside a glass bubble.
&quot;What is it you want?&quot; Imladril asked.
Most of the other figures sloughed away into puddles of ooze that smoked and evaporated. The six monks and the horned thing remained, though their forms ran like water. One of the monks transformed into a huge hooded cobra, a second into a gorilla like creature with a horse's head and a human head, with the third its habit became dark feathers and its face a human mask with nothing behind it, the fourth sprouted many limbs and its body contracted to resemble a huge hairy spider, the fifth grew leathery wings, and a cloudy blue sky appeared inside its hood, while the sixth transformed into a beautiful naked boy with marble white skin, curly golden hair and a huge penis as thick as Amrik's forearm that dangled almost to the floor. The head of the penis was barbed, and something black and smoky dripped from the end. The horned one transformed into something resembling a minotaur with both breasts and a penis.
The pretty boy responded &quot;Want? I shall ride each of the men, and split them open.&quot;
The minotaur added &quot;And I shall ride the women, and split them with my weapon!&quot;
The pretty boy fingered his cock. &quot;Ooh, and then I shall ride them from behind, just like the men!&quot;
Gorilla head added &quot;I shall eat you alive, the choicest morsels, the eyes, the tongues, the teats, the testicles and clitorises.&quot;
Snake added &quot;I shall flay you alive and wear your skins!&quot;
Feathered shaman added &quot;But do not think you shall die, I will not permit that. Your blood shall be added to my castle of blood. See there it rises from the lake!&quot;
The images of hellfires blew away in the breeze, along with most of the cavern. We seemed to be traveling across a landscape of conical orange hills and eliptical blue depressions. From our vantage point we could see a large lake of scummy brown stuff off to our left. In the midst of the lake rose a castle like structure that was the color of fresh blood.
Nalini and I had linked minds, and were now activating each of the links to our gems. One of the links seemed close, and we followed it. With a shock we both realized that the power link lead into the castle of blood.
&quot;Did you call us here?&quot; Imladril asked.
There was a pregnant pause, during which Nalini and I began syphoning power from the castle of blood, and pushing it down the other links.
&quot;Then you have no power over us!&quot; Imladril responded. She gestured at pretty boy, and his form melted into a hideously ugly toad.
&quot;Here! You can't do that!&quot; one of the figures cried.
Nalini and I shunted power from all the other sources back into the castle of blood, and set our attention to disrupting what ever held it together. There was a dull thump and the castle began collapsing into a sticky puddle. All seven figures taunting us likewise melted into congealing puddles on the monstrous hand.
Durathror gave a groan, and then our table lurched into another shadow. Someone gave a cheer, but Imladril warned &quot;They were just the underlings. The real power will step in now.&quot;
We floated over a vast lake that might have been boiling mud or molten lava. Furnace like heat washed over us and the roiling surface burped foul smelling gasses at us.
We shifted again, and a plane of white sand humped and shifted, forming sand castles of its own accord. Stars pulsated with colored light like Christmas lights. We hovered for perhaps five seconds before shifting again.
Striated sky as far as the eye could see, and scudding multicolored clouds beneath us. The wind was freezing, the air thin. We shifted again.
Imladril caught Nalini and I, and pushed us into the circle she formed with Durathror and Iskandor. She began linking her mind with ours. It was an odd sensation, Nalini and I were almost one mind and one thought, and there was this other that was Imladril. Durathror's and Iskandor's minds floated in behind hers, but they seemed preoccupied. Between them they were levitating our platform and shifting us through shadow as fast as they could. The two men had little attention or power to spare.
Imladril was coordinating local defenses. Her thoughts floated into our awareness. &lt;&lt;We need to tap into the power links of those gems. There might be sufficient power to save us.&gt;&gt; Unspoken behind it was a quiet sense of desperation. Without some form of help we were outgunned and it was only a matter of time before we succumbed.
The gems were a brilliant presence in this sorcerous mind meld. On one level there were sixteen links to distant places of power, radiating out like spokes from a wheel to infinity. All sixteen links were active, and linked to Nalini and me. Within us there was the core that had saved us when the orange creatures had tried to destroy us. That core was shut tight like an oyster, giving little hint as to its nature. Except that the links merged with this core, and from there the power was somehow available to the two of us. The power could be put to use, and one use would be to cause the core to open.
&lt;&lt;Not that!&gt;&gt; Imladril cautioned, aware of our thoughts. &lt;&lt;We do not know what it is, but it banished the serpent, it could destroy all of us in the backlash.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;The power is there, sixteen links only. One links back to beneath the castle of blood.&gt;&gt; Neither Nalini nor I replied, but rather both of us together.
&lt;&lt;So that was how you destroyed it and those creatures. That explains why the god has been tardy to act. It wanted to scope out our powers, and that display both freed us and warned it. Permit me to touch the links.&gt;&gt;
Without our permission, she would be case aside at best, and possibly injured or killed at worst. &lt;&lt;Go ahead.&gt;&gt; We sat back to watch what happened.
Nalini and I were aware of our separate identities, but also aware of our completeness when together. Nalini is no other, no mere partner, she and I are one, two parts of a greater whole. We were aware of Imladril, Iskandor and Durathror as others, but the two of us were concerned with reconciling ourselves with that deep core that linked us. It was almost as if that core were our third half.
Somewhere in that locked core was a dark secret that explained what we are, and who we had been. The two of us have been reincarnating together over hundreds or even thousands of lives, often dying for each other. Our many lives have not been kind to us. Buried down there is the pain and utter devastation of so many deaths, the memories of other worse pains. What ever else there is, the core harbors something vast and cold and arrogant, almost completely indifferent to anything other than the two of us. The coldness and arrogance began to surface, in defiance of Imladril's order.
Or to use another analogy, the core began to open just a crack, enabling us to reach into the core in search of what we had once been. Whether that search is such a good idea we cannot say, but we have a strong desire to find out. Both of us are pulled to discover what we have been, to remember the long sequence of our lives, and somehow heal that deep, dark pain. In its pain the cold vastness was indifferent to everyone on our platform, but would take drastic action if either Nalini or I were threatened at that deep level.
Imladril tapped into several links, and the power flowed out into Durathror and Iskandor. The distance of each shift increased remarkably, and we marveled at the abilities of the Viharani. We were also aware of whatever they were aware of; including a flock of dark flying things that followed us through shadow, and was gaining on us.
&lt;&lt;The god has shot his bolt when he dragged us into his realm.&gt;&gt; Imladril explained. &lt;&lt;He stepped directly into the shadows in full manifestation. He acted outside the rules, and has alerted both the eagle and the serpent. He dare not act again like that, he faces banishment such as you inflicted on the serpent. Those dark things following us are as much as he may manifest in the shadows, and he knows now that we have power to destroy his creatures.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Can we defeat him?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;With your gems we have a chance. Without them we lacked the power to break free from his realm. Do not mess with the core! It will save you, but could destroy the rest of us.&gt;&gt;
We had already reached that conclusion. Nalini and I, the new persona overlay, cared for our friends. The core did not. The two of us snuggled together, and waited in readiness for the action to commence.
We fled for between twenty and thirty minutes, shifting every few seconds. This by itself was a testament to the power and skills of Durathror and Iskandor. Imladril commented &lt;&lt;They hope we will tire soon, then they will attack. If they leave it too long, we will tire.&gt;&gt;
The attack happened quite suddenly. We had just shifted into a shadow with tall mountains spreading out around us, and I do mean spreading. They flowed outwards something like waves, more mountains forming behind them. Pale red snow fell from a sky that resembled an ocean of blood. Seven misshapen black things materialized around us, and vomited gouts of black goo onto us. The black stuff hit our bubble, and spread over it, obscuring our view. Somehow it managed to block our shadow shifting senses as well, making it difficult to detect shadows.
Imladril played with some power links and the black stuff flared into bright green flame, eye searingly bright. The goo vanished. Three of the black creatures careened into our bubble, spreading themselves over its surface. They had a similar effect to the black goo. Imladril tried again, but though the creatures burned, they did not vanish. Three more splattered against our bubble, and now we began to drift toward the ground.
The one remaining creature tried to rake us with a lightning bolt, but Nalini and I reacted almost without thought. We selected a link within the gems and the bolt's energy was sucked away harmlessly, to be stored back at whatever were the sources for these links. The god tried again, summoning power through his own power objects. Imladril thought &lt;&lt;Now comes the killing blow!&gt;&gt;
Imladril directed more power to what ever kept out bubble formed, but it seemed that the six creatures between them were sucking power from our bubble faster than it could be replaced. There is a limit to how much energy a human can channel before it burns out the channel. I had this incongruous flashback to an old Star Trek picture, with Scottie saying &quot;Capt'n, the shields canna hold much longer! We're running oot of power!&quot;
&lt;&lt;This isn't funny, we are running out of power.&gt;&gt; Imladril stated.
The bolt came with a tremendous concussion, but something terrible at the other end of the link we had activated sucked away most of the power, leaving the god nonplussed.
&lt;&lt;That blow should have been unstoppable.&gt;&gt; Imladril sounded relieved, as if hope was returning. &lt;&lt;He knows now he lacks the power to destroy us outright, and must slowly drain us instead. We cannot shift through shadow while those creatures obscure our sense of shadows. We must somehow destroy the master before those creatures break through our defenses.&gt;&gt;
Can gods be created and destroyed? There are tales, but none of us knows for sure. The body a god uses to manifest can be killed, but the god can simply manifest again. Experienced gods do not need to go through the whole birth and childhood thing, they simply assert themselves and manifest. A more effective process is to destroy the god's heart, effectively banishing him until he can create another, a process that can take hundreds or thousands of years. To destroy a god's heart would normally release enough power to devastate surrounding shadows more effectively than gigaton nuclear weapons. Even to kill a god is a task that requires much power. Nalini and I briefly entertained a thought of sailing into a vacuum to see if that would affect the creatures, or perhaps into some gravity well near a black hole and tearing them apart.
Durathror's thoughts suddenly swam into focus. &lt;&lt;Steady on you two! We would all be destroyed before the creatures would be. They are torn from the primal chaos, only a lord or order or chaos can destroy them.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;And their master IS a lord of chaos.&gt;&gt; we responded sardonically. &lt;&lt;What hope have we got?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;While we live we have hope!&gt;&gt; Durathror sounded confident. &lt;&lt;True, he is a god, but while he cannot be destroyed, he can be banished.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Doesn't that need our dagger, and the Eagle?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Perhaps, perhaps not. First, can we open the links one by one to the maximum possible? Start with that one.&gt;&gt;
In some odd way, several of the links were being channeled directly to Durathror. He showed us how to open the active link carefully. Since he was the conduit, he did not wish to ramp the power up beyond what he could handle. Already our platform was being buffeted from side to side by monstrous winds, and rocked by thunderous concussions.
As the link was opened the buffeting wind suddenly died. &lt;&lt;Ha! I'll bet that hurt him! Now open that one.&gt;&gt;
We opened a second and then a third link, stopping when Durathror began groaning in pain. Most of the power was being channeled through him, not us, but the back wash felt like electrified ants crawling and biting inside our bodies.
Beyond normal sight a right royal battle was being waged. Invisible forces struggled with one another, seeking to hold or overcome the opposing forces. To our sorcerous sight everything around was thunder and lightning, a tumult that threatened to leave us deafened, blinded and with all our nerves burned out. Swirling vortexes of power threatened to engulf us.
Nalini and I are not in Durathror's league, but even to us it was obvious that the god opposing us was more powerful. We hoped we had strength in numbers. Durathror had two links fully open, and a third partially opened. Imladril, Iskandor and then Enyil linked and channeled power from the gems, but only Imladril could handle a single link at full power, the other two shared one link and did not open that fully. We had opened other links, but only to a level that we could tolerate, which was much less than the Viharani. The pain that their channeling caused grew to be quite intense, as if we were being roasted over hot coals and electrocuted at the same time.
Normal eyes and ears detected nothing other than the buffeting that was a byproduct of our struggle, and the convulsive backlash the sorcerer channeling the power experienced.
By now our platform was being slammed around the sky as if we were a ball being hit by a giant baseball bat. Many of us were sprawled on top of each other, and it was all Ra'anor could do to use her own sorcery to prevent us from being badly injured.
Nalini and I shared a thought: we had to employ our dagger. Part of the problem was avoiding stabbing those around us. Neither of us could stand, but then as we were thrown on top of several puritans our joined hands touched the solid seeming wall of the bubble. There was a slight lull before the next buffet, we willed the dagger into our hands, and thrust it through the bubble.
There was an electric shock as it passed through our bubble, then the blade penetrated the chaos creature on the outside. Numbing cold swam up our arms, freezing them solid, but somehow one of the power links surged, and a countering warmth shot back. For several long moments it was as if we gripped a live high voltage line, the agony was intense, but we could not let go. The chaos creature stabbed by our blade screamed an ululating cry of agony.
Something deep inside us said 'enough!'. I felt us change, Nalini into the woman with the Jaguar head, and myself into the man with the Eagle head. The change was heralded by a sense of bilocation, as if we were in two places at once, and then with a feeling of watery energy we shape shifted. The agony of the power flows faded. Then two power links opened fully, on in the gem in Nalini's ring, one in the gem in the hilt of my dagger. A tremendous jolt of energy seared the dagger blade and ran around the outside surface of the bubble. The pain was so intense we screamed, but by now we were no longer in control.
What ever was in that energy burned into the chaos creatures, turning them all to black tarry gobbets that ran over the bubble and dropped off. Outside we saw a huge man with purple skin, almond yellow eyes and writhing snakes for hair. His face was contorted into a fierce grin.
Durathror seized the moment and shifted us arrow like through a vortex of shadows that spun around us like a maelstrom. Nalini and I could sense his thoughts: he had no clear destination in mind other than getting away from this realm. It seemed an incredibly dangerous thing to do, there was no way he could know through which shadows we would pass, but we had to assume that somehow he was in control.
The vortex was accompanied by a screaming cacophony of noises, from a shrieking hurricane to battle cries, from the crash of surf to baby cries, from laughter to tears, while a myriad different scenes superimposed themselves, and faded into one another, twisting and spiraling madly.
Suddenly a blizzard of purplish snow struck, obscuring everything except for a small green steam engine traveling upside down that passed us. Those of us with shadow shifting senses knew we had almost stopped moving. The front of our platform struck soft sand and almost everyone pitched forward in a heap. The purple snow vanished to reveal the details of our surroundings. Durathror, Imladril and Iskandor were hovering in mid air, Nalini and I were standing with our feet on the table top, at an absurd angle, seemingly oblivious to the forces of gravity.
At first site we had landed on the sandy beach of a tropical isle, but the resemblance ended after the first glance. Gravity appeared to be a local phenomena, fluctuating wildly over the matter of a few feet, and seemed to be perpendicular to the direction of surface, regardless of the angle of the surface. On our table top down was through the bottom of the table, at an odd angle to the ground. On the ground down varied with the slope of the ground, so Rupert could stand on the side of a mound at right angles to its surface. The ground itself did not stay fixed for more than five minutes at a time, it changed shape and levels as if it were a living thing, currently sleeping and twitching.
The sea varied between a calm millpond and raging surf smashing onto the shore, while its color rippled through the rainbow. One moment it was the color of yellow soft drink, with blood red foam, the next moment it was green sea with pale blue foam.
Trees sprang up, grew to maturity and died in a matter of hours. Even the grains of sand would grow little legs, walk around a bit, then settle down again to being grains of sand. Odd shapes drifted through the sky: rocks, city skyscrapers, a street full of cars and so on in some weird parody of clouds. Everything was chaotic, but an ordered sort of chaos.
We tried to find neighboring shadows, but there were none near by. Nothing was close enough to reach without prodigious effort, and even those were chaotic, twisting.
&lt;&lt;He has isolated us.&gt;&gt; Durathror remarked to those of us that were linked.
&quot;Where are we?&quot;
&quot;Near the edge of his realm, our environment is more regular here.&quot;
&quot;Is anyone hurt?&quot; Imladril called out.
&quot;Badly shaken perhaps.&quot; Cromwell remarked, dusting himself off. &quot;Have we escaped?&quot;
&quot;I think the fun is about to start.&quot; Amrik quipped, helping Charles to his feet. Then he drew his black broadsword, and walked over to us.
&quot;Friend Amrik, that will be of no avail against our foe.&quot;
&quot;What is he, Durathror?&quot;
&quot;Call him a god, but a new one, not the old ones. He has less power, but still he can shape shadow, and uncreate. I am not yet sure which one he is, but he has brought us to his realm, and blocked our escape. I can tell you that he is the one behind the puritans' schemes.&quot;
&quot;So you really did traffic with demons.&quot; Charles stated sourly to Cromwell and Matthew.
The two puritans looked at one another, an unfathomable expression on their faces, then Cromwell asked &quot;Why call him a god? Is he not a demon?&quot;
&quot;Think of him not as one of your Christian demons, but rather as one of the Greek or Roman gods. He is not rebellious, but a ruler in his own realm.:
&quot;Is there anything we can do? Would prayer help?&quot;
&quot;Provided you pray to the right god&quot; Durathror spat back &quot;it will do no harm.&quot; Cromwell made a face.
A purple skinned giant appeared out in the ocean, wading rapidly towards us. There were snakes for his hair, he had six arms, each one carrying a weapon, and he wore a necklace of human skulls and a short kilt of white fabric.
&quot;What happens now?&quot; Charles asked.
&quot;I would say we fight.&quot; Prospero sighed, drawing his saber. &quot;There is no where to run, and nowhere to hide.&quot;
Durathror held up his hand. &quot;It ends here. Either he destroys all of us, or maybe we can defeat him. If any of you feel you need to prepare yourselves for death, now would be a good time.&quot;
&quot;By Mithras, Durathror, you are a bag of gloom!&quot; Amrik complained. &quot;Did we not defeat the Serpent itself? We will defeat this one too!&quot;
Durathror suddenly laughed. &quot;Friend Amrik, it will be a glorious fight! We have held his sorcery at bay, perhaps it will come down to skill with weapons. We will be outclassed, but there are more of us, perhaps we can defeat him.&quot; His thought continued &lt;&lt;Most of us will die trying, and even if we win, we will be trapped in this isolated shadow.&gt;&gt; He laughed again. &quot;Prepare to fight!&quot;
&quot;Die in battle and we will have an honor guard to the afterlife!&quot; Amrik responded.
&quot;Now who's being gloomy?&quot; Durathror shot back.
It occurred to Nalini and I that this god probably had hundreds of thousands of years practice with weapons, and even if he was vulnerable, he would dance rings around all of us. &quot;Is he vulnerable anywhere?&quot;
&quot;He is immortal. But if you sever his head and keep the head separate his manifestation will perish, and if you can destroy his heart he will be banished for thousands of years. I would prefer to try talking our way out if we can.&quot;
The being stomped onto the shore, shrinking down to more human height, and made straight for us. He looked vaguely human, but his purple skin seen close up looked to be like a reptile's, only the scales were like amethysts. His mouth worked into something between a snarl and a smile. &quot;You have lead me a merry dance! I'll give you that.&quot; His voice boomed over the crash of the waves, his teeth glittered like diamonds.
&quot;What is it you want?&quot; Durathror asked.
The creature laughed &quot;I want many things, but what I desire from you is sport, and your eventual deaths.&quot;
&quot;Why did you capture us? What are we to you?&quot;
The god cocked his head. &quot;Why, you interfered with my plans. For that you must die! But now I know you are powerful sorcerers, I will enjoy the game. Entertain me, and you shall die swiftly as a reward.&quot;
Amrik moved away from the rest of us, circling around the god. Prospero moved in the opposite direction. Nalini and I drew our swords and followed Amrik. There didn't seem to be much else left for us to do. My dagger was in my left hand. Imladril asked &quot;Who are you? We know you are a chaos lord, but that is all.&quot;
&quot;You do not know me?&quot; The god drew himself up, bowed toward Imladril. &quot;Pretty Lady, perhaps I shall save you till last. Give you a chance to be of service before I dispatch you. I am Brass, duke of chaos, and knight of swords.&quot;
Close up, he was about three meters tall, with the stocky muscleclature of a gorilla, enough to make Amrik look weedy by comparison. Brass stooped a little to peer at us. &quot;Black birds of ill omen, sorcerers, swordsmen and six women, sorcerers or swordswomen all.&quot;
&quot;I don't suppose there is any way we could convince you to let us go?&quot; Durathror asked.
Brass's face turned sly and cunning. &quot;I doubt it. What could you possible offer me that I cannot take from you right now?&quot;
&quot;Friendship?&quot;
&quot;I need no friendship with maggots from the human realms.&quot; Brass laughed.
Durathror shrugged. &quot;Well, it was worth a try.&quot;
Brass smiled, an expression full of rat cunning. &quot;Perhaps if you were to leave all the women with me, I could let the rest of you go. They could keep me amused in other ways for a time.&quot;
Amrik muttered some curse under his breath. Durathror responded &quot;They would die slowly and horribly while we watched, and then you would come for us. We gain nothing.&quot;
&quot;Oh, you would gain a few days of life. Isn't that what you mortals hold most dear?&quot;
&quot;There are worse fates than death!&quot; Amrik spat back. &quot;Either fight, or piss off! You wouldn't be the first god we've killed!&quot;
&quot;Ah, edged weapons. How delightfully primitive! I might see just how long you can beg for mercy.&quot;
Brass blurred into motion, attacking Amrik, and as he did the remnants of our tables flew at him. Two of his swords struck Amrik and sent him reeling, the table tops burst into flame, and Brass spun, slicing a hand from Prospero. His saber with his hand still gripping the hilt arced in the sunlight. Brass charged into the thick of us, scattering the Viharani and cutting a swathe through the puritans. Blood spurted and limbs flew. Gunshots rang out from Liz and Paula, but the bullets ricocheted from Brass' tough hide.
The sand suddenly sprang into the air and blanketed Brass. A second later the sand became water, and a grinning god reappeared, swinging six swords in a glittering net. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Prospero wrapping his belt about his forearm in an attempt to stop the bleeding. Amrik, Durathror and Iskandor all confronted Brass. Amrik was covered in blood. Nalini and I closed from the other direction.
Swords flashed, and Amrik's hand went flying. Durathror and Iskandor had some kind of shielding spell, and suffered no injury, though they went flying. Nalini and I had our own shield spells activated, powered by what ever force we could wring from our gems. Brass moved far too quickly for either of us, trying to cut our own hands off. His blades struck our shields and he howled. Obviously whatever shielding spell we'd managed was more powerful than he expected.
He stepped back a pace, swung two swords idly behind him, slashing two puritans to ribbons in the process. Then he tossed his swords into the air, and caught them again. This time he held a black bladed sword in one hand. The blade seemed to drink the light, and silver runes writhed along its length. The hair on the back of my neck prickled, and we both felt a strong sense of deja vu.
&lt;&lt;That's a chaos blade! Beware!&gt;&gt; Durathror cautioned. He seemed to think that it would cut through our shields like a hot knife through butter.
Brass paused long enough to look around, then sprang to the attack. Power arced around him while he swung his swords Nalini and I seemed immune to the power, but not the Viharani who scattered with yells of pain. However, there was no way I could move fast enough to parry: his black blade sizzled as it sliced through my shield spell, slid underneath my sword arm and bit deep into my right hand side. It wasn't so much the pain as the shock, but the sword stuck in my ribs, siphoning energy from me. I thought it chuckled obscenely as it drank. We both knew with sudden clarity that this was how the final death happened, that a chaos blade could drain the power from our very souls, and destroy them.
In that bitter kiss we both knew this had happened before. The when and the what were locked inside our core. Nalini, linked to me, shared the thoughts and memories that floated up. A chaos blade had torn her from me once, back in the past so dim and distant that it was memories of memories of memories many times removed. But the ache, the black despair that welled up with that thought! Then I had thought I faced eternity without her, and had sought out the chaos blade myself rather than face that. To follow was an act of love, to be taken first was... bitter desolation. What ever had happened that time, something of us survived. We couldn't be here with these memories unless we had survived. What, or how we survived, neither of us know.
&quot;I have braved the fires of hell for you!&quot; that thought floated free from the depths, blazing forth with an intensity that shook us to our core. It had taken eons to find one another again. Desolate eons. But no power in the universe could keep us separate. In that lay the source of our own power.
All these memories happened in a few split seconds.
Inside us something flared, bright like a supernova, and hard like a diamond. The core within us opened, that vast, cold nameless entity struggled up from the depths within us, pushing us to one side and taking control. My own sword was falling from nerveless fingers. Nalini had one arm about me, supporting me. We both knew I was about to die, my soul destroyed. The jeweled dagger was suddenly in her other hand. Everything seemed to kick into slow motion.
Nalini screams, high and ragged &quot;Never again!&quot;
Brass starting in surprise, shaking his chaos blade to free it from my flesh. Another of his blades tries to slash off Nalini's hand, but the dagger draws the sword to it, and as they strike the sword shatters like glass.
&quot;No!&quot; Brass springing backwards, slicing with his chaos blade as he tried to draw it free. Surely I cannot live more than a few moments, I cannot feel my body any more, I am a disembodied spirit watching. Brass's face registers shock and surprise, as if he realizes what is happening.
&quot;NEVER AGAIN!!!!!&quot; Nalini's voice, but now so loud the ground shakes. She swings the dagger at Brass. The Chaos blade meets the Eagle's dagger and screams like a woman. Brass gags with pain, mouth open like a beached fish.
Brass, releasing his chaos blade in desperation, and springing backwards in a prodigious leap, but all in slow motion. Nalini, jaguar swift, striking forward, the dagger seeming to leap into Brass' chest like a bullet.
&quot;NO! NO! No! No! no! no!&quot; Brass' chest falls open where the dagger pierced it, leaving something yellow and heart shaped visible that pulses with light. My own left hand springs forward of its own accord and grasps his heart, my claws tearing it from his chest. Well being surges through me. My right swings up to grasp the hilt of the chaos blade, and I draw it from my body. I will myself whole and well.
&quot;Give it back to me!&quot; Brass is on his knees, no longer able to stand, his body melting like wax too close to a fire.
&quot;Would you prefer the chaos blade?&quot; The tip of his chaos blade pricked his throat. &quot;You would die the final death.&quot; Nalini and I spoke as one.
&quot;All your friends would die&quot; he gasped. &quot;Have mercy!&quot;
&quot;You would show no mercy, you would use your chaos blade to make us die the final death!&quot; we began, but Imladril's thoughts intruded.
&lt;&lt;We are wasting time! The others are dying!&gt;&gt;
&quot;Know that the final death is not final. We survived once before.&quot; The toe of my right foot pushed him away from the blade. Hope gleamed in his eyes.
&lt;&lt;We must use the heart to heal the others now!&gt;&gt;
Imladril could perform sorcery to heal quite severe injuries, but it required time, and most would die while she healed a few. With the god's heart we could will the others whole. Nalini and I held the heart in our left hands, and slowly surveyed the scene, willing everyone to be healed and whole. Amrik sat in a sodden bloody heap, his bowels held in his one remaining hand, a look of agony on his face. Prospero sat nearby, his face white, bright blood oozing from the stump of his right hand; Paula moving to comfort him, a look of shock on her face. Liz in tears, blood everywhere, Rupert's headless body cradled in her arms, still spurting. Charles hunched over, blood and entrails spilling between his hands, Cromwell supporting him with one arm, the other lopped at the elbow and spurting blood where it. Durathror crouching on the ground, both eyes burned from his head. Several puritans in bits scattered over the bloody sand.
Whole and healed, the mess cleaned up, everyone except Brass back in one piece. Reality rippled, and it was so. Such is the power of a god's heart.
Shock draining away from others' faces, and disbelief replacing it. Had it all been just a nasty dream? Durathror sprang to his feet, snatched the chaos blade from my fingers. Brass was now a spreading puddle, with just part of his torso and head still more or less as it was. Durathror pressed the point of the chaos blade into Brass' neck.
&quot;One more thing, lord Brass. Pray tell us how we get home.&quot;
Brass glared and growled.
&quot;I'll use the blade on you. I know how to use it. Choose. The final death, or tell us how to go home, and your manifestation dies. You'll be back before you know it!&quot;
His eyes had melted and run down his cheeks, his jaw and mouth were deformed. He managed to grate &quot;Use the heart. Ask them.&quot; His head turned toward Nalini and myself, still in our other forms. &quot;Had I known who you were....&quot; His jaw melted and dripped onto his chest. By a last act of will, he continued &lt;&lt;I would never have meddled. Are you really whom you seem? You survived the final death, is that true?&gt;&gt;.
&quot;We are, though we still have trouble with our memories. It has taken eons to come this far.&quot; Who were we? He surely didn't think we were the Eagle and the Jaguar.
&lt;&lt;Then you bear me no grudge?&gt;&gt; His torso was almost gone, just shoulders and a blob for his head.
&quot;We bear you no grudge, Brass. We ask that you do likewise.&quot;
&lt;&lt;I will hold no grudges then...&gt;&gt; His thoughts were fading out, his head half gone. &lt;&lt;Farewell...&gt;&gt; his final thought seemed to be a name, something like aranhir, but that doesn't ring any bells with either Nalini or myself.
We could not relinquish these forms while we held the heart, for its powers would tear us to shreds. We had to get the others home. &quot;Gather round, it's time to go!&quot;
Nalini nestled her jaguar head against my shoulder. In these forms we towered over everyone else. Hampton Court dining hall. All of us. We willed, and it was so.
I staggered and fell against Nalini, who staggered and fell against Durathror. &quot;You must destroy the heart now!&quot;
Yellow light pulsed between our fingers, staining everything around a sickly color. We sucked power from the heart, stood upright again. Several thoughts chased through our minds.
Why destroy the heart? With it in existence, the god could move to manifest again. All he had to do was to gain possession of his heart, and his doorway into shadows was open. If we threw it away, he could be back next week. Or it could be dropped into the deepest ocean, or sealed inside a dark cave, protected by religious fanatics, and it might take him centuries to reclaim his heart.
The heart would also be a mighty temptation for mortals, it would grant the holder god like powers, as we had seen, including immortality. Of course, most mortals would be burned to ash should they try to touch it, but Brass could work through his heart and prevent that. Nalini and I were now demigods. We could use the heart to do much good in the world. Brass could not wrest it from our control without destroying it. Others less scrupulous would also try to wrest control of the object from us. But we would be superior, we would prevail, and become gods ourselves.
&lt;&lt;Such powers would corrupt you, bit by bit, till you became like Brass. He is still there, still in contact with his heart, and trying to influence your thoughts.&gt;&gt; Durathror was still linked, as were Imladril and Iskandor.
True, he was there. Slowly he would exert control, endeavoring to possess our bodies and make them his own. Exactly how this would work we were not sure, we weren't ordinary mortals.
While these thoughts buzzed around the surface of our minds, deep below, something vast and cold made a decision. &quot;Power must be earned, and built slowly. Gods must grow into being. Brass, you overstepped the bounds when you captured these and spirited them to your realm. Your heart is forfeit!&quot;
Our hands contracted, squeezing the heart. It seemed to beat wildly beneath our fingers, then with a noise like thunder it splintered and glittery yellow shards ran through our fingers and onto the floor. Prospero stood nearby, a strange look on his face, flexing his right hand. Amrik stood beside him massaging his belly. Durathror rubbed his eyes.
&quot;It is finished!&quot; We felt our bodies shifting, changing back into their normal forms. Everything spun suddenly, the vast cold being retreated to infinity, and we collapsed like rag dolls.</Text>

            <Text>Chapter 10
A little later, we were all seated around a large table, drinking spirits. Even the puritans seemed to be in need of some for medicinal purposes. We all felt as if we had just awakened from a really nasty nightmare. There was nothing to indicate that anything physical had happened save for the shards of yellow crystal on the floor, and the fact that nagging aches and pains had vanished. Nalini and I had questions, but Durathror had indicated he would answer them later. Now was the time to assuage any fears of the English.
Cromwell spoke slowly, speaking for most of us. &quot;What really happened earlier? I would almost believe it a dream, save my arthritis no longer troubles me.&quot;
Durathror nodded. &quot;You should consider it a dream, one in which Brass sought to destroy our souls. However, God in his infinite wisdom chose to interfere on your behalves. Or you could consider it as a physical experience. Either way, we were all within a cat's whisker of destruction.&quot;
There was general nodding and noises of agreement:
&quot;'Twas like a nightmare!&quot;
&quot;It seemed I was cut in pieces!&quot;
&quot;I thought I lost a leg...&quot;
&quot;...a hand...&quot;
&quot;...an eye...&quot;
&quot;I thought I was disemboweled, and would die painfully. Far better the headsman's axe than that!&quot; Charles unconsciously rubbed his belly.
&quot;And I thought I should bleed to death because my arm was all but hacked off.&quot; Cromwell looked grim for a moment. &quot;I think we have proved to ourselves that the devil sets traps for all of us, and his traps are both deadly and subtle. We must thank god for delivering us, and all of you for fighting with us in this. What manner of demon was this Brass?&quot;
&quot;Now that is difficult to explain. There is a hierarchy of beings, all with different powers. I am not prepared to explain that in detail. Suffice it to say that there are the old gods, who are barred from these realms, and there are the young gods who can interact here. Many are capricious, uncaring, and behave like spoilt brats. You would probably call them demons, but they are not, they are more like earthly despots. Each god has his or her own realm. They cannot manifest in the physical world without a heart. That of Brass has been destroyed.&quot;
&quot;Why did he not die immediately when his heart was removed?&quot;
&quot;He is a god, his spirit is powerful. His body died once the heart was removed, but until his heart was destroyed there was little to stop him reclaiming it and making a new body. He must now set about creating a new heart before he can return. But do not worry, that will take hundreds or even thousands of years.&quot;
Cromwell turned to indicate Nalini and I. &quot;What manner of beings are these two, if they could destroy a demon?&quot;
Durathror permitted himself a smile. &quot;They had help from above. Otherwise they are as human as the rest of us.&quot;
Cromwell permitted himself a slight smile. &quot;I never thought I should see the day when an elf would describe himself as human. You realize that the existence of gods is not something I had admitted in the past. For me, there is only one god, and all the rest are demons.&quot;
&quot;But does not god in the Old Testament tell Moses that we must have no other gods before him? He does not say he is the only god, and the rest are demons or false gods, only that there are many gods, but we must worship only him?&quot;
&quot;That is true. I had overlooked that.&quot;
&quot;I think we all overlooked that&quot; Charles submitted &quot;thinking that the roman gods were but figments or demons. If these gods exist, then are they a danger to us?&quot;
&quot;They are all a danger to us!&quot; Cromwell responded indignantly.
&quot;I am not talking about worship. I meant do they pose a threat to we Christians? Are some of those primitive pagan tribes worshiping powerful gods that could harm us?&quot;
Durathror shook his head slowly. &quot;Gods have powers, but they are barred from acting directly. Instead they must go through human agents, or manifest as a human, which usually requires going through the birth process. There are those like Brass who try to act directly from time to time, but if they step over the bounds of what is permitted, they set in motion the process to redress that. He overstepped the bounds with us, so the process of redress acted through us. We were lucky to survive, it could so easily have gone differently, with Brass banished and the rest of us destroyed.&quot;
Cromwell pursed his lips. &quot;I fear I viewed the world too narrowly in the past, and that lead to my errors. I believe we shall all read our bibles in new light and understanding, based on our recent experiences. Is it really finished though? Nothing else will come to haunt our dreams, and tempt us into evil?&quot;
&quot;It is finished, Brass is no more. His minions will not trouble you. You may all sleep safely in your beds. But&quot; Durathror wagged his finger at Cromwell &quot;You have set yourselves up as the moral authority on earth, as God's own representatives. Others will seek to pull you from that pedestal. God himself will test you, and punish you if you fall short. He has already tested you once, and found all of you wanting. Remember that if you set yourself in authority over others, then you will be judged all the more harshly, for you must set the example.&quot;
Argyll looked at Cromwell, then at Durathror. &quot;I think we shall be doubly wary from now on.&quot;
Cromwell shook his head, turned and spoke to the others. &quot;We set ourselves up as God's representatives, prince Durathror is right. God did not appoint us, we appointed ourselves. In our pride we have made many mistakes, and God tested us and found us sorely wanting. I for one will devote the rest of my life to rectifying the evil we have done in God's name!&quot;
The others echoed his sentiments. &quot;The parliament will revoke all the evil laws it has passed. We are agreed on that.&quot; Argyll added. &quot;And we shall restore the king to his throne. It is the pattern that god in his infinite wisdom has set, we should not look to set his patterns aside.&quot;
Charles added &quot;Gentlemen, I have also realized that I was not as good a king as I should be. I too acted from pride. I have agreed to the curbs on the powers of the monarch, now I desire that we all work together to put England back on her feet, and make her the best country on earth. Cromwell, I wish you to remain as the Lord Protector, someone must lead the parliament, I think we have learned to respect one another.&quot;
&quot;I thank you, my king. I believe we can work well together. I have always respected the monarchy.&quot; Cromwell suddenly raised his glass. &quot;A toast. To King Charles, long may he reign!&quot; Everyone drank.
Charles responded &quot;We should meet here tomorrow to finalize the details of the government, and sign the agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, we will have much work on the morrow, I suggest we not tarry overlong tonight.&quot;
&quot;Is it safe to go to sleep?&quot; one of the puritans asked.
&quot;As safe as any other time.&quot; Durathror replied. &quot;Brass can no longer invade your dreams, his minions are scattered and lack direction. Any problems you encounter will be of your own making.&quot;
Cromwell observed &quot;I do not think I will ever regard dreaming in quite the same way now. It is quite a shock to realize that one's dreams are as real as waking.&quot;
Charles smiled &quot;And I shall not regard four stone walls and iron bars as a secure prison when I know that there are those who can walk into a parallel world. The more so to think that there are many parallel worlds all around us even now. The world is suddenly much stranger than it seemed only a few weeks ago.&quot;
&quot;It makes one feel very small and insignificant, does it not?&quot; Matthew added. &quot;I will no longer have quite the same certainty that I know what god wants me to do. I think we have all realized we are human, and fallible.&quot;
&quot;And gentlemen, I trust that all of you will act with more compassion toward your fellow man, and be forgiving of the sinners, as Jesus did.&quot; Durathror was smiling, and there was a twinkle in his eye.
Cromwell and Matthew looked at one another, Matthew spoke. &quot;We have much reform work to do, and some of the tenets of our faith need to be reconsidered in the light of what we have learned. We call ourselves the New Covenanters, it is a shock to realize we had more in common with the old than the new.&quot;
We talked a little longer, then adjourned for the night. As our group walked along the corridor toward the wing we occupied, Amrik clapped an arm around my shoulder, and one around Durathror's. &quot;I trust you will join me for a night cap?&quot; A little later, those of us from other shadows gathered in Amrik's stateroom for more discussion. Prince Rupert accompanied us.
&quot;By the gods Durathror, I have never been so close to dying as this evening!&quot; Amrik exclaimed as he sat down on a chair. &quot;Feeling my entrails spill onto the ground was an experience I hope never to repeat! I want no more truck with gods!&quot; He gestured for all of us to sit and help ourselves to drinks. Everyone did.
&quot;I am inclined to agree. This is twice we have faced down a god, but each time we have won.&quot; Durathror responded. &quot;We have tales to tell our grandchildren!&quot;
&quot;If we live that long! But only because of Danny and Nalini. Without them we would all be dead.&quot;
&quot;Without them this may never have started.&quot; Durathror opined. &quot;They were the ones who walked into Rupert's shadow in the first place.&quot;
&quot;Actually, it was Paula and Prospero.&quot; I commented. &quot;They were navigating and shifting, we were just supervising.&quot;
&quot;But had they not ventured into my shadow, I should be dead these past five weeks, my bones bleaching on Marston moor.&quot; Rupert added.
&quot;And you have to admit that much of what happened over the past few weeks was for Prospero rather than anyone else.&quot; Imladril added.
&quot;Prospero! This is the last time I go shadow walking with you!&quot; Amrik stated gruffly.
Prospero held up his right hand, flexed it. &quot;The battle you can walk away from can't be all bad. Now that I am alive and in one piece, I can say that I am glad to have been through the adventure. But I feel I have seen enough adventure for some time to come. I hope never again to see my own hand sailing through the air gripping my sword!&quot;
Rupert snorted. &quot;I have the singular experience of actually dying, watching the battle from somewhere overhead, and then being restored to life. Is that what truly happens, that we float away from our dead bodies?&quot;
&quot;Yes, and you go into the dreaming.&quot; Ra'anor responded.
We discussed the process of dying and death for some minutes before Rupert observed &quot;It is almost as if I was rescued from one death, and had to pay for that by another. How was I resurrected?&quot;
&quot;We had his heart in our possession...&quot;
&quot;...and with it we were able to will is so...&quot;
&quot;The god's heart confers his powers upon the holder. There are several sagas told of gods who have had their hearts stolen, and adventurers who seek their hearts. To possess a god's heart is to become a god, but unless you are already a god, or unless the god uses his powers to protect you, the first time you try to use it would burn you to ash.&quot;
&quot;Why did that fate not befall Danny and Nalini? And how did they manage to destroy the god? Is it some power in their dagger, or are they gods themselves?&quot;
&quot;That is something Danny and I are very curious about as well. There is power in our gems, but there seemed to be a core buried within us that opened to release that power.&quot;
&quot;And we remembered dying on a chaos blade back in the dim past.&quot; I added.
&quot;And Brass thought he recognized us as he died. He whispered some name.&quot;
Durathror held up both hands to gain attention. &quot;I was linked with you two while the process happened, and since I had my own eyes burned out, I had much interest in observing through your eyes. I do not know for certain what happened, but I can give you my opinion.&quot;
I think we all leaned forward to hear better. Durathror looked around our group, then looked directly at Nalini and myself. His gaze seemed reflective, slightly sad. &quot;I know what you two think, that once upon a time you were gods yourselves, and that you have an unbreakable bond. That in some long forgotten battle, eons ago, Nalini died upon a chaos blade, and Danny in his grief followed her. A chaos blade destroys both body and soul, and will destroy the essence of a god if wielded by another god. No one else could handle the release of power. I know I threatened Brass with his own blade, but had I tried to use it, I would have died. If that had happened to Danny and Nalini, neither of them would now exist.&quot;
&quot;But Durathror, we are not gods, we cannot say whether it happened and that they survived.&quot; Imladril interrupted. &quot;That could be one reason for the Eagle arranging for them to be given their gems.&quot;
&quot;You are right sister, we cannot truly say. This is my own opinion, but it is based upon what I observed. I will grant that it is possible that both were once gods, and somehow managed to avoid the final death. But I do not think it is the case.&quot;
&quot;Then how did they survive the chaos blade this time, and manage to turn the god's heart against him? How did they survive the previous time against the serpent?&quot; Amrik countered.
Durathror smiled. &quot;Amrik my friend, I am working my way to explaining that, if you will let me. Danny and Nalini are soulmates, that we know. That is a bond stronger than almost any other. But being soulmates is a very intense experience, they are thrown together for a life, many things happen, some of them quite painful. They spend their next lives apart, and go around ever feeling empty, half alive, because their other half is missing. They have been through much over their many lives, but they are not gods, any more than you or I are.&quot;
He paused to drink some wine. &quot;Talking's thirsty work! Now, both Danny and Nalini have progressed to the point where they can become sorcerers. I do not find it strange that the workings of power singles them out to give them a gift of power.&quot;
&quot;What do you mean by the workings of power?&quot; Rupert queried.
&quot;I could argue that the eagle could foresee the adventures they would have, and so gave them a gift that would enable him to play a part against the gods they will encounter. Twice now I have been present when they have banished gods who overstepped the boundaries. That gives me reason to think that I should avoid any further adventures that they become embroiled in!&quot; He smiled as he said it.
&quot;Brother, you would be bored if you could not have adventures, and you gain much pleasure in retelling the tale of the time they banished the serpent god.&quot;
&quot;You know me well.&quot; Durathror admitted. &quot;Yes, I shall probably become embroiled in other adventures they have, and I suspect most strongly that they will have other adventures.
&quot;Now, as I was saying, they are ordinary mortals, but they are also fledgling sorcerers. So the workings of power arranged for Fin mak Morn to give them each a gift: Nalini has a ring with a magic gem, while Danny has a dagger set with a similar gem. We know the gems are magical, they have many power connections. Right now, many of them are dormant, but that is probably for the best. They are still young in the ways of sorcery, they will need years to grow into power. I want all of you to consider for a moment: to whom did those magic artifacts belong?&quot;
There was silence, and much looking at one another. &quot;Some god, or perhaps a long dead sorcerer?&quot; Amrik hazarded.
Durathror smiled. &quot;With all due respect, I would prefer if my kin tried to answer, they should be in a better position to answer.&quot;
Imladril looked at him. &quot;Brother, I cannot hazard any better guess than Amrik. We know that Fin mak Morn associated with many dead gods and heroes, many of them from the foremost shadows, closest to the archetype. It could be any of a number of beings.&quot;
Durathror smiled and twirled his moustache. &quot;Ah, I keep forgetting that none of you have spent much time with such. I have the advantage then, through Korum I know something more about the primary shadows.&quot;
He turned to the rest of us. &quot;Some of you know most of this, but I ask you to bear with me while I explain to those who do not.&quot; He waved his right hand. &quot;Behind everything is what we call the mind of god. Everything that exists, including gods and demons, the world of dreaming, heavens and hells, all are part of the mind of god. The mind of god dreams, and one of its dreams is the archetypes.&quot;
He waved his left hand. &quot;We know of perhaps eleven thousand different archetypes, there are undoubtedly many more. Rupert, every archetype is different, and sets the pattern for the realm it creates. For example, some archetypes correspond loosely with the four elements, the realms they create are quite different from what we are used to. The mind of god is the light, the archetypes are the source of shadow. Each one casts an infinite number of shadows. Rupert, shadows are the alternate worlds we have traveled through. Our own archetype is that of Duality, Order and Chaos, for neither can exist without the other, like two sides of a coin. Part of the archetype is beings we call the Old Gods. Supreme amongst those are the Eagle and the Serpent. It is wrong to think of them as good and evil, but rather as Order and Chaos, but each has part of both natures, this is because of our archetype. I won't explain this in detail, we would be here all night discussing metaphysics.&quot;
He held up his left hand again. &quot;Remember that the light is the Mind of God, it shines upon the Old Gods, and they cast shadows of their own. These shadows we refer to as the New Gods, they are not as powerful as the old gods, but they interfere more in our lives.&quot;
&quot;Was Brass a New God?&quot;
&quot;Yes Amrik, and he still is. By destroying his heart we have banished him from shadow until he can create a new one, but he still exists out there somewhere. No Prospero, don't ask me where banished gods go.&quot;
Durathror held up his left hand and moved his right hand around it in a flat circle. &quot;The new gods also cast shadows, powerful human like beings that inhabit the primary shadows. We usually refer to these beings collectively as the Lesser Gods. Some of you know Korum, who by his own admission hales from the primary shadow. He is, to all intents and purposes, a god, albeit a lesser god. I think he would be an equal of Brass in power though. All the denizens from the primary shadows have the potential to create and uncreate shadow, though not many have ever mastered the power required. Korum is one who has.&quot;
&quot;Korum taught me shadow shifting&quot; Nalini announced. &quot;I knew he was a powerful sorcerer, but I never thought he was that powerful.&quot;
There was a twinkle in Durathror's eye. &quot;Korum likes to masquerade as a simple warrior. He doesn't like to be treated like a god. You are very fortunate he is your friend.&quot;
He waved his hands at us. &quot;Let me explain. The shadows spread out from the archetype something like the layers of an onion. The gods both old and new exist somewhere before shadows begin, and so are forbidden to walk in shadow except under controlled conditions that severely limit their powers. The first layer around the archetype is referred to as the primary shadows, or the foremost shadows. They are shadows of the archetype itself. Lesser gods like Korum come from the primary shadows. Because they are shadows, they can walk in shadow without limit to their powers. This is why I said that Korum is as powerful as Brass.&quot;
He looked directly at Liz and Rupert. &quot;The onion simile is not quite correct, but it will do. Imagine the next layer out, this consists of shadows that are shadows of the primary shadows. Does that make sense?&quot; Liz nodded.
Rupert asked &quot;You mean that in some odd way, my shadow on the table here could make shadows of its own?&quot;
&quot;That is the concept, although you need to realize that the light is the mind of god, and the shadows are quite powerful beings. A shadow is a pale copy of the original, so the shadows of the lesser gods like Korum are powerful sorcerers, but nowhere near his powers. It progresses outwards from there. We are perhaps seven layers removed from the source, we are not very powerful.&quot;
&quot;How many layers are there? How difficult is it to travel between them?&quot;
Durathror smiled a rueful smile. &quot;The layers stretch to infinity. We would be hard pressed to journey from one layer to the next in less than three or four weeks of continuous travel. Almost all our travels are within our own layer.&quot;
&quot;This is all very interesting, but what does it have to do with Danny and Nalini, or their gems?&quot;
&quot;Ah, friend Amrik, I am laying down the background for my explanation. There is one more thing I want to say about gods. I used the words 'power to create and uncreate shadows', but none of you asked me what I meant.&quot;
&quot;Did you not mean as you explained, that Brass casts shadows, one of which is Korum, and he casts shadows?&quot;
&quot;I feared that might be how you would interpret my words Rupert. When I use the terms create and uncreate I have something more specific in mind. If we go back to our onion simile, consider that most onions have only one heart, but there are some that have more than one, with layers about each heart. I cannot think of better words in English, but shadows are like the onion with many hearts. The main heart is the archetype, the secondary hearts are created by beings with the power to create shadows. Korum is such a being, as is Brass. He abducted us to his own realm, his own set of created shadows. Without his heart, I doubt very much that any of us could have returned from there.&quot;
&quot;You mean we'd have been trapped there until we died?&quot;
&quot;Perhaps. I would have done my utmost to contact Korum in dreaming, he would have the power to rescue us, but we would have been trapped until he could.&quot;
&quot;Why is it so difficult to return from Brass' realm?&quot;
&quot;Because it is so distant. If you consider our onion again, a second heart forms some distance from the center. We are from one of the inner layers, there are many layers between that and the layers around the second heart. The main problem though is that there is a gap between his realm and the... er... main realm. Where we were, that gap is wider than I could cross. It was so wide, I could not perceive shadows on the other side.&quot;
There was silence for a number of heartbeats while we digested this. Durathror took another drink, then continued &quot;The gems are power objects. A power object is an item that has links to power sources off in shadow somewhere. A powerful sorcerer can make one, but the power of such an object is limited by the power of the sorcerer himself. I will not explain how to make a power object, but the sorcerer must be able to command the power of the source to which the power object is linked. These power objects have many hundreds of links, though as I said, most are dormant. The only ones available at present are those that are the least powerful. I believe that only one of the gods could make these particular power objects.&quot;
&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;
&quot;Because the links I traced are to power sources in other realms, created by gods. Only someone at least as powerful as Korum could travel to other realms and link the gems to those sources.&quot; He noted Prospero's raised eyebrows. &quot;Prospero, one of the links was to Brass's own realm, to the lake of blood in which he keeps part of his being. He knows who created those gems. He even used the being's name as he was dying. He believed that Danny and Nalini were the reincarnation of the gem's original owners.&quot;
&quot;Well, we thought we might be as well.&quot;
&quot;Aren't we?&quot;
&quot;I have admitted it is possible, but unlikely. What I think happened was that the original owners did indeed die as Danny and Nalini remember. Some of their memories remained in the gems after their deaths. This is the core that hides from you, and opens when either of you are threatened with destruction. Why the eagle has given you such powerful gifts we can only speculate, but I would venture to suggest that banishing gods might be part of it.&quot;
&quot;I would say they have changed hands many times since their owners died, and were doubtless the reason why they died.&quot; Amrik stated. &quot;I would even guess that others will seek to take the gems from them.&quot;
Durathror nodded at these words, becoming serious. &quot;I agree with you friend Amrik. The gems carry their own dangers. Using them will attract attention. In the years to come, you two will have to defend your ownership of those gems. I think the eagle will help you there: I do not believe he would have arranged for you to be given those gifts unless there were safeguards to protect you. I am sure that what happened to Brass is one of those safeguards.&quot;
&quot;We didn't realize they were that powerful...&quot;
&quot;We assumed that what ever power was there mostly burned out during the confrontation with the serpent.&quot;
&quot;So did we.&quot; Durathror nodded. &quot;But now we know it wasn't, and that the links go to power sources in other realms. None of us can handle that sort of power.&quot;
&quot;So what are we supposed to do with the gems?&quot;
&quot;Where can we put them for safe keeping?&quot;
&quot;There is nowhere you could put them that would be safe. They are linked to you now, they will come when you summon them, regardless of where you put them. You could drop them in the deepest ocean, where only the gods could go, and still the gems would come to you when you called. The gods themselves cannot take them from you because they must destroy your souls to break the link with the gems, and as we have seen, the core will not allow that. Ignorant sorcerers can kill your bodies to possess the gems though. Doing that would not break the link, and the gems would find their way back to you in the next life...&quot; He trailed off, looking thoughtful.
&quot;Brother, does that not imply that they were given the gems by Fin mak Morn because they are linked from some previous life? How many lifetimes could that link stretch back?&quot;
Durathror snorted. &quot;I know what you are thinking sister, but I will not agree that these two are what is left of banished gods. We can only speculate on what has happened to the gems since their creators died. No doubt they passed through many hands...&quot;
Imladril smiled and shook her head. &quot;You know as well as I do that the link can only be broken by the destruction of the spirit, unless they willingly give the gems to someone else. I think that in the core there is sentience as well as memory. The gems have chosen Danny and Nalini for a reason. That suggests to me that they are the remnants of the gems' creators...&quot;
Durathror laughed and shook his head. &quot;Perhaps the core is a window to one of the banished gods and the two are the proteges of that god. Sister, they are not fallen gods, their auras are human. The power we observed today came from the hidden core inside the gems.&quot; He held up his right forefinger. &quot;That is a separate entity. I am almost convinced it is one of the old gods taking a passing interest in the antics of humans. It has that feel of vastness, coldness, detachment and remoteness.&quot;
Imladril pursed her lips thoughtfully. &quot;It did have that feel.&quot; She nodded. &quot;Perhaps you are right brother, but only time will tell.&quot;
Durathror smiled, nodding. &quot;And we both know that this is not the end of their story. I just hope that the next time they involve us in some dangerous undertaking we do not come quite so close to being destroyed.&quot;
&quot;I'll drink to that!&quot; Amrik exclaimed.
All of which left Nalini and me feeling a little short changed and a little aggrieved. We would prefer life to be a little more predictable, and offer less lurking dangers.
We stayed one more day, spending some time helping the parliament write out the agreement. The king and Cromwell signed it that evening, and the rump parliament assembled ratified the agreement immediately.
The next day Paula, Prospero, Liz, Nalini and I said our goodbyes to the others after breakfast. We promised to be back for the investiture of King Charles in about two weeks. Amrik hugged all of us, and bade us visit him in Aquilonia soon.
&quot;You are overdue to visit us Amrik!&quot; Nalini countered.
&quot;I know, but I might inconvenience Prospero, he'd feel obliged to bow and scrape before me.&quot; Amrik laughed.
&quot;Hah! I don't do that back in Aquilonia. Why should I do that in Brisbane?&quot;
&quot;Okay&quot; he responded, using the English word, &quot;If you promise we'll behave like friends, I'll visit as soon as I can make the time.&quot;
Cromwell, King Charles and several other puritans made the effort to see us off as well.
Charles made the surprising gesture of clasping each of us by the hand. &quot;Fare you well, all of you. I owe each of you more than I can ever repay.&quot;
When he shook my hand, I replied &quot;Rather than thinking of repaying a debt of gratitude, pass it on to others. Help those you can. If we all do that, the world will be a better place. We need no other recompense.&quot;
He nodded at this, and smiled. &quot;You are wise beyond your years, Lord Daniel. A king must beware of being in debt of gratitude, it gives others leverage over his actions. I will endeavor to pass it on, as you suggest.&quot;
Nalini commented &quot;You should come to visit us from time to time. I think you will appreciate being able to get away from the cares of kingship for a time.&quot;
&quot;Thank you young lady. A king can trust no one completely, everyone seeks his favor. Over the past few weeks I have learned that being plain Mr. Charles Stuart has attractions at times. I shall visit when I can find the time. You must all return here to visit us from time to time. You will always be welcome.&quot;
Prospero commented &quot;Thank you your majesty. You must visit Aquilonia as well. You are embarking on a new path here with parliament, our two kingdoms can benefit from each other's experience. You will always be welcome with us.&quot;
Cromwell then shook hands with all of us as well. &quot;It seems strange to shake a lady's hand, but there is something equitable about it. I believe I owe all of you my soul: I unwittingly walked the road to hell, thinking I was doing God's work. You have opened my eyes, and those of my brethren. May God be with you all in your journey, and may you return here swiftly and safely.&quot;
To Nalini and me he added &quot;At first I thought you two were in league with the devil, but now I am sure are messengers from god, or perhaps angels in disguise. I own that you have abused my sensibilities many times over the past few weeks, but I have learned that I was too stiff necked, and had misunderstood the scriptures. We will be re-evaluating our interpretation of God's holy words. Promise me you will bring books on scriptural interpretation so we may learn from them.&quot;
&quot;We promise, Lord Cromwell. There are differences between our interpretations, some you may not agree with. But I believe that God in his wisdom gives each of us instruction that causes us to stretch beyond our comfort zones.&quot;
&quot;It is a continuing process&quot; Nalini added. &quot;We stretch and feel uncomfortable, then we grow accustomed to it, and it becomes our new comfort zone. We must then stretch again.&quot;
&quot;Aye.&quot; He nodded and smiled. &quot;That you treat Catholics and Protestants alike is a marvel to us, but your actions have shown us that there is something inherently right about that. We have much to learn.&quot;
&quot;We are all learning.&quot; Nalini responded. &quot;Tolerance is something that must be practiced by those who are intollerant, but the victims must also learn tolerance, otherwise they will perpetuate the intolerance by behaving as victims.&quot;
He nodded and grunted as if he hadn't understood some of that. Nalini added &quot;You may aim to treat Catholics and Protestants as equals, but each person must also learn they are equal, otherwise they will still see others' behaviour as evidence of intolerance, and imagine slights where none were meant.&quot;
&quot;Ah. I understand that. You have wisdom and insights we must aspire to.&quot;
Prospero added &quot;Lord Cromwell, you are embarking on a course of changes for your culture. One thing I must advise is that change must be managed, and must proceed in careful stages so that everyone may follow along. Too swift and you will have a peasant's revolt on your hands.&quot;
&quot;Yes, you speak in terms I find easier to understand. I know our cultures are different. I freely admit that I believe our English culture is superior to any other; but I believe we can learn things from your culture as well.&quot;
&quot;Cromwell, our own culture is English, though you have not seen it. It may disconcert you to know that in our past walked a King Charles and Lord Cromwell. But the events in our past turned out differently from those here. We are not from your future, though in many ways we are what your culture will develop into.&quot;
He nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I do not fully understand all of that, I need to think on it some more. However, I do appreciate that you see things differently from us, and that those different perspectives seem to be scripture based. When I contrast some of the things you describe with how we behave, there seems to be an innate rightness to yours. This is why I want books from your culture on the interpretation of the bible. I believe that your theologians may have insights we do not.&quot; He stepped back, smiled. &quot;I shall look forward to your return. May God go with all of you.&quot;
&quot;And may the blessings of God be upon all of you who remain here.&quot; I responded.
Prince Rupert wished all of us Godspeed. To me he said quietly &quot;I pray you bring the lady Elizabeth back. I have found I have grown quite fond of her.&quot;
&quot;If Liz is willing, we will bring her back.&quot;
Nalini added &quot;Don't forget you must seek us in dreaming if you want training. It would be good if you could train together.&quot;
&quot;I have set my heart upon it. Now I must find a way to accomplish it.&quot;
&quot;You will Rupert. We are both sure of it.&quot;
He turned to Liz, took her hands. They both stood silently looking at one another. Finally he remarked formally &quot;My lady, I hope we shall meet again&quot; and bent to kiss her hand.
Liz forestalled that by stepping forward and hugging him fiercely. &quot;We're a bit less formal where I come from Rupert.&quot; His hands moved awkwardly to hug her in return. &quot;I will be back to visit. But remember what I said, don't make promises you can't keep. Just... see how things develop.&quot; She stood back. When she spoke again, her voice was huskier. &quot;Take care Rupert. There will always be a special place for you in my heart.&quot;
For a moment Rupert looked as if he was about to cry, but instead he smiled, drew himself up. &quot;You have pride of place in mine Elizabeth. Return soon, I pray.&quot;
 The five of us rode across the castle courtyard and through the main gate, turning toward London. No one spoke until I had made the first shift for our shadow Brisbane. Nalini and I took turns shifting.
&quot;I should like to spend some time having nothing to do with shadows, gods or anything else!&quot; Prospero announced. &quot;I'm looking forward to modern plumbing too!&quot;
&quot;Me too!&quot; Liz announced.
&quot;Don't say that in Rupert's hearing, you'll break his heart.&quot; Paula quipped.
&quot;I think I already have.&quot;
&quot;Why? Did he ask you to marry him or something?&quot; Paula persisted.
&quot;Something like that.&quot; Liz said neutrally.
&quot;Hah! That's a turn up for the books! A German prince falling for an Australian Aboriginal!&quot;
&quot;Paula!&quot; Nalini cautioned.
&quot;Yes, it probably is.&quot; Liz replied carefully.
&quot;Oh, I didn't mean that how it sounded! Liz, you know I didn't. So you broke his heart huh? Turned him down? Tell us about it.&quot;
&quot;Um... I don't really feel like talking right now.&quot;
&quot;Paula, I think Rupert isn't the only one with a broken heart.&quot; Nalini observed.
&quot;Oh sorry! But hey, this is girl talk! Liz, talking about it will make you feel better.&quot;
Liz however refused to talk. We rode for an hour or so through changing landscapes, past soaring mountain ranges and deep lakes, past angry seas and calm ones, over snow and desert, through forest of various types, under skies of many hues.
It grew warmer, and we found ourselves riding through landscapes reminiscent of south east Asia at home. Our road was a dirt track, and dark skinned people worked fields or rode carts drawn by horses or oxen. Others walked, driving cattle and pigs before them. The people were small bodied, the women clad in wrap around toga like clothing, the men in little more than dirty loin cloths.
We dodged a tropical rainstorm just as the fat drops began to fall, finding ourselves on the outskirts of a modern city. We rode along the grass verge of a paved road. Gaudily painted trucks and vehicles resembling jeepneys careened past amid much honking of horns. Brown skinned people rode upon motor scooters or push bikes. Modern looking three and four story buildings sat back from the road, their awnings providing shade for pedestrians. Many people turned to stare at us as we rode past on horseback.
&quot;Should we sidetrack?&quot;
&quot;There seem to be cities all around us. If we keep to the open line, we will probably ride right through in a few shifts.&quot;
On foot we have no problem travelling through most cities, especially polyglot modern ones, but horses can cause problems in modern cities. We selected an open line into a park, and then realized we had not made the best choice. Ahead was a crowd of people, chanting, screaming, skirmishing. From our vantage point it appeared that the crowd was attacking a small group of people in the center. With hindsight, we did not make the safest choice, but possibly the workings of power meant we made the optimal choice.
Prospero took out his binoculars and studied the scene for a few moments. &quot;It appears the crowd is attacking a small group of women, and is intent on gang raping them.&quot;
Nalini took the binoculars from him, studied the scene herself. &quot;It looks like they've rounded up about fifteen women. They're beating them and stripping them.&quot; She handed the binoculars back, grim faced. &quot;It's a big crowd, but I don't want to leave the women to their mercy. They'll be gang raped at least.&quot;
&quot;We're on horseback, we have guns. We must rescue them!&quot; Prospero spoke with fervor.
&quot;We need enough show of force to scare them off. Guns may do it. At least these are trained war horses.&quot; A trained war-horse is worth several foot soldiers in a battle. It is big, doesn't scare, and can kill an armored man with one kick. On foot, we'd have had little hope of forcing a way through the crowd, and would have had to search out shadows that allowed us to go around. &quot;What about Liz?&quot; Paula asked.
&quot;She has a warrior's spirit, like the rest of us.&quot; I responded. &quot;Liz, you'd best stay on your horse, and guard the others when we get off.&quot;
&quot;Okay.&quot; She unholstered her gun, readied it.
&quot;Are we ready?&quot; Nalini asked. We assented. &quot;Let's ride!&quot;
Our horses are unusual, being red with black tiger style stripes. They are about the size of a Clydesdale, but can muster several times the speed on the flat. We nudged the horses into a canter.
Prospero, Nalini and I were aware of the dangers of the situation we'd glossed over. The problem was, we were five against several hundred. If the crowd consisted of warriors, such a press would have little trouble pulling us from our horses and killing us. Crowds being crowds, we were probably reasonably safe on horseback, all things considered. However, to be able to rescue the women, we couldn't just stay on our horses, but must get down amongst the crowd and bluff them. Somehow we had to scare enough people, clear a space and rescue the women. Guns and horses would clear a space for a time, but then what? We could drag the women through shadow, but we would have to put them back somewhere.
&lt;&lt;Worry about that after we rescue them!&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Hey, I like to worry, especially if it's about how to stay alive.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;If we're quick, we'll get away safely.&gt;&gt;
As we neared the back of the crowd, Prospero uttered an ululating war cry similar to Amrik's, from whom he'd probably copied it. It is designed to freeze the blood of the foe. He followed it with two shots into the air, which the rest of us echoed. The crowd panicked, and parted like the red sea for Moses. Those unable to get out of the way were either shoved physically aside by our horses, or trampled underfoot. Prospero had his gun in his left hand and his sword in his right, flailing around with the flat of the blade.
We barged through with little resistance. Nalini drew reign and leapt from her horse while it was still in motion, calling out some orders to the rest of us. Prospero turned his horse to face the milling crowd and caused it to rear and strike out with its hooves. I turned mine the other way and did likewise. People fell back in panic.
 Prospero and I leaped from our horses to help Nalini, while Paula and Liz stood guard. The crowd was comprised of hundreds of individuals, all males, and probably mostly under forty years of age. Many were unarmed, but some were in possession of sticks, bottles, knives or other offensive weapons. Their skin colors ranged from very pale yellow to deep coffee color. The females were more Asiatic looking, with skin colors ranging from pale yellow to medium brown. They were all young, probably mostly teenagers, while one looked to be about ten or eleven.
The girls had all been stripped by the time we reached them. Several were being held on the ground, in the process of being raped, others were being groped and pressed to the ground. The surge of anger I felt was alarming. If I'd had the power, I would have been tempted to cause all the men to burn alive or suffer some equally painful fate.
With so many people in the crowd, it was essential that rapists and attackers be neutralized as quickly and efficiently as possible. In other words, they had to be knocked unconscious, killed or injured sufficiently to render them incapable of any further threat. Knocking someone out is a precise art. Too little force and you have an angry attacker with a sore head. Too much and you will kill them. We preferred to avoid killing people if we could, and that left injuring people as the only viable option.
Nalini as first in had to solve this problem. By the time I leapt from my horse, she had already kicked three attackers in the face and a fourth in the balls. Having cleared a space around her, she immediately shot all four men in the kneecap. &quot;Kneecap all of them!&quot; she commanded.
Nalini: I think Danny had more qualms about that than the rest of us. Liz and I had both been on the receiving end of this sort of mob violence, neither of us felt much remorse about it. Prospero is a soldier, without the background of the Genieva convention - to him kneecapping was a humane alternative to killing them. Paula can be quite ruthless and bloodthirsty when she wants to be. It's partly her nature, but I think the fantasy war games she plays with her brothers and their friends are largely responsible. That left Danny to feel some pangs of guilt, and since we're telepathic I felt them too. But then Danny also has a ruthless streak, and agreed with my assessment.
Danny: For a short time there was pandemonium. We had to move fast, and we had to be ruthlessly efficient if we wanted to survive ourselves, let alone rescue the girls. In about fifteen seconds we had almost thirty men kneecapped. Nalini and I had also kneecapped most of those that Prospero tackled, which left us running low bullets. We needed a few seconds to replace the magazines, but we weren't given that chance.
A few martial artist types tried to be heroes. Four attacked me, five attacked Nalini. Perhaps they thought she was better, or perhaps they thought to take her hostage. The men were angry, but Nalini and I were spurred by a white hot fury. Several of them were good, but fortunately not good enough. Martial arts require more than physical practice, strength and prowess. The masters know that behind all the training lie energy workings. As sorcerers, we had learned that behind sorcery were energy workings, and we had been including them in our own martial arts practice for months now. We also had the advantage of being protected by our ceramic mail that absorbed and stopped any powerful blows without injury.
I was already in martial arts mode as Nalini and I term it. In such a state the mind and body seem to be one, the action flows almost without thought. Energy workings. I felt the energy flow through me from my torc. I hesitate to say I felt invulnerable, but I certainly felt something like that.
Contrary to martial arts films, real fights using martial arts techniques do not last long. The first blow must be the killing blow, there is no second chance. All four attacked at the same time, using their feet. I moved on the nearest, dodging his foot and slamming a blow into his shin with my clenched fist. The energy flow snapped the bone like a twig. The second found himself too close as he extended his foot into the kick, and changed into an attack with his knee. I blocked with the heel of my other hand, letting the energies smash his kneecap. The third smashed his foot into my back, where my coat of mail absorbed the impact. He howled as if he had hurt himself. The fourth missed. I spun, danced back at them, elbow connecting with number three's leg, fist connecting with his face, twisted my body and hit the fourth with my clenched fist to his chest. The energies flowed with each contact. Number three fell backward as if poleaxed, number four shot backwards into the crowd, knocking a number of people over.
Nalini dropped attacker number three as I turned to help. Two quick dancing steps and I punched her closest attacker above the kidneys, letting the energies break bones and mash up his insides. I turned again, to see the other attacker cop a jab to the throat. He flopped back, head loose, blood gushing from his mouth.
That short fight brought us a breathing space as other would be heroes re-evaluated their chances. We left at least half of them dead, the rest incapacitated. I made a mental note that when I had more time, I wanted to think hard about the energy workings we had used.
Several others tried to drag Paula and Liz from their horses. The horses kicked while the two girls fired into their attackers. Even those who tried to get close to the riderless horses were kicked: the horses are trained to attack everyone who approaches in a battle situation.
Another would-be hero tried to take one of the girls hostage, waving a knife around. He backed into Paula's horse; she stuck the muzzle of one of her guns into his mouth. While he was adjusting to this situation, Prospero grabbed his arm and broke it savagely.
We cleared a space around us, but I think we all realized that once the surprise wore off, our attackers would regain their courage. Things would then turn very nasty. Several times groups of men surged toward us, to be bluffed back by guns pointed directly at them. While Nalini and Prospero tried to round up the girls, I turned my attention to the gem in my dagger. I needed to keep the crowd at bay, and it belatedly dawned on me that sorcery was called for.
I didn't have time for elaborate theatrics, I needed to work something in the next thirty seconds. I activated the first link that suggested itself, and willed the crowd to know pain, fear and terror. Fire ran through my bones, while stinging insects crawled beneath my skin. I felt as if I was grasping a live wire. But I drew my sword, and faced the crowd, roaring. &quot;Maggots! Eaters of dung! Crawl back to your cesspits!&quot; Maybe not highly original, but it was what came to mind at the time.
It occurred to me later that perhaps I could have burned them with fire while the fury was upon me. Perhaps it was just as well I didn't think of it then. But the sorcery worked, the crowd around us panicked and trampled each other as they tried to flee. I kept the sorcery up for a few minutes until we had a reasonable clearing around us, then dropped it. I felt as if a heavy weight boxer had been using me for a punching bag.
This left us in the middle of the park with about forty five injured men, about nine or ten dead ones, and fifteen hysterical girls. Many were injured: bruises showing, cuts and abrasions, one girl was bleeding where a nipple had been torn off, several had been raped, one anally. We gathered up their clothes and prepared to decamp for a safer shadow where we could debate what to do next.
Liz, Paula and Nalini were all grim faced, trying to comfort the girls. Prospero looked at me and said &quot;We prevailed. I had my doubts you know.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;What can we do about filth like these?&quot;
&quot;I had my doubts too. We seemed too few. But then we are all warriors and sorcerers. Kneecapping is probably better than they deserve.&quot;
&quot;So this is kneecapping? I have heard the word before, now I have seen it. I think it's a suitable punishment. But Nalini surprised me, I didn't think she was that ruthless.&quot;
&quot;You forget that she has been on the receiving end of such treatment.&quot;
&quot;Oh. Yes... &quot; His head lifted as he stared into the distance for a moment. &quot;They are returning, with what looks like a truck load of soldiers.&quot;
I looked around as he spoke. A battered army truck was bumping across the park toward us, while the brave crowd slunk along behind, howling threats. &quot;I don't think they're friendly. We'd better leave now.&quot;
Unfortunately it took longer for us to ready our charges than was available. The truck accelerated when they spotted us, stopping near by to deploy about a dozen armed soldiers.
&quot;Shit! Prospero, stall them while Danny and I disarm them!&quot;
&lt;&lt;Lover, can we fetch their guns?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;With a little assistance from the gems. Let's do it!&gt;&gt;
We were fortunate the soldiers didn't immediately open fire, but their reasons quickly became obvious. &quot;Throw down your weapons and surrender!&quot; They spoke English with a quaint accent.
&quot;May god be praised! We have rescued these women from the crowd, but we feared they would come back and over power us!&quot; Prospero responded.
&quot;Throw down your weapons! Give us the women!&quot; Several other soldiers were making ribald remarks about the girls.
&quot;Why?&quot;
&quot;We want to have fun with them! Throw down your weapons or we will shoot both of you!&quot;
&quot;Do you mean to rape all the women here?&quot;
The spokesman laughed. &quot;Of course! They are Chinese, that's all they are fit for! When we have finished with them we will turn them over to the crowd. Surrender them now or we'll kill you!&quot; Guns were aimed directly at Prospero.
He began reprimanding them. &quot;Do you call yourselves soldiers? You're not even fit to be called criminals! You are the lowest of the low! A disgrace to your uniform, your regiment, and your country! Your sacred duty is to protect citizens from harm!&quot; His voice took on the parade ground bark, and he started dressing them down in terms that might have made a drill sergeant blush.
Meanwhile, Nalini and I were concentrating on catching all their weapons. We were using our shadow shifting senses to fetch them to us instead of walking through shadow to them. That requires more power than we can normally muster, but our gems were supplying that We had to select all the weapons at once, so we took the trouble to double check: eleven rifles, two machine guns, three pistols and about a dozen knives. Together we reached out with our shadow shifting senses and fetched the weapons to us. The rush of energy made both of us groan, but the weapons in the soldiers' hands vanished leaving only a rainbow after image. Almost instantaneously they appeared at our feet.
The soldiers' mouths dropped open in shock. Nalini and I picked up the two machine guns. They were loaded, cocked and ready to fire. We casually pointed them at the soldiers.
&quot;Turn around and go home!&quot; Prospero barked. &quot;NOW!&quot;
&quot;How did you...?&quot; the spokesman began. There were background whispers about sorcery from several of the others.
&quot;I'll count to five. Then we shoot.&quot; His voice was cold. &quot;One... two... three...&quot; At this point the soldiers lost their nerve and fled, leaving the truck behind. Nalini and I fired a burst over their heads for good riddance. The crowd kept its distance, but several of them were hurling insults. It wouldn't take them long to decide to hurl rocks instead.
We intended to be out of that shadow within minutes. Nalini and I had a quick telepathic debate about what to do next, then she moved off to muster the rescued girls.
&quot;Prospero, you and I are going to ride back to Cromwell's shadow and fetch Imladril.&quot;
He nodded. &quot;Is it wise for both of us to go?&quot;
&quot;Well, it's safer to travel in pairs, as you know, but Nalini thinks it preferable that us menfolk disappear for a while.&quot;
&quot;Oh, of course! Let's go then.&quot;
We mounted our horses, but waited the extra minute until Nalini shifted everyone else out. I didn't set course for Cromwell's shadow, but rather for Imladril herself, in case she was elsewhere. I also tried to raise a mental link to Durathror, just in case we could short circuit the trip.
Prospero and I discussed the rescue as we rode. I was feeling a little civilized guilt about kneecapping, as was Nalini. Prospero had no such feelings. &quot;Danny, if we hadn't, all those girls would have been raped, possible killed, and the gods know what else they might have suffered. If this had been back home in Tarantia, we'd have had to send in several companies of soldiers with swords and spears, and a good number of rioters would have been killed or injured. As it was, all those at the front of the crowd were actively trying to rape the girls, so they're as guilty as hell any way!&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Kneecapping seems a suitable punishment.&quot;
&quot;Nalini suggests that castration might have been better.&quot;
&quot;Ugh!&quot; He shuddered. &quot;As a man, I can't condone castration. I'd prefer to kill rapists than castrate them. Kneecapping cripples them, but they are still intact, they can still lead fulfilling lives while being reminded of their crimes.&quot;
&quot;I suspect that some of them will die unless they get medical treatment.&quot;
&quot;That's their problem. If they want to riot, rape, loot and pillage, they have to expect injuries. I wish we could have done something more about the soldiers though.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, so do I. If I was a better sorcerer I'd have turned them into toads for a day.&quot;
&quot;One day, we will be able to do so. Soldiers are supposed to be trained to uphold the law, not side with rioters.&quot;
&quot;I must admit I was surprised at the dressing down you gave them, and even more surprised that they stood there and accepted it.&quot;
&quot;Well, don't forget I am a general in the Aquilonian army. I treated them the way I would have treated our own soldiers. There's a certain tone of command that you learn and soldiers all recognize. They knew I was a senior officer, they knew that what I said was true.&quot;
&quot;I wonder if we could have handled it better? Maybe used some sorcery at first.&quot;
He chuckled. &quot;I'd say we reacted the best way we knew. The two of us and Nalini are trained warriors, we're competent with physical violence. Paula and Liz have confidence, they don't go to pieces and they back us up. Sure it's dangerous, but we either avoid the situation or we become involved. If we become involved, we have to accept the risks.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, and one day we'll stage a rescue that will back fire and leave us injured or dead. I wish I knew some useful spells.&quot;
&quot;So do I, but that takes training. I'm new at sorcery, I can't do any spells at all. You can manage translation spells, money changing and a few small ones. When you first started martial arts training, could you have used it in a fight? You've been training for years to be proficient.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I guess you're right. Durathror makes it look so easy, but he's had over a thousand years of practice. And we both know that learning something well enough to perform it in front of your trainer is one thing, but using it in a knife edge situation like today is something else. Surviving a fight against a few trained opponents takes years of training and practice.&quot;
&quot;Speaking of which, you and Nalini worked extraordinarily well when you were attacked. Both of you seemed to dance around your opponents, and sometimes it looked as if you barely touched them, but still they dropped. Several of them even went flying into the crowd!&quot;
&quot;That surprised me a bit. Remember those katas Nalini and I have been practicing?&quot;
&quot;The ones you started teaching me, or the ones you are teaching Paula?&quot;
&quot;All of them actually. They don't just teach physical movement, they work on the energies as well. They are starting to come together for us.&quot;
&quot;Ah huh. I must confess I never quite believed you; I've been stalling because I already know how to fight. And I'm busy of course.&quot;
&quot;Put it off for too long and Paula will be able to beat you.&quot;
&quot;I'm having new respect for what you tell me!&quot; he grinned. &quot;I watched you hit someone in the chest, and the force of the blow threw him five or six meters into the crowd and so hard that a dozen people were knocked flying! I know I can't do that, and I know that normally you can't either.&quot;
&quot;What you missed was that I broke bones with every blow. I broke someone's shin with a block, that's a very hard bone to break. But I have seen a grand master give a demonstration of chi energy years ago. He could put six house bricks on top of each other, and break them all without touching them.&quot;
&quot;That's amazing! I'm sure you've told me this before, but what is chi energy?&quot;
&quot;Actually chi energy is a tautology. Chi is the Chinese word for energy. They divide it into eight classifications according to the eight directions. As near as I can ascertain, they were onto the same thing that Durathror describes.&quot;
&quot;Ah, now it makes sense. Durathror told me that energies have colors, and the different colors mean the energies have different uses. I can't see energies yet, but I can feel them, as you would know.&quot; We can't do things like shift through shadow unless we can channel enough energy. &quot;I associate energies with sorcery and shadow shifting, not martial arts.&quot;
I had to smile. &quot;Basic martial arts is assorted movements and techniques for self defense. You don't learn katas for that, you just need to practice the various techniques. You can become very proficient at those techniques, but without the energy you hit the wall very quickly. You are proficient enough that I can say you have to be using energies as well, although you don't know that. The katas are designed to promote the flow of energy or chi, and now that you can detect chi, I think you will notice that when you start performing katas again.&quot;
&quot;I believe I will. I should start tomorrow. But I find it amazing that you can use energy to break bricks, or injure opponents.&quot;
&quot;Hey, if Durathror threw someone across the room without touching them, you'd say he was using sorcery. I have seen masters of martial arts do just that. But whereas Durathror simply stands there and directs the energy, the martial arts master will use a movement like a strike to direct the energy. There's really no difference, all that matters is that you develop the energy flows, and that you know what you can do with them.&quot;
&quot;Knowing what to do is the difficult part, I'd say. If you give a sword to someone with no training, they generally have a vague idea which end to hold and think of hitting or stabbing, but they are not effective. They don't know what to do with it in life and death situations.&quot;
&quot;I find I can learn the uses, but it takes a life and death situation to push me to the point of using it instinctively. Imladril calls it internalizing the knowledge. Personally, I think when you reach a certain point, you can do a large number of spells, but what takes time is learning how to internalize each one to the point where all you have to do is think of the glyph and activate the energy.&quot;
&quot;That's another thing that puzzles me yet. What are these glyphs? They don't have power by themselves, do they?&quot;
&quot;Now we're getting into why we call it sorcery and not magic. There's stage magic, there's ceremonial magic and so on, but they all work from elaborate props and gestures. Like in ceremonial magic you draw circles on the floor, inscribe various runes or symbols, summon gods and demons to do your bidding, when really you are either using your energies to create thought forms, or calling up mischievous entities. None of the symbols or gestures has any power by itself. But it acts as a trigger to put the magician in the correct state of mind. We do not use props, instead we work with the energies directly. Sorcery is a better term because it doesn't carry the suggestions of ceremony.&quot; Prospero nodded.
I continued &quot;In ceremonial magic the symbol has to be correct, and there are great tables of correspondences to ensure that all the symbols, colors etc match. They try to tell you that if they don't all match the spell won't work. It's all nonsense, except that what the practitioner believes is what matters.&quot;
&quot;But it makes a convenient excuse for when the spells don't work. The sorcerers in Aquilonia are like that. Everything must be correct, from the pronunciation of names to hand gestures. If the spell didn't work, which is most of the time, then the magician had forgotten some minor detail. I never did have much respect for them.&quot;
&quot;I don't blame you. Humans are symbol users. We invented language, we are forever inventing new words to encompass new concepts. We manipulate symbols in our thinking. A symbol is a shorthand for the spell, it is a short hand for the action and effect. For example, if I said 'back fist punch', you'd know what I meant and you know how to do it because you have internalized the doing of it. If you were choreographing a fight scene in a movie you might have different symbols to indicate each of the blows. It's the same with spells: we internalize the doing of them, and attach that to a symbol. Durathror calls that symbol a glyph because it is something you can draw easily. It might be a simplified picture, it could be quite abstract.&quot;
&quot;So what sort of symbols do you use? I guess I'm curious because I haven't been taught yet.&quot;
I smiled &quot;Ah, patience is a virtue! Nalini and I tend to use the same symbols, mostly because we are telepathic. Nalini's symbol for the translation spell for example, is the Chinese character for speech. She's fluent in Chinese, she picked that character, and now she doesn't know why. It's possible that Korum used that symbol.
&quot;It isn't a good idea to use Chinese characters simply because they have ordinary meanings. Just think, every time she writes that character, she is going to think about the translation spell, but she has ever bothered changing it.
&quot;The money changing spell is the Egyptian hieroglyph for wealth: neither of us knows ancient Egyptian, so we never think of the symbol otherwise. A couple of spells use Norse runes, like the shield spell is the norse rune called the Helm of Protection, but that is the one Durathror uses. Some others use any of a dozen different archaic scripts. It just has to be distinctive, and easy to remember. Durathror even told me of a sorcerer he knew a few hundred years ago who used to draw a square on a piece of paper, divide that into smaller squares, like nine, sixteen or twenty five, and then write letters into some of the squares. He'd write the Latin word for what he wanted the spell to accomplish, and memorize that.&quot;
&quot;That's certainly different. And all you do is think of the symbol, and the spell happens?&quot;
&quot;Not quite, it's like thinking of moving your hand and moving your hand, or thinking of shifting into a shadow, and shifting into a shadow. You think of the symbol, then action it.&quot;
&quot;Do you know, that reminds me of once when I asked er... I think it was Fenodror, how he did sorcery. He just looked at me and said &quot;I think of what I want to accomplish, then I purse my lips and just blow gently.&quot; At first I thought he was joking with me, but I am coming to the realization that he was telling the truth. It's like you thinking of a glyph.&quot;
&quot;I haven't heard that one, but I'd say he is telling the truth. I mean, sorcery is all about intention, will and energy. I could say the same about martial arts. If you learn it well enough it become second nature like moving your arm. I am not consciously aware of how I move it, I just do it.&quot;
Prospero was nodding. &quot;There are so many new ideas, and it takes time for them to jell properly. Is there anything I can do to speed up the process of learning spells?&quot;
&quot;Not really. You have to learn in the order that Durathror sets, and improve your energy working. When he deems that good enough, you will begin to learn spells. But first you have to be good at shadow shifting.&quot;
&quot;Yes, I know all that. It implies I really must stop neglecting my katas.&quot;
We were riding along a winding rocky trail through sparse yellow vegetation. There were small bushes that resembled palm trees about a meter tall, taller spiky leafed grasses similar to pampas grass except that their feathery tops were vivid orange, and gnarled and twisted trees with reddish trunks and broad fleshy yellow leaves. The sky was littered with brown clouds like dog turds in a park. The sky was dirty blue, the sun small and green. The trail was blue black rocks like basalt and equally dark dirt. The land was reasonably flat. We had been riding for about forty minutes.
It seemed reasonably safe, so I paused in my shadow shifting and tried again to contact Durathror. This time it worked. There was a feeling of contact, and his words echoed in my mind.
&lt;&lt;Greetings Danny, this is unexpected. Is something wrong?&gt;&gt;
I held my hand up to let Prospero know I'd made contact. Then I swiftly appraised Durathror of the situation.
&lt;&lt;A moment please. I must inform Imladril.&gt;&gt;
There was silence for several minutes. Prospero and I walked our horses to the shade of some large yellow leafed trees and waited. The horses sniffed at the vegetation, but turned their noses up at it. Prospero's horse turned to look at him with an expression of reproach.
&quot;Easy star, we'll find some nice grass soon.&quot; He patted the horse's neck. &quot;It's fairly pleasant under these trees, though the breeze has some odd smells in it.&quot;
There were a number of unidentifiable odors best categorized as chemical. Add in a couple of tanneries, an oil refinery and rotting seaweed and you have an idea of the breeze.
&quot;Hmmm. Not my choice location for a holiday. You know, the variety we find in shadow never ceases to amaze me.&quot;
Prospero nodded. &quot;I wonder if we ever cross the same shadow during our travels? Every one seems different from all the others. I wish it was possible to find out a bit about them.&quot;
&quot;So do I. That's why Nalini and I are thinking of winding up our business. We don't need the money, but with the business we can't just go wandering into shadow, stopping where we like for a time.&quot; I chuckled deprecatingly. &quot;Then again, having a business to run probably stops us from wandering off to explore weirder and weirder shadows. It gives us a focus that anchors us to shadow Brisbane.&quot;
&quot;I don't have the urge to explore the weird ones.&quot; Prospero snorted. &quot;Don't close the business though, I find that helping you and Nalini run it is very interesting. It's all so completely different from anything I grew up with. We've barely mastered the printing press, and here I am learning about html and web pages and the java programming language.&quot; Suddenly he grinned. &quot;I come to work with all this and I'm like a little kid going &quot;Oh wow! This is so kewl!&quot; as Paula would say.
&quot;However, I do like the idea of settling in one shadow for a few months, exploring that, and then going home. Aquilonia and Brisbane are homes to which I can return. A man must have a home to which he can return after his adventures.&quot;
&quot;How can you say a cliche like that with a straight face?&quot; we both smiled. &quot;That's how we feel about the business, we enjoy doing it. We have homes in several different shadows now, but Brisbane is home for both of us. Neither of us was born there, oddly enough. Did you know, I was getting to the point of feeling I was stuck in a rut when I met Nalini? She really turned my life upside down.&quot;
&quot;I would say you two have done that to mine as well. Although I was scheduled to die when you rescued me: if you hadn't, that would have had an even bigger impact on my life!&quot; Not one to say the obvious, Prospero.
&quot;Funny about that. She and I did some travelling together, but our adventures seemed to start after we met you.&quot;
He smiled. &quot;And here I was thinking that before we met, you and Nalini went about banishing gods, destroying evil sorcerers, and generally saving the world on a weekly basis!&quot;
&quot;We had a few small adventures. I'm sure you've noticed that if you stay around so called human regions, from time to time you run into wars, bandits and raiders. We just try to help those we come across. Maybe it's an unconscious means of paying back for the gift of the torcs, and the ability to shadow shift. Rescuing you was our first big adventure. We've noticed that they seem to happen around you and Paula.&quot;
He grinned sheepishly. &quot;Two out of two doesn't make that a pattern. Anyway, we couldn't let those women be raped. One is scarcely more than a child!&quot;
&quot;Exactly. And so, like some comic book super heroes, we charge into the thick of things to stage a rescue. But unlike comic book heroes, we can be hurt and we can be killed.&quot;
Prospero chuckled. &quot;Your problem is you're too civilized! Now if Amrik were here, he'd have charged into the thick of things to stage a rescue, and not worried about being killed. He'd tell you he'd have an honor guard into the after life if he did.&quot;
&quot;Whereas you, Prospero, don't believe in the guard of honor theory any more. But Amrik is not as rash as you make out. Yes he'd stage a rescue, but he'd think things over first to be reasonably sure that he and his soldiers could get out alive.&quot;
Prospero raised both eyebrows, but nodded. &quot;I think you know him as well as I do. All his talk of glorious deaths and honor guards into the afterlife is to encourage the soldiers who may die in the battle. But they also know he would willingly risk his own life to save theirs, and that he won't risk a battle unless his soldiers have a chance coming back alive. That is one of many reasons why the soldiers will follow him anywhere.&quot;
&quot;Speaking of coming back alive, did you calculate we would win, or did you merely hope?&quot;
&quot;I confess I hoped. I trusted Nalini's intuition and yours. But in all honesty, could you have ridden on and left them to their fate?&quot;
I wondered. Could I have ridden on? By myself I could have and would have. One man could not do much. But could one sorcerer? I was still new to sorcery, still learning what was possible. Could I have ridden past with a clear conscience? &quot;Probably not. But I think we were trusting your ability as a general to assess the situation realistically. I guess our intuitions must have been right.&quot;
Prospero chuckled again, and shook his head. &quot;I may be a general, but I have limited knowledge of guns and modern weapons, and even more limited knowledge of what sorcery you two are capable. We were five against a mob. My assessment was that with a sudden strike, and fear, we could win long enough to get the women away. This we did.&quot;
&quot;Nalini and I have limited knowledge of what we are capable of. So far we have managed to pull off incredible things when it comes to the crunch, but I would rather not factor that in. We're still learning what we can do.&quot;
&quot;Did it occur to you that your power rounds up tests for you?&quot; Durathror's voice rang in the air. &quot;And that what ever the test, if you use your powers, you will pass it?&quot;
We looked around to see him standing behind us. &quot;Durathror, how long have you been standing there?&quot;
&quot;Not long, but I did catch the last of your conversation. Five against a mob, and you succeeded. That is what counts. Life is a series of tests. One day death will tap you on the shoulder, and there will be nothing you can do, but until then, if you use your powers, you will win. We are proud of you, even though it means work for Imladril and her healers.&quot;
&quot;Where is she?&quot;
&quot;She has summoned several healers, and together they have set off directly for Nalini. She should be there soon.&quot;
&quot;I will let Nalini know.&quot; I activated our private link, and told her what Durathror had said.
&lt;&lt;Thanks sweetheart. How long before you're back?&gt;&gt; she felt stressed.
&lt;&lt;We can probably be there soon if Durathror does the shifting. When do you want us back?&gt;&gt; I sent a mental hug.
She basked in the hug for a few seconds before she replied. &lt;&lt;Probably best to wait until after Imladril has arrived. Oh, she's here already. Head back soon hey? Gotta go!&gt;&gt; she blew me a kiss.
I let Durathror and Prospero know the situation.
&quot;Very well, we shall take a slightly scenic route.&quot; Durathror responded. He looked up at the two of us seated on our horses. &quot;Hmmm, I think I should have brought a horse. Never mind, the walk will be good for me. Prospero, you will lead off. You can practice your shifting for ten or fifteen minutes.&quot;
&quot;All right. Er... I should focus on Nalini and Paula should I not?&quot;
&quot;If you remember the details of the shadow in which you left them, you could head there, but they may have moved. Focusing on a person is a better choice in these circumstances.&quot;
Prospero wheeled his horse and lead us back along the trail, taking about fifty seconds to select his next shadow. He moved in shorter hops than Nalini and I could, but then he was learning, and we were marking time for a little while.
The trail switched to dark red soil, the leafy shrubs and trees became smoky blue green. The sky was gray. We rode down past a wash away toward a creek. We shifted before we reached the stream.
Now the trail was more clearly defined, and the stream passed underneath a stone bridge. We rode over the bridge, the hooves of our horses ringing loudly.
Smokey blue gave was to deep red of crusted blood. The trees were covered in short spiky leaves. On a branch a large bird the color of fresh blood watched us. It let out a single &quot;Kwark!&quot;
&quot;And to you also.&quot; Durathror responded before the scene changed in a ripple of rainbows. The foliage was darker, almost brown, the leaves broader. On a low overhanging branch a single blood red bird sat, watching us.
&quot;What did the bird say? Has it been sucked after us?&quot;
&quot;It wished us good hunting. Danny, you should be able to tell me whether the bird has been sucked after us.&quot;
I checked the other shadow myself. &quot;The branch is empty. Did it fly away, or is that the same?&quot;
Durathror smiled in a secretive manor. &quot;You should ask it yourself. You have not asked me how I knew what it said.&quot;
The scenery rippled again, and this time there was no tree nearby. Around us stretched boulders as far as the eye could see, round ones like some god's lost marbles. The sky was polished copper, the sun an eyesearing bloodshot eye. The blood red raven appeared on one of the nearby boulders, fading in accompanied by rainbows. It most definitely had not been sucked after us, but had shifted in by itself.
Prospero reigned in his horse. &quot;Durathror, we assume you can listen in on the thoughts of animals. You spoke aloud to alert us that the raven is intelligent. We have legends back home in Aquilonia about ravens. This one is obviously interested in us, and has been dragged after us.&quot;
Durathror nodded, twirled his moustache. &quot;There is truth in what you say Prospero. Danny, what do you say?&quot;
I had been using my shadow shifting ability to see the raven with senses other than sight. Its aura was strange, and there were lines and whorls of power about it. &quot;I am tempted to say it is a magical being. It traveled here of its own accord. Its aura is not that of a bird, nor of anything I have seen before.&quot;
&quot;Very good!&quot; Durathror nodded. &quot;Allow you to present my mentor.&quot;
With this the raven stood and leaped to the ground. As it descended, there was a twisting sensation in the back of my brain. The bird's head seemed to stay at a particular height, while the body enlarged and changed until the feet connected with the ground. A lithe male stood before us. His skin was coppery red, he wore a simple loin cloth that consisted of two flaps of red leather, one front, the other back. His hair was long and straight, the color of fresh blood, and hung to his shoulders. Around each calf a thong of red leather had been tied, with seven red feathers attached. Similar thongs were tied to his wrists. A complicated device hung on his chest: a hoop with netting spread over it, red feathers and colored stones tied here and there. His arms were spread like the wings of a bird, and in his left hand he held a small drum made from the skull of an animal over which red skin had been stretched taughtly, while in his right he held a small bleached bone into which red markings had been incised.
He waggled his left hand and the drum made a noise like a rattle snake, then he brought both arms together in a sweeping movement to play a rapid timpany on the drum with the bone. He stopped suddenly and stared at Prospero and me, his eyes the piercing stare of a raven.
My mind did a double take. Intellectually I knew that Durathror must have learned his sorcery from someone, but I had assumed it was another of the Viharani, much older, and perhaps dead now. This youthful looking man must be older than Durathror, and as his mentor, must have considerably more power.
Prospero was in the process of dismounting, I followed suit. &quot;Humph, a fine looking pair.&quot; Durathror's mentor commented. It took only a moment to realize he was using a translation spell. &quot;The humans show promise too!&quot; he continued. We didn't laugh, but we were smiling when we walked around our horses' heads to confront the red skinned man. &quot;See! I am not so terrible after all.&quot; Even his speach seemed quick and bird like.
Prospero and I gave a half bow. &quot;Greetings honored sir.&quot; Prospero announced. &quot;Your company is an unexpected pleasure.&quot;
&quot;Hah! Idle phrases. You know me not. But I greet you both in turn.&quot;
Durathror stepped into the conversation. &quot;I am sure this is not a visit for idle gossip. We were on our way to meet up with my sister Imladril, as you know.&quot;
&quot;I know, though you will take days at the rate your apprentice is shifting. I wished to see your fledglings for myself.&quot; He turned back to us. &quot;I am the Raven. Who are you?&quot;
We introduced ourselves.
&quot;Wrong! Your names have no meaning. Not fit names for sorcerers!&quot; He looked at me with a penetrating stare. &quot; I see the Eagle has put his mark upon you. You are Soaring Eagle. And you&quot; he turned to Prospero &quot;are the Wolf that hunts with the bull. Much better!&quot;
He turned back to Durathror, and they talked soundlessly.
&quot;That's uncanny, Danny. Did you know, back when Amrik and I were in the revolution, his nickname was &quot;the Bull&quot; and mine was &quot;the Wolf&quot;?&quot;
&quot;I think I did. If this is Durathror's mentor, then it means he can do things that Durathror cannot. He's obviously able to pick up on things like that.&quot;
&quot;And perhaps your compatriots called you Wolf because they could detect your innate self.&quot; the Raven interrupted. &quot;It is time we were moving.&quot;
Durathror nodded. &quot;Prospero, I want you to perform five shifts toward our destination. Then Danny will take over and perform eight. Don't bother mounting.&quot;
Prospero's first shift took us to a sulfurous smelling shadow strewn with weathered sky blue boulders. The ground was leprous green like the color of verdigrised copper. A scorching blue sun beat down upon us from an emerald sky. In the boulders' shade were barrel shaped things like armored cactuses. I wondered how high the ultra violet was here. Definitely not my choice of shadow. But I knew that Prospero was taking an almost direct line toward Nalini. In time he would learn to deviate for more pleasant shadows.
His next shift gained us respite from the heat. We walked across a desert of dull yellow gravel, a red sun slanting behind distant hills. The sky was dirty pink, and brown clouds scudded under the influence of a cool wind. The wind gusts had teeth, promising a cold night.
With the third we shifted into sparsely covered scrub land. Waist high bushes with smoky gray leaves grew in rings anywhere between five meters and fifty meters across. The sky was partially overcast, obscuring the sun. Distant hills looked blue. The breeze was cool and refreshing.
With the fourth we found ourselves walking along a cliff top above a raging ocean. The waves thundered and crashed against the cliff, shaking the ground beneath our feet. The rocky ground was covered with clumps of low plants with fat fleshy leaves like fingers, and delicate sky blue flowers that seemed to be made of many many threads. The ocean breeze was chill, and soaring seabirds cried over our heads. Away from the sea, gnarled trees grew, twisted and slanted away from the prevailing wind. Further in the distance the scrub and bushes grew, and the land sloped gently up toward a distant volcano, its flanks decorated with snow. The world felt deserted, untouched by humans.
His final shift brought us into a small clearing beside a burbling stream. Pink crystalline trees grew about like large corals. From their tops sprouted silver threads that tinkled like wind chimes in the breeze. The vegetation underfoot was almost entirely stony mushrooms and oddly shaped growths.
We stopped, and the Raven asked &quot;Prowling Wolf, where would you shift next? And why?&quot;
We stopped, and the Raven asked &quot;Prowling Wolf, where would you shift next? And why?&quot;
&quot;I'm not very experienced. I can only detect about seven shadows.&quot; I could detect considerably more. &quot;Two feel quite strange, I wouldn't consider them&quot; there were more than two strange ones, but I knew the two he was discussing. One seemed to have rocks that floated in the air. There was more, but it felt wrong, dangerous. The second had an atmosphere that seemed to be almost as thick as water, and crushing gravity. &quot;One is a plane but it doesn't feel inviting, one has snow, and one is extremely hot.&quot; The plane was some sort of metal, with regular shapes dotted about. They felt like artifacts. I sometimes wondered if these odd ones weren't shadows of giants, and the plane a bench or desk top, or even a kitchen sink. The one with snow was blowing a blizzard. The other one seemed to have furnace like heat, and the rocks themselves seemed to be flowing; possibly a recent volcanic eruption. &quot;There is a rocky promontory that projects out into the sea. I think there is a light house at the end. It feels cold, but safe. There is one that seems to be jungle of some sort, it feels okay, but I think I would avoid it. The other one is similar to this one. It's the most direct shadow I'd pick that one.&quot;
That made eight, but we all knew, could see in fact, that the shadows weren't just tangled like noodles, they writhed around each other like a bowl of worms. Some would drift out of focus while we discussed them and others would drift into focus.
&quot;Very good!&quot; The Raven commented. &quot;You have the sense of direction, you can sense many of the dangers. You still need much practice, and you must build up your powers. Soaring Eagle, where would you shift?&quot;
I had been sifting and considering as Prospero spoke. &quot;I can detect quite a few, but most of them I would discard. This shadow has echoes that curl so&quot; I gestured with my hand &quot;The cape with the light house is promising, but it also curls away. The jungle has large carnivores prowling around, it might be safe to pass through, but not to follow&quot; I was speaking of the trends in the shadows. Rather than follow the direct route as Prospero was doing, I preferred to take small detours to avoid sudden changes of terrain. It was an ability that came as one's powers grew; at first I had done just as Prospero had done. &quot;The cape is my second choice, this shadow's trail my third. The most promising is the logging track through the forest that is moving within range. It has many echoes that seem to head in the right direction.&quot;
&quot;Very good! You seek to minimize the sudden changes. Lead on.&quot;
Sudden changes are tiring for us, and can frighten the horses. It is a lot easier to cope with gradual changes, even if it means a little more shifting. It is often said that you can find anything in shadow, as long as you can visualize it. I wanted an easy walking trail to our destination.
I started walking forward, focused on the shadow I had selected, and felt the familiar &quot;long itching&quot; feeling in my solar plexus as something fastened onto the shadow and drew us there. A rainbow swirl spread out over the rocks, fading from the center outwards to reveal a reddish dirt logging track, rutted by tires of heavy vehicles. We were surrounded by leafy trees in autumnal splendor.
I followed the trail for a further four shifts, while autumn shaded toward winter, and the track widened. Then I shifted toward a different trail, where the trees were leafier, possibly late spring. The trail widened over three more shifts while the trees thinned. There was a storm ahead in many shadows, so I detoured around it. The climate warmed, the sky shaded into yellow, while the vegetation grew tall. Grasses and flowers disappeared, to be replaced my many fern like and palm like plants.
&quot;This is enough!&quot; The Raven stopped me. &quot;Where would you go from here?&quot;
&quot;I wouldn't follow this set for long, I believe there are dinosaurs around. I am heading toward the tropical shadows after we have detoured around the storm. Although I can sense them, I cannot shift that far in one shift. Other than that, night is falling in many, and I would like to avoid travelling by night. We'll be coming into inhabited shadows in perhaps five or six shifts, I haven't yet made up my mind about them.&quot;
&quot;Hah! You have done well. Now you will observe what I do. We seek Durathror's sister. For me that is a short step, but to shift in one step would require a sudden change of scenery. I prefer to make several gradual changes when we travel with animals. So, I select four shadows between here and there. They are my guide posts. I will not jump between them, but rather shift gradually between them. You take almost a minute to select a shadow and shift, I take less than a second. I will add and subtract features with each shift until I reach our destination. Let us walk!&quot;
I am used to the strange sights of shifting through shadow, but when The Raven shifted it was almost as if we were watching a film in fast forward. The vegetation shrank while the leaves widened. The sky shaded from yellow through green to pink. The trail widened with each step, but the changes with each sift were subtle. The land grew hilly, and we found ourselves walking up hill through thickening trees. Then the trees shrank toward bushes while our track became the spur of a flat topped hill.
I knew what he was doing, which was almost the exact opposite of what Nalini, Prospero, Paula and I did. While we all focused on our destination in order to select shadows, we moved in discrete steps toward that destination. Prospero had spoken of detecting only seven shadows; in fact there were an infinite number, and he would be able to detect a very large number of them. The adjacent shadows are similar to the current one, but represent only a small step. All of us have an idea in mind when we sift through the adjacent shadows, and that somehow filters what we perceive. We all sought to make discrete steps toward our destination, so we detected shadows that represented that. If it takes us a minute or two for each shift, why shift the equivalent of a baby step when we can take a full step? The effect of taking large steps is that each shadow can be quite different from those that preceeded it. Nalini and I tried to minimize that effect by not following the most direct line toward our destination, but detouring through similar shadows for a smoother transition. It meant more steps, but then we could sift further and faster than Paula and Prospero could.
The Raven on the other hand was able to shift much faster again, and so contented himself to take shorter steps very rapidly. The result was almost a continuum of small changes that added up to the same effect of our larger but slower shifts.
We walked from the scrub toward a cleared area that flickered suddenly into what looked like long lost ruins. There were fallen fluted columns, broken stone walls, and shattered statues. Underfoot were paving stones, weeds growing between the cracks. The sky was pale pink, the weather pleasantly warm. Ahead was a weathered stepped pyramid, flanked by statues of reclining figures. In front of the pyramid was a group of people, among whom I recognized Imladril and Nalini. Off to our left three horses were tied.
The Raven spread his arms expansively. &quot;So! When you are good, you will be able to do that too.&quot; He turned and walked toward the group, accompanied by Durathror. Prospero and I tied up our horses and followed.
Nalini ran to greet me, threw her arms around me. &quot;Am I glad to see you. I need a hug!&quot; She was trembling.
I hugged her tight, held her. &quot;It's been rough, hasn't it?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. There were all these hysterical girls. Liz and I had a little cry with them. I was glad when Imladril arrived.&quot;
I shushed her words with a kiss, but since we're both telepathic I could feel her own distress at what she had witnessed, and the echoes of her own experience so long ago. Gradually her trembling subsided. It was then that we became aware of Liz standing near by, trying not to look at us. &quot;She's upset too.&quot;
I kissed the top of her head, then her lips. &lt;&lt;Okay sweetheart.&gt;&gt; &quot;Liz, come here&quot; I motioned, speaking gently.
She screwed up her face, but came over to us. &quot;I guess I feel a bit left out...&quot; she began.
Nalini and I both extended an arm, folded her against us in a hug. &quot;You don't have to explain. Everyone needs a hug sometimes, and you've been through a rough spot...&quot; At that point she buried her head against my chest, her body wracked with sobs. I stood there wordlessly, patting her back, Nalini made soothing noises like you make to a child.
The sobs subsided, then she blew her nose. &quot;Sorry, it's been a bit trying&quot;
&quot;And it brought back unpleasant memories&quot; Nalini concluded for her. &quot;Liz, don't be ashamed. It happened to you, it happened to me. It's a terrible experience, but I can say I know what it's like. We heal, we put it behind us, and we go on.&quot; She gave Liz a squeeze.
&quot;Thanks. That's the first time it's bothered me for ages. All those crying girls upset me too. But I'm over it now, I'm strong!&quot;
&quot;Yes you are Liz, you're stronger than Paula I think. She hasn't had your experiences. I'd say you're cooler under fire too.&quot; Liz nodded.
&quot;Shall we go over to Imladril?&quot; Nalini asked. &quot;Liz, if the past does start bothering you, ask Imladril to give you a healing. She did that for me, she will be doing it with those girls soon.&quot;
Liz made a face, then nodded. &quot;Maybe I should. I could just join with the others, couldn't I?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
Nalini released Liz, and we started walking over to the group. Nalini had her arm around my waist, mine was around hers. My other arm had been around Liz's shoulders, she caught it as I moved it away, and slid her arm around my waist. &lt;&lt;Put your other arm around her Danny, she needs some support.&gt;&gt; Nalini thought to me. And so, arms around each others waists, we walked over to the group.
&quot;Were you two scared when you started the attack?&quot;
&quot;It made me so angry to see what they were doing to those poor girls!&quot; Nalini exclaimed. &quot;We just had to do something.&quot;
&quot;If I'd thought about it in those terms, I might have been. I was too busy making sure it all worked out.&quot; I responded. &quot;Mind you, I did wonder whether the 'oh shit!' factor would kick in.&quot;
&quot;What's that?&quot;
&quot;That's when you reach the point of no return in some action, and then you realize &quot;Oh shit! I didn't want to do that!&quot; And of course it's too late when you realize that. But Prospero will tell you that action cures fear.&quot;
&quot;Mmm, I think he's right. I was scared at first, but once it all started happening, I didn't have time to be afraid.&quot;
&quot;You're very brave Liz...&quot; I began.
&quot;You poor thing, Liz!&quot; Nalini sympathized. &quot;We should take better care of you. I should have thought - it's all right for Danny and I to risk our own lives, but we should look after you and not risk yours.&quot;
&quot;It's okay Nalini. You're right, we had to do something. We couldn't just ride on past and let them be raped and murdered! Danny, who's the red man?&quot;
&quot;I was wondering about him myself&quot; Nalini added.
&quot;Uh... he's Durathror's mentor. He calls himself The Raven. When we met him, he was a blood red raven. I can't tell you much else, other than he's very good at shadow shifting.&quot;
&quot;If he's Durathror's mentor, he must be very good. I'd guess he must be from one of the primary shadows.&quot;
&quot;He looks so... tribal!&quot; Liz commented.
&quot;Yes, I'd take him for a shaman.&quot;
At this point we reached the group. The girls were fully clothed, and milling around. Many had sorrowful faces, some talked with one another.Ra'anor and three healers I did not know walked amongst the girls, touching one, talking to another.
Imladril greeted us with hugs. &quot;We are proud of you. But you must take care. I have heard that there were large numbers of men in the mob.&quot;
&quot;Uh, yeah. If we'd thought about the odds we may not have rescued the girls. Instead, intuition, coupled with suprise and a bit of sorcery pulled it off.&quot;
&quot;We weren't sure what sorcery we could muster though.&quot;
&quot;No, you do not yet know enough. That will develop over the years.&quot;
&quot;How are the girls?&quot;
&quot;Oh, physically they are fine now. You rescued them before any serious damage was done. Mentally they need the healing we are about to begin.&quot;
&quot;Then we should leave you in peace for a while.&quot;
&quot;Yes, would be good. Why not go and talk with Durathror for a while. We shouldn't be more than about twenty or thirty minutes.&quot;
&quot;Um... can I join the girls?&quot; Liz asked hesitantly.
Imladril studied her for several heart beats. &quot;Of course you can dear.&quot; She said tenderly. &quot;You will benefit.&quot; She turned, shepherding Liz towards the group of girls. Nalini and I joined Prospero, Paula, Durathror and the Raven.
I performed the introductions, Nalini murmured something polite to the Raven. He stared at Nalini for a few moments before replying. &quot;Humph! Your parents may have thought you were a forest flower, but you are not. The Eagle has set his mark on you. You are Stalking Jaguar.&quot;
She nodded. &quot;I believe I have used that in my dreams.&quot;
&quot;That is because in the dreaming it is easier to recall who you are, and what you are.&quot;
He turned to all of us. &quot;I hope all this praise over your rescue hasn't swollen your heads. One day, if you live long enough, you might make half way decent sorcerers. If that happens, then you will also encounter myself or my companions, and we will become mentors to you.&quot;
&quot;Who or what are you exactly?&quot; Nalini asked. &quot;We know you must be powerful if you are Durathror's mentor.&quot;
&quot;I choose not to answer that question now. Let me just say that I could teach your friend Korum a few things, if he decided to learn. Now, you have rescued the girls, have you thought how you planned to return them to their homes?&quot;
&quot;We know there are problems. We can't just leave them where we found them, they'd be raped again. Somehow we have to return them to their homes.&quot;
&quot;It's worse than that Danny. I talked with a few of them. There's been rioting for a day or two. There is a great deal of ethnic tension because the girls are Chinese, the rioters are not. The Chinese are the merchants in their shadow, it's a bit like ours I guess, and the locals resent the fact that the Chinese have more money. There's been looting and pillaging, one girl was taken from her parents' shop by looters who were smashing the place. They tell stories of girls being gang raped by hundreds of rioters, some are killed, some are savagely beaten and left for dead. Hundreds of Chinese tried to flee to the airport, but most were stopped, dragged from their cars and robbed and beaten or worse.&quot; She looked distressed. &quot;I don't know what to do really. I was hoping Durathror and Imladril could help.&quot;
Prospero clicked his tongue in disapproval. Paula shook her head. &quot;It's disgusting the way they behaved.&quot;
The Raven's eyes glittered, his face hard. &quot;Durathror, what do you think?&quot;
Durathror stroked his moustache. &quot;I haven't had a chance to appraise the situation myself, but from what Nalini says it will be very difficult to return any of them until the trouble abates.&quot; He looked at Nalini and myself. &quot;I may be a sorcerer, I may be able to use my powers to do horrible things to the rioters, but once I turn my concentration away, things revert to what they were. As you found out earlier, it is very difficult to change even one person's outlook on life. We managed with Cromwell and Charles and a few of the Puritans, but that took weeks of intense efforts. Here we have a civil uprising. I really don't know what to do, other than take the girls somewhere else for a time, and then return them.&quot;
&quot;And if you do that, their families will worry themselves sick.&quot; Nalini added.
&quot;Precisely!&quot; The Raven responded.
==&gt;
&quot;But we can't just drop them back into the violence.&quot; I protested.
&quot;Others might argue otherwise, but the workings of power decreed that you should interfere, that you have done. Now we must continue from where we are, rather than where we wish we were. I see nothing wrong with taking the girls with us.&quot;
&quot;The girls may disagree with you.&quot; Nalini put in mildly. She opened her mouth to say more, but the Raven stopped her.
&quot;I am well aware of these considerations. I am asking you Stalking Jaguar, Soaring Eagle, and Prowling Wolf to think about it. You cannot become involved as you have done and then expect someone else to remove your meat from the fire because it is burning!&quot;
&quot;So we take the girls with us. Maybe we could inform their relatives.&quot; I commented. &quot;But their relatives are in danger as well. So we take them as well, and in the end we try to rescue tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese because the locals are racially intolerant. We lack the resources to do all this.&quot; I think I sounded peevish.
Durathror smiled ruefully. &quot;I also lack the power to rescue tens of thousands. I can quell a riot, but I cannot prevent another one from happening tomorrow or the next day. I requested my mentor meet me to see if he could suggest something. Is there anything you can suggest, Raven?&quot;
The Raven snorted. &quot;I would suggest that you take the girls to safety, and return them in a few weeks when the trouble settles down. But I am not oblivious to the heartache that will cause their relatives. I am also quite aware that unless something is done, the riots could continue for days or even weeks, resulting in the deaths of thousands, and the injury of many thousands more.&quot;
He seemed to be waiting for something. Durathror sighed &quot;Taking the girls to safety with us is simple. But will any of them have families to go home to in a few weeks? Raven, I did not ask you to meet me so you could tell me what is obvious to me. Is there something you can do that I cannot? The mere fact of your presence suggests that there are possibilities open to you.&quot;
&quot;I came to meet your students! I did not come to pull their roasting meat from the fire for them!&quot;
Nalini and I felt there was little point in continuing this conversation. I thought to ask Durathror whether we could take the girls back to their shadow. I asked Nalini whether we should take them with us to Aquilonia, or to Brisbane.
&lt;&lt;Well we have more room in Aquilonia...&gt;&gt; she began.
Prospero was of a like mind with us, or perhaps he had picked up on our feelings. &quot;Well, sir Raven, since there is nothing you can do to assist, we will take the girls to my estates in Poitain. At least they will be safe there. Danny, Nalini, we will need to procure suitable walking clothes and footwear, it will be a long journey.&quot;
The Raven laughed. &quot;Ho! You think to call my bluff, Prowling Wolf? See, you have come up with a solution that is within your powers.&quot; His voice and mouth laughed, but there seemed to be no mirth in his eyes. &quot;You must learn that if you roast your meat on a stick, and it falls into the fire, then it is you who must pull it from the fire! However, I did not say I would not help, only that none of you should expect my help.&quot;
Prospero demurred. &quot;I do not seek to call your bluff sir Raven, only if you will not help, then we must start our own preparations to move the girls.&quot;
&quot;Good! But since I am here, I shall help as best I can!&quot; He swept us with his gaze, imperious, haughty, piercing. &quot;But first, do any of you notice anything about this place?&quot;
&quot;There are ruins...&quot; Prospero began.
&quot;Too obvious!&quot;
Nalini and I looked at one another. &quot;There are lines of force emanating from the pyramid and the statues...&quot;
&quot;Ah hah! What else do you notice?&quot;
&quot;The flag stones are invigorating...&quot;
&quot;...while the pyramid is brooding...&quot;
&quot;...it seems to have much power...&quot;
&quot;...but its power is sleeping...&quot;
&quot;...there is no awareness there...&quot;
&quot;...the statues on the other hand...&quot;
&quot;...are full of danger...&quot;
&quot;...almost as if...&quot;
&quot;...they seek to hunt us...&quot;
&quot;...they are sentient...&quot;
&quot;...and they are aware of us...&quot;
We were deliberately playing ping pong with the words, something we tend to do when we are thinking together. It often disconcerts others, which is why we do it.
&quot;The statues are aware of us!&quot; The Raven smiled. &quot;I instructed Imladril to convey the girls here. You should know that this is a place of power! Long ago sorcerers lived here, and this is where they raised their powers!&quot; His arm swept around the vista. &quot;These statues are terrible demons, sleeping now, until something awakens them. The very flagstones beneath out feet ooze power! Feel it!&quot;
From the corners of my eyes, half seen scintillations alerted me to the presence of small spirits. I let my shadow shifting senses come fully alert, and I could sense lines and whorls of power, through which the spirits cavorted. The stepped pyramid pulsed with power, but that power was without will. The statues of reclining figures on the other hand were pregnant with ill will, making them a stain in the environment.
&quot;Once, powerful sorcerers came here, and challenged magical beings. The sorcerers desired to live forever, not accepting that physical bodies decay, and the spirit is reborn. They sought physical immortality. They went to great lengths to achieve physical immortality. This is their place of power, the results of all their workings. To achieve their ends, they changed their bodies into something enduring, something that will last for thousands upon thousands of years.&quot;
I knew where he was leading. &quot;These statues are what is left of those sorcerers, aren't they?&quot;
&quot;These statues are those old sorcerers! They still live as immortal stone. They are all around us, they sense us, they would feed on our power if they could. But they abandoned the human band, they adopted the band of the earth, and this is the result.&quot;
&quot;They aren't dead then?&quot; Prospero asked.
&quot;No, they are not dead. They have become stone statues. Their awareness is that of stone, slowed many hundreds of times from our own awareness. They sought physical immortality, and they went to any lengths to achieve that. They followed a path without a heart, and they lost their humanity!&quot;
&quot;Are they dangerous?&quot;
&quot;To those girls you rescued, yes! They can suck out the girls' power, and leave them dried out husks. But not in the presence of powerful sorcerers. They envy us because they know that we have achieved what they sought, without paying the price they paid. They also know that their power is there for the taking by any with the ability. They especially resent sorcerers, but there is little they can do.&quot;
He raised both hands, and the lines and whorls running through that place swarmed around his hands like iron filings to a magnet. As I watched him manipulate them, I realized that he was doing something that had its basis in what Nalini and I could do with the power links in our gems. They made power available to us, the Raven was using the powers of this place for his own use.
&quot;Now, I must protect all of you. Like so!&quot;
He created a shielding spell for each of us, similar to the one that Durathror had sometimes used. There was a feeling of a slight tightening of the skin, a slight prickling sensation, and no more. The shield was like an invisible suit of armor, impervious to bullets, explosions, poison gas, and much more. One day we would be able to create such a shield for ourselves.
&quot;Let us inspect the shadow.&quot; He gestured for the rest of us to join him. The shadows blurred, and we walked out into the same park from which we had rescued the girls an hour or so ago. There was pandemonium all about.
Nearby, wounded men were being loaded onto hand carts and the back of a battered old truck. Soldiers stood guard, firing guns into the crowds from time to time. The crowd itself was rampaging though the park and the surrounding streets, throwing rocks, bottles, pieces of paving, anything they could get their hands on. Many of the buildings were on fire, those that weren't were in the process of being looted. The trees in the park had been trashed, the ornamental iron fencing had been turned into weapons. Even as we watched, the crowd pulled the stout iron barred shutters from a nearby building, and swarmed over each other in their eagerness to get at those sheltering inside. Helpless men, women and children were being dragged out. I felt a surge of anger, an urge to burn all the looters to ash.
&quot;No&quot; the Raven said quietly &quot;let me.&quot; The next moment, all the victims vanished. A moment later, they appeared in a group around us. There were thirty or forty people, at least half of them children. There was fear in their eyes, many of the women and children were crying, and their clothing was in disarray. Several were injured, mostly children. One, a child of about two or three, was screaming with the pain of broken bones.
The Raven reached out his right hand to the child, and its screams quieted. He made soothing noises such as a father will make to small children, and turned to touch all of those he had rescued. Their injuries vanished, their torn clothes repaired themselves.
&quot;You are safe now!&quot; the Raven announced to them. They huddled around him, trying to take comfort from their miraculous rescue. I caught sight of the Raven's eyes for a moment, tears glistened there. &quot;They should not have hurt the children.&quot; An arctic blizzard would have been warmer than the Raven's voice. His jaw was set. &quot;Now the punishment begins!&quot;
We were a little distant from the action, but what seemed to happen was this:
The iron railings writhed and became poisonous snakes with metal skins. They could not be killed or injured, but they turned on the crowds and bit them. The flames leaping from the buildings took on a life of their own, and leaped amongst the crowds, charring flesh. The billowing clouds of smoke became swarms of angry hornets that descended on the rioters and stung and stung and stung. The rioters trampled one another in their panic to get away.
Where we stood was an island of comparative calm. The surging crowd parted at some unseen barrier and went around us. The soldiers were swept away, along with the hand carts.
&quot;Many will die today.&quot; Durathror observed. &quot;Could you not have put them to sleep?&quot;
&quot;I could, but they would not learn, they would do the same tomorrow. Those who die today are those who are guilty of rape or murder. Those who are injured will be those who injured others. Such is the sorcery I have wrought.&quot;
&quot;But what of those who are trampled underfoot?&quot;
&quot;Casualties of war. They should not be out in the riots in the first place. None here are innocent.&quot;
&quot;Should we move away from here for the time being?&quot; Durathror asked.
&quot;Yes, let us go!&quot; The Raven conveyed all of us back to where Imladril was. There were looks of astonishment on the faces of those we'd rescued. &quot;You are dreaming!&quot; the Raven assured them. &quot;Soon you will wake and find this has been nothing but a bad dream!&quot;
&quot;Raven, what did you mean when you said they should not have hurt the children?&quot; Nalini asked.
&quot;I was debating with myself whether to kill or to injure. The child's broken bones decided it for me.&quot;
&quot;That affected you more than you're letting on, didn't it?&quot;
The Raven perched his rump on the base of one of the statues. He surveyed all of us, including those he had rescued. &quot;I am an old sorcerer, old enough that even Durathror is as young to me as you are to him.&quot; I did a quick calculation: Durathror was perhaps forty times my age. If the Raven was forty times Durathror's age, it made him somewhere around fifty thousand years old. I was staggered. &quot;These statues were contemporaries of mine, but they followed a broken path. They lost their hearts, and their humanity. I walked a different path, I chose to use my powers to help those less fortunate than myself. Many people however, must live many lives before they can benefit from my help. The suffering of others affects me deeply, especially when it is inflicted by humans who behave worse than animals.&quot; He fell silent, staring off into the distance.
&quot;You must have seen a lot of suffering in your life...&quot; Nalini began.
He looked at her, one of those penetrating gazes. &quot;No more than many others. You have suffered much in your life.&quot; He breathed deeply, let it out slowly. &quot;You young ones with your technology are able to see the suffering of others around your world. Societies without such know very little about the suffering they inflict on others. Most people only know personal suffering, and have little compassion for others.&quot;
He breathed in, making a hissing sound with his teeth. &quot;When I was a child, a raiding party came to our village. They killed many of our warriors, they mutilated and left for dead the old, the sick and the ugly, they ripped babies from the wombs of their mothers, they raped all the women and many of the children. Those they did not kill they took away to sacrifice to their bloodthirsty gods. I came to realize that those who had been mutilated and killed in the village were the lucky ones. Those they sacrificed they first broke every bone in their bodies, then they flayed them alive. Their shaman would don the bloody skin and dance around while the victim died.&quot; His eyes were like glittering marbles, his jaw a grim line.
&quot;How did you escape?&quot;
&quot;We were held in a palisade, guarded by warriors armed with clubs. Should anyone try to escape he would be beaten senseless. When he awoke, he would find himself tied to the altar awaiting sacrifice. So as you can see, there was no easy way to escape. I had already been apprenticed to our village shaman, and knew something of sorcery. For three nights, I sought out my totem animal, the bear, in order to beseech it to rescue me. For three days I watched as my relatives were taken one by one from our prison, and sacrificed. They were mostly women and children, and they screamed horribly for hours before they died.&quot; His jaw clenched.
&quot;I swore bloody vengeance, I cursed their bloodthirsty gods, I screamed at our gods to save me, but nothing happened. For three nights I sought futilely for my totem. For three days I watched as my mother and my brothers and sisters died horribly. Finally I could take no more. I cursed my gods and my totem for allowing such suffering into the world, I reviled all gods as cruel abominations, and I bargained with what ever spirits could hear me that if they would spare the others, I would let the shaman sacrifice me. My body fell down, and I went completely into the spirit world. A magical being in the form of a blood red raven visited me, and told me that since I had truly offered myself in place of the others, it would help me. It also offered to become my totem, and to teach me sorcery. In return, it asked me to promise that I would use my sorcery to protect the children and the innocent, and destroy those who prey upon them.
&quot;When I awoke, I found that a pack of nahwatl - they are ferocious hunters about the size of elephants, with teeth like daggers and hide so tough you cannot cut it with a knife. The pack had come into the village, and eaten everyone who was outside our stockade. Two warriors had tried to save themselves by climbing into our prison, but those of us who remained beat them to death. We waited until the nahwatl left, then we escaped our prison, took what we needed from the vacant village, and returned to our village.&quot;
He smiled suddenly, this time with his eyes as well. &quot;As you can see, I survived. The magical being did indeed teach me many things. I became our village shaman, I took wives from the surrounding tribes since most of our women had been killed. I had many children, but I did not age. One day when my wives had all died, and my sons had grand children of their own, I left my village at the behest of my totem, and I have traveled ever since. I have trained many others during that time.
&quot;In my own tongue, we do not have the word for demon. Gods and spirits are capricious and cruel, and they make brutal sport with humans. I have since come to realize that demons do exist, and that mostly they inhabit the bodies of humans. I have destroyed many over the years.&quot;
&quot;Have you ever been back to your village?&quot;
His face turned wistful. &quot;Ah, my childhood companions had all died, my grand children were grown with children of their own when I left. I returned once or twice, but I found that truly we can never go back, that I was a stranger in my own village. All of you are embarking on the same path as I did, and you will find the same. To stay in one place is to stagnate, grow bored and die, but once you leave you become a stranger. Only in the company of other sorcerers will you not feel a stranger.&quot;
==&gt;
He pursed his lips, turned his gaze on Nalini and myself. &quot;Normally I do not concern myself with the affairs of ordinary humans or even fledgling sorcerers any longer. When Durathror told me that you two had banished not one but two gods, I had to see you for myself. I find it hard to credit, you seem so young and inexperienced. But Fin mak Morn gave you your gems at the behest of the eagle, which means that the eagle has seen something within you, or about you. Stand still, both of you.&quot; He walked in a slow circle about us.
&lt;&lt;Do you think he can spot anything that Durathror hasn't?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Durathror said we both looked like ordinary humans. How do we know we're not?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Well, we are soulmates, and we used the gems to banish two gods, there has to be something buried that we don't know about.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Durathror thought that was an artifact of the gems themselves. You think there's something more, don't you?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Of course Danny! I know you feel it too.&gt;&gt;
&quot;Do what ever it is you do to raise your powers.&quot; the Raven commanded.
Nalini and I held hands, gazed into each other's eyes, and let our minds slowly merge together. At those moments we feel like two halves of a greater whole. To think inside another's mind, to see through another's eyes. But that other is like a distorted image of myself, reflected by ruffled pond. And in the depths beneath the surface of the pond lies our true self, that greater whole that cries out triumphantly &quot;We are one! Our bond can never be sundered!&quot;
We thought about activating the powers of our gems, but the Raven cried &quot;Enough!&quot; We spiraled back to the realm of ordinary humans, and normality.
&quot;The two who are one!&quot; The Raven was standing close, staring at both of us fixedly. It was quite disconcerting.
&quot;Did you find what you sought?&quot;
&quot;I did. Your bond is your strength.&quot;
&quot;That's it? Nothing more?&quot;
The Raven smiled, an impish grin. &quot;There is much that I will not tell you yet. However, I will tell you this. Once, eons ago, you were powerful beings. In your pride you did evil, and you were punished. Ever since you have been crawling slowly back from the brink of the abyss. Do not hurry the process.&quot; He wagged a finger at us, much as Durathror does. &quot;One day, in the distant future, you will undoubtedly regain what you have lost. But you will be the better for your trials. The Eagle has seen fit to help you along with the gift of the gems.&quot;
It seemed much as Nalini and I privately surmised, but there must be more. &quot;Who created the gems? What is their relationship to us? What is your relationship to the Eagle.&quot; We spoke together, our minds still linked.
&quot;I am afraid you must find that out for yourselves...&quot; the Raven began.
Answers popped into our minds as they sometimes do, welling up from some vast depths. The gems were ours originally. And the Raven? The Eagle's brother...
&quot;Nay, speak it not!&quot; the Raven commanded. &quot;Keep your speculations to yourselves. They are doubtless wrong. But the gems were given you by the Eagle, use them for the Eagle's purposes. Do not look to your past, for it has no power. Look to your present, and the future you create from the present.&quot;
He stepped back, surveyed us. Just then Liz came jogging over, her eyes bright, a big smile on her face. &quot;Hey guys, can I join you? Imladril said I should.&quot;
The Raven smiled. &quot;Ah, little sister. You are always welcome. One day you will be a great sorcerer, and one day you will remember who you really are.&quot; His voice was almost a purr.
&quot;Uh, thanks. I'm Liz.&quot;
&quot;No, you call yourself that. You are the Kookaburra woman, whose laughter floats to the skies. I am the Red Raven of Destiny.&quot;
Liz looked at Nalini and then me, a puzzled look on her face. &quot;Um... I think I missed something there.&quot; She looked at the Raven.
&quot;No, one day you will remember who you are, and you will know what I mean.&quot; His voice was soft, but it hardened abruptly to what I assumed was his normal voice. &quot;All of you here will become great sorcerers, either in this life, or in subsequent ones! When the time is ripe, each of you will meet with one of my brother or sister sorcerers, who will become your mentor. Until then, study hard under your current mentors. I must leave now, one day we will meet again. I wish you all well.&quot;
He turned abruptly. &quot;Durathror, come, we must see about returning these people to their homes.&quot; He martialed all the people we'd rescued into the one group. Then they all faded out leaving a rainbow after image.
&quot;What an extraordinary person!&quot; Prospero exclaimed.
&quot;He is certainly extraordinary.&quot; Imladril responded, joining us. She looked pleased with herself. &quot;There is some doubt about whether he is a person, or one of the elder gods masquerading as a person. We refer to them collectively as the Old Sorcerers. They have incredible powers, but they do not seem to understand much about how they do what they do.&quot;
&quot;So what did he mean about calling me little sister and kookaburra woman?&quot;
&quot;What's a kookaburra?&quot; Prospero asked.
&quot;It's a bird about the size of a crow, but with a fatter body, longer beak, and it makes a noise like this: oo oo uh uh, oo oo uh uh, oo oo uh uh! You must have heard it.&quot; She managed quite a good imitation.
&quot;I have indeed heard it. It sounds very much like someone laughing.&quot;
&quot;I am glad you did that imitation&quot; Imladril smiled. &quot;I did not know what the word kookaburra meant either. We know very little about the old sorcerers. They are old, they are powerful. They take as their names the names of the elder gods: their leader is the Eagle Man, his consort is the Jaguar Woman, and there is the Red Raven, the Grey Wolf, the Brown Bear, the Black Puma, the Tiger and many more. They claim that these animals are their totem spirits. Durathror and I have often wondered whether they are indeed manifestations of the elder gods, playing games. There is no way we could tell though.&quot;
&quot;Why do you think they could be elder gods?&quot;
&quot;They are very ancient, very powerful, and their auras do not look human. That does not mean they are elder gods, they could be what we call magical beings, they could be the totem spirits from which they claim to take their names.&quot;
We explained about the swarms of hornets and the snakes. &quot;Do you know how he could do that?&quot;
Imladril shook her head, her beaded braids rustling slightly. &quot;To bring snakes or hornets from a distant shadow is easy for us, but we could never control them once they were here...&quot;
&quot;What about while we were on the way to Cromwell's England, and Durathror made the bandits do things to each other? Wasn't that controlling...&quot; Paula's voice petered out as if the explanation were dawning on her.
&quot;Minds can be influenced&quot; Imladril responded. &quot;And the influence will last for several hours. But that control does not extend to winnowing the good from the evil, as the snakes and the hornets were doing. Further, we can change the shape of objects, but we cannot change inanimate into living beings. You need a spirit to activate a living organism, and associating the two is like raising the dead. It can be done, but simply to create living creatures from smoke is beyond us. The only way I could create life is the way known to all women.&quot; She smiled.
&quot;Did the Viharani learn their sorcery from the old sorcerers?&quot;
&quot;No, I do not think so. Perhaps in the distant past our ancestors may have. We are concerned about the why and the how of the doing of sorcery; the old sorcerers are simply concerned with the doing, without understanding.&quot;
She shrugged. &quot;I am not sure if I like them, but Durathror and some others believe they have much knowledge they can teach. I find them rather strange.&quot;
&quot;I find them scary!&quot; Liz exclaimed. &quot;But what did he mean about one day I would remember who I was, and why did he call me kookaburra woman?&quot;
&quot;He is hinting that all of us are much more than we can remember in our waking lives, that we have other layers that have their own awarenesses. One day we will be able to integrate all of that into the totality of ourselves. In other words we will remember who we truly are. The term kookaburra woman means nothing to me. You may have to look into your own tribal stories to see if it has meaning.&quot;
&quot;Could he mean that Liz is somehow more than human? Or was little sister just a form of address?&quot;
Imladril laughed and shook her head. &quot;I think it was just a form of address, but he could mean anything. They love creating puzzles and mysteries for us to solve. That one is for you Liz, you must solve it yourself.&quot;
                                  ***
We said our goodbyes, and the five of us set off again for Nalini's and my home in Brisbane. Liz was happier and talkative this time.
&quot;Hey Liz, what did Imladril do you?&quot; Paula queried.
&quot;To be honest, I'm not sure now, but I feel like a load's been lifted from my shoulders. I didn't even realize it was there until we had to comfort those girls.&quot;
&quot;She performed a healing, Paula&quot; Nalini responded &quot;just like she did for me. It means that I can accept the things in my past as part of getting to where I am today. I'm no longer bitter about it, I don't often think about them, and when I do, they don't worry me. Liz, you'll find the same.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I no longer feel dirty or guilty or anything. It's just something that happened in the past. You're right Nalini, it doesn't bother me anymore.&quot;
&quot;You struck me as being pretty well adjusted anyway Liz. I don't think you had any major scars, you'd have never been able to relate to Rupert the way you did if there had been.&quot;
&quot;I hadn't thought about it like that, but I guess you're right. I think he helped the healing process too.&quot;
&quot;I thought he would, that's why I encouraged you. Danny was a major factor in my healing you know.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, I gathered that. I know you been down the same road I have, I figured that if you could enjoy things with Danny, I could enjoy them too. Uh... not with Danny I meant...&quot;
&quot;I know you didn't mean Danny&quot; Nalini interrupted. &quot;I know I can trust you with him.&quot; And we both trusted each other.
&quot;And you can trust me with him too!&quot; Paula added, ignoring a certain little incident between the three of us back about the time we had first met Prospero.
&quot;Yes Paula, I trust the two of you together.&quot; In other words, she trusted me, but the three of us knew that Paula still had the hots for me. Prospero didn't know this, and there was no benefit in going into that now.
&quot;Hey Liz, tell us all about Rupert! You've kept us in the dark too long. What's he like? What happpened between you two?&quot;
Liz sighed, then snapped &quot;I went to bed with him, that's all!&quot;
&quot;But there's much more than that! Nalini, tell her she has to tell us what happened.&quot;
Nalini shook her head. &quot;Paula, Liz is an adult. What she says is her decision, and hers alone. However Liz, I think all of us would like to hear about you and Rupert.&quot;
Liz raised her eyebrows, sucked in her lips, and looked around at us wide eyed. She sighed. &quot;I suppose I'll never get any peace until I tell you, will I?&quot;
&quot;Nah, of course not!&quot;
&quot;Paula, is this some sort of girl thing?&quot; I asked. There was a twinkle in my eye as I spoke. Paula often tags things that Prospero or I choose to do as &quot;guy things&quot;
&quot;Of course! And Liz is a girl, so she has to tell us!&quot;
&quot;You sure I'm a girl?&quot;
&quot;We..e..ll..ll&quot; Paula began
&quot;Nalini and I can vouch for her, Paula.&quot;
&quot;Oh ho! Tell me more!&quot;
&quot;Paula, we shared a bath, there's nothing else to tell.&quot;
&quot;Danny, talking about guys and sex is a girl thing, just we don't usually do it in front of guys, especially the guys we're talking about.&quot;
&quot;Except we're proposing to quiz Liz about Rupert.&quot; Nalini replied, amusement on her beautiful features. &quot;Liz, you don't have to tell us anything if you don't want to.&quot;
&quot;It's okay. Where do you want me to start?&quot;
&quot;Start with going to bed with him, and we'll take it from there&quot; Paula advised.
The conversation in fact jumped all over the place, as conversations often do. Rather than try to reconstruct that, or paraphrase it, I've asked Liz to write something in her own words.
LIZ I wasn't going to write anything, but Danny can be quite persuasive. He said he'd tizz this up a bit, but at least I get to tell things my way.
Rupert is basically a nice guy, we hit it off quite well. He doesn't seem to be into that racial purity thing that Germans got into later. The trouble is he's from Germany and England in the 1600s, so his outlook and customs are quite different. I guess he's a bit like Prospero there, only a bit more uptight about sex.
I guess it was quite a buzz really - this German Prince getting the hots for this little black chick. Only thing was, he didn't want to go through with it. He's such a prude really, uptight about the whole sex thing. He didn't want to take my virginity because I was a lady. If I'd been some serving girl he'd have had no problem, but I think he'd have kept his heart out of it then.
That's one thing that worried me about a long term relationship with him. He thought I was a highborn lady, cousin to Princess Nalini. Well my folks are poor, and indigenous as well, so a lot of people back home look down on us. Danny and Nalini don't, they've met my parents and some of my mob (=relatives - Danny). But Rupert's this prince, and I get the willies thinking of how to explain the reality of my background to him.
Anyway, this is getting ahead of things. The silly goose was really uptight about having sex with me. I didn't want to admit I wasn't a lady, so it was looking like nothing was going to happen. I mean, I was scared about sex, and he wasn't doing anything to help.
Well, I burst into tears, and between sobs told him about how I'd lost my virginity. Not all the details mind, just a sketchy outline. He was very quiet for a while, but he kept his arms around me and hugged me, which was probably what I needed right then. Finally he told me he didn't think any less of me. I interrupted him because I didn't want to get into the guilt trip, and I told him I wanted him to hug me, not be judgemental, and just talk to me. We must have talked for hours!
Turned out he wasn't a virgin (now why wasn't I surprised?), but it gave me a chance to upbraid him about why was it that it was okay for men to be experienced, but not women. Of course he answered that men were supposed to be virgins as well, but I countered that since he wasn't, and since I wasn't, what was the problem?
He ummed and arred a bit, so I asked him if he had some problem with my skin color. He told me it was nothing like that, but seeing as I was a lady he had pangs of conscience. I told him to pretend I was some serving maid in a bar and stop worrying about the niceties of things. I also made sure to tell him that it didn't matter if nothing happened, because I didn't want him to feel he was under pressure to perform.
I think I ended up telling him something like &quot;Rupert, stop worrying and just kiss me will you?!&quot;
He is actually quite a sensitive and attentive lover if he wants to be. (Jeez, I sound like some sleazebag who's had hundreds, don't I?). I had to show him how to use a condom, but once he realized what it was for, he seemed to relax a bit more. I can laugh about it now - he was uptight about doing it, I was uptight about doing it, but I wanted to go through with it to prove something to myself.
Well, I didn't come, at least now while he was in me, but I found I did enjoy the experience. I had to tell myself to relax before he could get in though. Surprisingly, he did have an idea about what to do with his fingers, and that worked. We lay there and talked for a while longer, then we made love again. I suggested he use his fingers on me before he went in. He continued while he was in me, and I came just after he came. It was a wonderful experience.
After that night things settled down, and he was a lot more confortable about sharing a bed with me. Well for that matter so was I.
Paula asked me if we are in love. Sigh. I love him, enough to miss him a lot, but maybe not enough to marry him. He did ask me to marry him, before we went home, but I turned him down. Part of me wanted to say yes, but there's all these things like cultural differences that we have to deal with first.
I told him that what he needed was a good woman who would settle down to be the lady of his estates, and give him children, and do all those things that noble women do to further their husband's standing.
&quot;Estates!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Alas my lady, I fear I have none. As the youngest son of a poor nobleman, I have little to offer a potential wife save my title. Though now the monarchy's restored, I should receive an estate and stipend from my cousin the king. I can understand your reluctance to marry someone such as myself.&quot;
I think I laughed at him. &quot;I don't have any estates either, Rupert. But I do have plans for a career. That's something your world doesn't allow women. I might enjoy being a nobleman's wife from time to time, but it isn't something I aspire to.&quot; Danny, I don't think I really used that word 'aspire'
&quot;It isn't your titles, or your estates. I think you would be better off marrying someone from your own culture, someone who would fit in, and would know what was expected of them. Face it Rupert, I'm a novelty. Most people in Europe have never seen someone with black skin before. But could you really see yourself taking me to all those balls and social functions, and watch me make small talk with a bunch of women who can't even read or write?&quot; Hey, have twelve years of school plus a business diploma from college. I'm proud of that. Okay, some of my folks can't read or write too well, but they're family, that's different.
He looked a bit crest fallen, but he smiled and said &quot;I admit you are a novelty, but not just because of your skin color. You have a mind of your own, you are not some vapid creature who talks about fashion and gossip and nothing else. You have more education than I have. I think you must be the first educated woman I have met.&quot;
&quot;Well, Nalini had a university degree, and Paula has a business diploma like mine. Back where I come from, most women are educated.&quot;
There was a twinkle in his blue eyes, and he smiled his devlish smile. Did I say he is quite handsome in a germanic way? All blond hair, pale skin and piercing blue eyes. Quite a contrast to my dark skin and hair, even more so than Danny and Nalini. &quot;But you are still unique. I can relate to you in a way I cannot relate to women here. I can talk to you about history, politics and other subjects and have a proper conversation. I would be very proud to have you by my side as my wife.&quot;
Like I said, part of me wanted to, but a larger part didn't want to jump in. &quot;I'm not ready to get married yet. There are things I want to do, things I want to learn, ask me again in eight or ten years. I'm learning to be a sorcerer, so you'll have to be able to walk by my side. You have to get to know me properly, eat the food that I cook, stay with my family, and see where I come from. Rupert, I don't like saying no, but I can't say yes yet.&quot;
He accepted that. I'd given him something to strive for. If things work out, maybe we will get married. After all, it's worked for Paula and Prospero.

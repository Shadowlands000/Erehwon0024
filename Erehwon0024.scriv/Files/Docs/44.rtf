\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We were quite a large party. There was Nalini and myself, Paula and Liz, Prospero and king Amrik, King Charles and his three cavaliers, Prince Rupert, Cromwell and the six puritans, Imladril, Iskandor, Durathror, Ra'anor, Enyil, Atlendor and his friend Perashil, like all the Viharani dark skinned and blonde haired, but with yellow eyes instead of green. We were escorted by a fifty of the king's palace guard, the elite of the elite. All of us were mounted on horseback. Durathror and Iskandor rode at the head of the column, the rest of the Viharani were distributed through the column. Nalini and I could relax and enjoy the ride instead of trying to shift shadows.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We were expecting an incident free trip, but things don't always work out that way.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The first we knew of trouble was the sound of cannon fire in the distance, followed by much closer explosions. Durathror had us halt, then a few of us rode ahead. He wanted just himself and Iskandor, but Amrik, Prospero and myself insisted on accompanying him. A few others followed us, including Cromwell and prince Rupert.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We rode to the edge of the forest, to a point where we could see what was happening. The forest was on the side of the hill, and ended abruptly, giving way to stony farmland. Ahead was a saddle of mountains, nestled underneath was a village about one hundred meters distant. Down in the valley were six large tanks and a small squad of bearded, khaki clad soldiers. As we watched, there was a puff of smoke from the turret gun of one of the tanks, followed by a loud explosion in the village. There was a column of frightened villagers heading toward the forest and us. It was obvious that many of them were wounded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik spat out an oath, his face grim. "We must stop this!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Yes" Durathror's face was hard.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Another explosion shook the hillside, this time from some distance below the skein of fleeing villagers, making it obvious the soldiers in the tanks were targeting them.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell spoke in surprise "They are killing the villagers!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They are." Durathror had a far-away look on his face. He did not speak for a moment, then exclaimed "I have them!" Three rocket launchers and nine rockets appeared at his feet. He and Iskandor began loading a launcher each. "This is what human warfare comes to, lord Cromwell. Soldiers in armored mobile canons women and children."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I leaped from my horse to use the third launcher, but Amrik beat me to it. At Durathror's look, he replied "I have used one of these before." referring to the events surrounding the time we had rescued him and Prospero. [*See Shadow of the Serpent] He slid the rocket into its tube, shouldered the launcher, and flicked off the safety.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "Then king Amrik, do you aim at the rearmost tank. Iskandor, take the one to its left" He put his eye to the sighting scope, and pressed the stud. The rocket made two pings indicating it had acquired a target. The others' rockets made similar noises.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Fire" Durathror commanded softly. Three trails of fire sped swiftly toward the tanks, followed by tremendous explosions. The three stooped to reload their launchers. When the smoke cleared, three of the tanks had disappeared, leaving large craters with flames pouring from them. Two more had been thrown on their sides. The last tank was swinging its turret gun around to target us. The three fired again, targeting the remaining tanks.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 This time we heard ragged cheers from the villagers. We had to wait for the smoke to clear before we could assess the situation. Many of the soldiers accompanying the tanks had been killed or injured in the explosions, but a few still stood, though they looked dazed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror turned. "We must see to the soldiers. Friend Amrik, keep an eye on things, and use the rockets if any more mobile canons appear." He, Atlendor and Iskandor set off down the slope and within five meters all were completely invisible.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik shook his head, a look of grim satisfaction on his face."Those butchers received no more than was their due! But this kind of warfare is unclean. I like it not."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell remarked soberly "You are right your majesty. This is devil's work."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril rode up and dismounted. "Nalini, we must see to the wounded. Danny, perhaps you and Prospero can come with us. But we must keep a watchful eye here lest those attackers have reinforcements. King Amrik, I am afraid your soldiers will be little use against such weapons, but you could use them to post a guard, and likely they will be needed to dig graves. This is a dangerous situation, I would be happier if we could move everyone somewhere safer."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik nodded grimly. "Your majesty, a soldier puts his life on the line to defend his country and his people. We will guard you as best we can, and dig graves. But those scum we destroyed are not soldiers, but common murderers." As we left, he was explaining to Rupert and Paula how to use the other two launchers.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There were perhaps a hundred villagers, many of them injured by shrapnel or burns. Some were missing body parts, or had other horrific injuries, these were the first to be dealt with. For many of the injured, time was critical, they could die if left untreated for long.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril, Enyil, Perashil and Ra'anor are all accomplished sorcerers. They used their sorcery to heal the injured, with miraculous results. They worked independently, each using some form of shape shifting sorcery. For example, Imladril would briefly run her hands through the injured person's aura, then exert her powers to reform the injured person's physical body in accordance with the shape the aura encoded. To the eye, the injured person's form would flicker several times, then return to focus as the uninjured person. Of course, performing this healing requires much energy, and is tiring on the healer.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 They worked swiftly, and had treated all the villagers within fifteen minutes. The villagers had been in shock, now many of them were dancing with delight and disbelief. Several told us that old existing ailments had gone. Some referred to Imladril as "the blessed virgin", though Imladril tried to explain she was no virgin. Ra'anor told them we were elves.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The villagers themselves were light skinned, dark haired Europeans. They spoke a language I tagged as Slavic since it reminded me of Polish, but I could not recognize it. We conversed using the translation spell, which operates via a modified form of telepathy.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There were very few men of military age in the group, they were mostly women and children and old people. There seemed to be some sort of civil war going on here; while I have little knowledge of the reasons behind it, my sympathies lie with the civilians who suffer at the hands of the soldiers.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik and a number of the others joined us before we had finished. He was carrying his rocket launcher over his shoulder, and his sword was belted to his waist. "How goes it?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Many of them were badly injured, they will all live. But we should check the village itself to make sure no one is trapped in the rubble." Nalini responded. I checked his launcher to ensure it was set to safe then checked those of Rupert and Paula.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror and Atlendor returned soon after, seeming to appear from nowhere. Durathror stated flatly "The soldiers are dead."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "All of them?" Cromwell asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "All. They are murderers all, they do not deserve to live!" Durathror stated emphatically.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik agreed. "The army is to protect civilians, not make war on them. Death is a risk for any soldier, but these have forfeited any right to be called soldiers. They are nothing more than brigands! Faugh!" he hawked and spat on the ground.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "We found five more mobile cannons in the next valley, and more soldiers. They bear the device of a white five-pointed star within a circle. Do any of you recognize it?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I looked at one another. "It could be some communist emblem from our shadow, but surely this isn't that?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell ventured "Do not witches use a five pointed star to symbolize their devil?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik asked "What of the other cannon?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh, we destroyed them all. They are rusted beyond recognition." He sighed "We are heading toward the English civil war. It seems there are echoes in other shadows. We must proceed with caution from here on."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril called across to him "Brother, we should check the village. There may be people trapped in the ruins!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The villagers were over their initial joy at rescue, and were now sadly mourning those they had lost. We led them to the ruins of their village.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The houses had been built from stone and wood, and painted white. Now many of them stood like the stumps of broken teeth along the gravel road that ran through the village. Fires blazed in many, while others had every window shattered. There were about thirty or forty dead bodies, though it was hard to count them. Some of them were children. One headless little girl still clutched a doll, now smeared with blood. Others were less pretty, bloodied and broken body parts spread about, and blood and shit splattered everywhere.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Liz buried her head against Rupert and sobbed. Cromwell stood there with tears in his eyes. King Charles looked around in disbelief and shock, then vomited. Durathror commented flatly "This is where your warfare leads, lord Cromwell, king Charles. Innocent civilians suffer."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We spent an hour sifting through the rubble, finding three survivors whom Imladril healed. Amrik showed several people how to use the rocket launchers, and left them with the villagers. Amrik also drafted our escort into grave digging. Hardened soldiers though they were, none was unaffected. We helped the villagers bury their dead, and then we left. They were collecting meager belongings in preparation for fleeing. Atlendor pointed out which direction would be safe. There was little else we could do.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We shifted twice, when Durathror held up his hand for silence. Somewhere off to the side we could hear screams and coarse laughter. "Stay here. We will investigate." He slid down from his horse. Iskandor and Atlendor followed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik made to follow, but Atlendor shook his head. "You are too noisy for this." They melted into the forest.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik commented "I can see now why they did not want me with them. I am good, but even I cannot vanish like that!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We waited in silence for five or ten minutes, whereupon Imladril announced "They need us. Follow me."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 She led us through the dense forest onto another trail, and thence to a clearing. At first sight there appeared to be lots of bodies lying about, some soldiers and some civilians. Most of the civilians were naked and had been mutilated. Some were obviously dead, but were hideously disfigured, with eyes gouged out, tongues torn out, bits of body missing, and carvings into their flesh. The dead were elderly or middle aged, the living were all female, and young. Some were not even at puberty. Many of the living were also mutilated, and it seemed obvious that they had been savagely raped and bashed. Imladril and Enyil flew from their horses to assist the injured.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The soldiers were all lying in a heap, jerking spasmodically as if being electrocuted. Most were either without trousers, or with their trousers around their ankles. Amrik took in the scene then stormed toward the soldiers, his fists clenched. "Death is too good for them!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror stopped him. "Correct, Amrik. Do nothing to them. Their punishment will be that they shall do to each other what they did to their victims."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He turned and stalked back along the trail. The so-called soldiers staggered after him, carrying their rifles and knives. Prospero, Amrik and I fell in behind them. We walked for several hundred meters till we reached a cleared area where two military trucks and an armored jeep were parked. There was no one there, but it appeared that this was how the soldiers had brought their victims to this place.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Even as we stood around, the soldiers stripped off their clothes and began fighting amongst one another. Several used clawed fingers to gouge the eyes out of the others. Durathror commented "Those who gouged eyes will have their eyes gouged out. What ever they did, one of their companions will do that to them." Some used knives to sever one another's tongues and other body parts, including penises. A few savagely beat others into submission with their rifle buts, then proceeded to anally rape them, sometimes with rifle barrels if they had lost their penises.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "The spell will last for about five hours. They will not kill one another, but they will not cease until then. None will die, their wounds will crust over rapidly enough to prevent too much blood loss."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What's he carving?" Amrik asked. One soldier was carefully carving words into the chest of his comrade, who screamed and roared in pain, but was powerless to stop it.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "In his own language, the words read 'I did this to children.' They will live, they will recover, and they will live with the shame for the rest of their lives. Let us leave them to their pleasures." Their screams of agony followed us down the trail.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 By the time we returned, the living were healed and clothed, but not comforted. They told us the soldiers had come into their village earlier and rounded them all up at gunpoint, driven them here, and then proceeded to rape and torture all of them.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril spoke to the rest of us. "To fix this we must destroy the entire attacking army, and then we must also destroy their rulers who let things come to this. We are not gods, this is beyond us. We cannot leave them here, and I do not even know where we can take them that is safe, since they do not know. It would be terrible if this were to happen again tomorrow."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril probed their minds, and discovered that safety lay across the border in another country some two hundred miles away. They knew the direction.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror turned to Imladril "Sister, I think it best we take them there. Give me leave to scout out the place." He walked over to a large tree, and sat with his back against it. His eyes closed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell nudged me. "What is he doing?" His visage was sickly, like a man who has looked on horror he did not know existed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "He is sending his spirit to scout out this land, and discover a place of safety for these villagers. We cannot leave them here, and we cannot return them to their village."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 After about ten minutes, his body became limned in rainbow light, then winked out. Several of the rescued villagers gasped in astonishment.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril turned to the villagers, saying "We must go now, and take you to a place of safety. The rest of you please stay here." Enyil, Perashil, Ra'anor, Nalini and I gathered the villagers together. I had two teenage girls by the hand. Suddenly a rainbow doorway appeared to open before us, shimmering like a gossamer veil. Durathror stood on the other side. Imladril walked though, and the rest of us followed. A little way away there were parked trucks bearing the insignia of a red cross on a white background. Some people were standing around talking, and then suddenly there was shouting as some of them noticed us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The next moment we were surrounded. Durathror explained simply "We rescued these people from soldiers who massacred the rest of their village. Please help them. Most of them have been beaten and raped." Hands reached out to the refugees.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Who are you?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "How did you rescue them?" voices called out.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We are elves" was Durathror's simple reply. "We must go now."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He led us back up the hill, and then with a shimmer we were back in the clearing. We waited while Amrik's soldiers buried the dead, then we moved on again. There were no further incidents, though the gaiety had left us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 An hour later, Durathror brought us to England at Marston Moore, the scene of the battle some five weeks before. It was not a pretty sight. The dead lay where they fell, unburied, bodies bloated and rotting. Bones poked through where decaying flesh had rotted off, or been eaten by wild animals and birds. The stench was unbelievable. Many of the corpses had been robbed, much of the armor and equipment was missing. Even sadder than the dead soldiers was the number of dead horses. It occurred to me that Durathror had sought out the other incidents especially for Charles, Cromwell and the English.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror turned and spoke in English. "Lord Cromwell, King Charles, this is the scene of Cromwell's victory over prince Rupert. But for Danny, Prospero and their friends, prince Rupert would be lying there now." His voice rose with emotion "This is the aftermath of your great victory! This is the glory of warfare! You two bear joint responsibility for starting this war, and you two bear joint responsibility for all these deaths. Look upon your handiwork both of you! This is the legacy of your pride!" he thundered.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The king and the usurper looked at one another. Neither was looking particularly happy or proud. Cromwell muttered "Soldiers die in warfare. It is not pretty, but that is what war is about."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Wrong Cromwell, war is about over-reaching ambition in the rulers, who then send out their soldiers to fight and die. You were not responding to an invasion! Neither of you had any excuse for this! Sometimes a soldier must put his life on the line, but that must be to defend his people and his country. Never should you make war on your own people, as you two have done. This is an abomination in god's sight! Neither of you are fit to rule the country, but I doubt that any of your fellow countrymen are any better."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We rode on, taking the road south. Durathror had obviously scouted the route in advance, because to ride to London would take five days. We shifted shadows many times along the road, but called in at the major towns along the route. We found out later that the rumor mill started working overtime at the sight of six elves riding white unicorns, and flanked by fifty warriors clad in burnished armor. Many also recognized the Lord Protector or King Charles.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The towns we visited all had an area set aside for executions, and each time we rode past the gibbets. In each case there were long rows of swinging bodies, many of them elderly, or women, or children, and most in various stages of decay.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The first time, Durathror turned again and spoke in English. "Puritans! This is where your zeal for purity leads! You have murdered innocent women and children. All of you stand guilty of that, you all argued for the inquisition in your parliament. Are you any better than those soldiers we destroyed earlier today?! You make me sick!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 At the next town we rode past thirty two women and children swinging on the gallows. None had been dead for more than a day or so. Durathror thundered "Hypocrites! What would Jesus think of you? You have betrayed his teachings, and worshipped the devil!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell and Matthew had the decency to hang their heads in shame. Most of the puritans looked embarrassed. Henry looked belligerent, mumbling something under his breath.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror countered "I know you would like to see me swinging there, Henry. But you still follow Satan, as do all who preach the way of death. Your path will destroy you. Beware!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell turned to look at baron henry. "Henry! Prince Durathror is correct, the witch inquisition was evil. Satan blinded all of us. We have done much evil, believing it to be good. Now we return to make amends. Think on this. We will talk later."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 At each town, we also paused while Cromwell and king Charles spoke briefly to the local garrison commander, and delivered a written proclamation. We had had a number of these prepared before we left Bendora, and both Cromwell and King Charles had signed them and sealed them with their seals.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The proclamation stated that King Charles and Lord Protector Cromwell had signed a peace treaty ending the civil war. The king was restored to his throne, the declaration of outlawry was rescinded. The witch inquisition was dismantled. The parliamentary soldiers were directed to lay down their arms and return to their homes. Those who did so would be granted amnesty, those who refused would be prosecuted for treason.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Toward evening, we rode into the courtyard of Hampton Court Castle, about half a day's ride from London itself. The sky was clouding over, threatening rain later. Typical English summer really.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Our arrival caused consternation. The castle was not ready to receive so many unannounced guests, and there was a flurry of activity to prepare rooms and food. More important however were the rumors. Cromwell was dead, kidnapped by brigands along with the parliamentary leaders. King Charles had paid the brigands, or had also been killed by the brigands, or had fled to France.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 In the wake of this, what remained of the parliament had appointed general Archibald Campbell, eighth Earl of Argyll as the new Lord Protector. The Scots had declared Charles dead, and crowned his son as Charles II of Scotland. Charles II was now claiming rights to the throne of England, but with little support from parliament.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles I arranged for his proclamation to be sent to the new lord Protector, the various generals and parliamentarians that evening. Included with that was a hastily penned note inviting each to attend a meeting at Hampton Court on the morrow, and signed by both Charles I and Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A group of us sat in the main dining hall at Hampton Court, discussing what to do next. The hall was large and draughty, its walls covered with dark wood wainscoting half way up, and with white painted plaster above that. Numerous dark pictures of past royals and nobles hung on the walls. There were also a number of chandeliers sporting hundreds of lighted candles.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell seemed smugly satisfied. "They will not accede to your demands! Argyll will have this place surrounded by parliamentary troops. He has no love for you Charles, not since you tried to have him murdered."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That is a base slander! We had no knowledge of any plot to murder him..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "No? You instructed the would be murderers yourself!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We did not! But Argyll ordered the murders of the Earl of Stafford and the Archbishop of Canterbury!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They were sentenced to death for treason after a trial! Whereas you..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "ENOUGH!" I banged the table with my fists. They both looked at me in surprise. I continued more mildly, though still forcefully "Both of you have crimes on your consciences, neither of you has clean hands. The past is the past, and cannot be changed. We are here to protect the future, and to prevent England from slipping back into the dark ages. You have both agreed to let bygones be bygones, to patch up your relationship, and to work together to make England a better and fairer place. We are here to discuss how to manage the transition from the current situation out there to the new government, one in which both of you will play key roles. As I see it, our first task is to re-establish Cromwell as lord Protector, and these puritans as the executive parliamentary committee. Once that happens, the civil unrest will be manageable, and we can hold the investiture to reinstate Charles as king. To accomplish that, we must convince the acting Lord Protector and his cronies that this is the correct thing to do."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero added "Which is why all of them are invited here for the meeting. But they may not come, or they may bring an army with them. If they bring their armies, we will meet with them, and convince them that they have nothing to fear."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror interrupted "If they bring their armies, Iskandor and I will deal with that. What will you do if they will not come?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We deal with those who do come. Those who will not attend must either be fetched here and included in the negotiations, or neutralized." I commented.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero nodded. "We may have to neutralize many of them. But we do need the current leaders here to deal with. The fact that Charles and Cromwell are not dead gives the lie to any claim of legitimacy they may have."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But why must they meet us here? Why can we not meet them in parliament?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero stated something that was obvious to some of us. "Because they may have an interest in Charles and you remaining dead. You could both be murdered and your bodies hidden."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But we parliamentarians are god fearing men!" Cromwell protested. "We do not stoop to murder like Charles does."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "If you were god fearing men, you would not have a civil war on your consciences!" Durathror observed acidly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 It took a little while to stop the recriminations and get the discussion back on track. Cromwell and the puritans were less inclined to give ground, and wanted things they had agreed to overturned. Charles would have liked to have all the parliamentarians arrested, but he lacked an army to back him on that.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero was dreading the prospect of commencing negotiations again with another group of rulers. What was more, the witch inquisition was continuing, and innocent people were being tortured and murdered daily because of it.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We devised some general guidelines, but we wound have to wait for the new leaders to arrive the next day before we could see how things might unfold.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The facilities in the palace left something to be desired. There were no indoor toilets unless you made use of a chamber pot. The outdoor toilets were windy holes in the ground behind the stables. The palace was cold even in summer, and there was very little provision to heat water, especially for bathing. I think the Aquilonian contingent put a considerable strain on the resources of the palace.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Toward midmorning the parliamentary army arrived under the generalship of the Earl of Argyll. Several other parliamentarians were with him, but not all. He sent an emissary to ask for our surrender.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero remarked "Lord Cromwell, I think you must insist on meeting him in person. He will not be convinced of your bona fide otherwise."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell smiled sardonically. "After plucking me from England, and badgering me to turn parliament's proclamations on their ends, now you want me to help you pull your irons from the fire?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Lord Cromwell, you yourself agreed to the changes we seek to make..." Prospero began.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Under duress" Cromwell interrupted.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Cromwell" I barked. "We don't have time for this crap! You back that agreement one hundred percent, or get lost. You agreed to it, now is the time to implement it. You either help out or we cut you out of the process, and deal with the others. But your hands are stained with the blood of innocent English! You must make amends."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell looked at me with an angry expression on his face, but it softened. He nodded "You are correct, the mistakes are partly mine, so I must help redress them. Argyll will not lay down arms unless he is convinced that I am alive and support the proclamation. I had thought that with a new lord protector, I could return to my home and my family."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Once we have sorted out the transition to the new government. Then you may step down if you wish. Prospero, do you think Charles should also meet with the earl of Argyll?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Under a flag of truce, it could be arranged. It would show that Charles and Cromwell have indeed signed a truce, but it might be too much of a temptation to the earl of Argyll to capture king Charles."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We will not meet with Argyll out there. He must come to us." Charles stated flatly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I was growing tired of all this pettiness. "Charles, the same applies to you as to Cromwell. You agreed to this process, you support it one hundred percent, and help us to run it. If you don't..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You dare to threaten us?" This was not the meek Charles we had seen in Aquilonia.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I do not threaten." I replied coldly and levelly. "England needs a king, but it needs one who can govern sensibly. The Scots have already crowned your son. The English can do the same. You either join the process willingly, and behave sensibly as you did in Aquilonia, or we cut you out of it. You become plain Charles Stuart, retired king, and little to do except attend to your balls and your hunts."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles glowered at this, but Cromwell smiled in satisfaction. "I may not like your methods, Earl Daniel, but at least you are even handed! I will send a messenger asking Argyll to meet me under a flag of truce."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles went into a sulk, walking to the other end of the room and sitting staring into the fire. He ignored us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A little later, Cromwell, Durathror and I walked out to meet with the Earl of Argyll. Cromwell asked me as we walked "Would you really cut Charles out of the process, and make his son king in his stead?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "If necessary. I have no loyalty to him or any other. We negotiated a settlement that we believe is fair, and I thought that you and Charles both supported it as a reasonable compromise to stop the civil war and restore England to good government. If his removal from office is legal, then there is no requirement to reinstate him as king. We simply need a king, someone who is acceptable to parliament, the nobles and the people."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell nodded. "I think many in parliament would be happier to see Charles' son on the throne. But the settlement we negotiated would put checks upon the kings powers, and might make Charles acceptable to parliament."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We are relying on you and your friends to sway the rest of parliament. Do you still support the deal?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell sighed. "I do Daniel, as you say, it is fair, it bolsters the powers of parliament and curbs those of the king, yet it also imposes checks against the abuse of power by any in government. Our current system has no checks upon the powers of the parliament. You have convinced me that the proposed system is superior."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror observed "In you current system the powers of the office of Lord Protector are almost the same as those of the king. If you seek to curb the kings powers, then similar curbs must be placed upon the lord protector's powers."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We had to walk almost two hundred meters from the palace to meet with the Earl of Argyll. The idea was that the meeting place was far enough away that we need not fear rifle fire.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Argyll rode up with two aids and dismounted about twenty meters distant. As he dismounted, a squad of cavalry galloped up and threatened us with muskets. Durathror was here partly in case of such an eventuality.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Tell me why I should not have you summarily shot!" the earl called out to us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell made to speak, but I spoke first. "Because you are a man of honor, and a man of god, you would not have us shot without a trial. But you break the truce by bringing your musketeers here. Send them away so that we can talk."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Brave words! Why should I trust a brigand?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell got his reply in first "Argyll! He is no brigand. It is I, Oliver Cromwell! Send your musketeers away. Charles and I have signed a peace treaty."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oliver! Is it really you?" He stumped closer, peering myopically at us. He was stout in build and florid of face, in late middle age, and seeming to suffer from arthritis or gout. He walked slowly toward us until he could see Cromwell clearly enough.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It is I, Argyll. Charles and I have signed a peace treaty."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It is you after all! Well sir, it warms my heart to see you alive. We had heard you had been kidnapped by brigands, and murdered. Are you well?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I am well, though I did not expect you would threaten me under a flag of truce."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The earl of Argyll sent the musketeers back to his massed army. "So, why should we accept Charles as king? What sort of peace treaty have you signed?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "This is why we invited you to Hampton Court, along with all the key parliamentarians. We have a peace treaty, we have an agreement to a new form of parliamentary government, with curbs upon the king's powers. We need the parliamentary leaders here to discuss it. We do not need your army."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The earl nodded. "You guarantee our safety? Who are these people with you?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell introduced us, and added "They are envoys of the king of Aquilonia. They helped broker the peace accord. I can vouch for them, they are god fearing people, and mean you no harm."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The two spoke some more before the earl of Argyll was finally convinced. Then he and Cromwell ran through a list of names of people who should attend.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The two men shook hands. The earl of Argyll said "Well Cromwell, they should all be happy to hear you are alive and well. God willing, we will return this afternoon." He mounted his horse, and rode back to his army.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell seemed pleased with himself. He rubbed his hands. "So, the process will start. I will perform my part, let us hope that Charles will perform his part."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I hope so too. The outcome is too important to be stopped by an individual who sulks because he cannot have everything his own way. We are trying to ensure fairness to all, and he is in a position of privilege. I have little sympathy for him."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "And I thought your sympathies lay more with him than with me."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I chuckled. "On the contrary, lord Cromwell. Perhaps that was why I have been harsher with you than with him. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I must remember that one, it is a turn of phrase I have not heard, but very apt. The king is certainly corrupt."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Thank you. But the same applies to anyone who has absolute power. I do not approve of any man having god like powers over their fellows." I had noticed before that when conversing with the English, I tended to a more archaic turn of phrase. "We are all fallible, our best protection when we govern is that we have a committee of peers who will review and if necessary amend the laws we make. The House of Commons and the House of Lords are those committees. It is not perfect, but it is the best we can devise."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell was musing. "Yes, I once felt that we should try to create a perfect society here, but you reminded me that only god is perfect, and to style ourselves the parliament of saints as some have designated parliament is to fall prey to the sin of pride. Satan has so many traps for those who would follow Christ."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror added "Satan has many traps, but god sets many tests, as he did to Job. If you would be a good Christian, then you must rise to those tests. If you would lead men, you must set an example to others. As a ruler, your tests are even harder."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Do you think the army will retreat?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell shook his head. "I have my doubts. Argyll knows the king is within, he has him surrounded. He means to end this civil war one way or the other. Capturing the king would achieve his aims."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Provided the army does not try to attack, it can sit there for as long as it likes. If it does attack, it will be repulsed." Durathror offered.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That would mean bloodshed" Cromwell warned. "The civil war would not end."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled. "Do not fear, lord Cromwell, there will be no bloodshed. We would prefer that they do not try to attack, so that you are hailed as the peacemaker, and the reforms will then be more readily accepted."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I need no accolades, prince Durathror."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Our purpose is the reforms to the form of government. You had the authority as lord protector, and you had parliament's respect." I countered. "As the peacemaker, your credibility goes up. The reforms then become what you have always been trying to achieve. They are easier to implement, because they would have the support of the parliament."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Parliament has many factions. But perhaps you are right, lord Daniel, with the peace treaty we achieve our aims honorably, without the need to execute the king for treason. I would prefer to face my maker free from the stain of regicide."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "So would we, lord Cromwell." I replied. "But tell me, aren't we half a days ride from London? How then can he return with the others this afternoon?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh, you would not know, but there is a train line from here to London. The station is perhaps ten minutes on horseback. I expect that Argyll came here by train, his arthritis will not allow him to sit on a horse for too long. I believe the journey is but half an hour."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror chuckled "Didn't you know, Danny? That was one of the reasons we chose this palace. It is outside London, but the train makes it a quick journey. We were hoping that king Charles would grant it to us as our embassy." He added to me in a mental aside <<And London is so filthy you would not want to stay there.>> There was an image of a town with refuse and fecal matter piled in the streets, rats everywhere, unwashed people who stank to high heaven and were rife with fleas and lice. In a few years time they would be ravaged by the black death.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Here is better, I agree. I think we would have a mutiny from the Aquilonian contingent if we put them in London.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I doubt he would do that!" Cromwell was astonished. "This is a royal palace, he holds those very tightly."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Ah, but he is not yet restored as king, and that may not happen should he continue to behave as he is."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0  Charles did not eat in the dining hall, we presumed he was sulking somewhere else in the palace.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Mid afternoon, Durathror asked us if we would like to head over to the station and wait for the train that was arriving soon. Most of us decided to do so, and with the accompanying escort of Aquilonian soldiers there was probably at least forty or fifty of us on horseback.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We followed a leafy pathway across the estate's grounds, until a detachment of parliamentary soldiers sought to bar our passage. Cromwell rode forward to deal with this.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Captain, do you recognize me?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Zirr, oi believe 'ee be tha Lord Cromwell." His accent was thick.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Correct, I am the Lord Protector of the commonwealth. Now stand aside and let us pass. We wish to await your general the Earl of Argyll."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But zirr, 'ee be tha lord protectorr, not 'ee. At least oi think zo."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Captain, you are not paid to think, but to follow orders. I am the Lord Protector, as well you know. The Earl of Argyll has been acting in that capacity while I was away. Now I have returned. Surly you can comprehend that?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The captain scratched his jaw, then nodded. "Tha' mun be rroit. 'Ee be 'irr, and not 'im. Zo 'ee mun be lord protectorr ztill. Zirr, you may pazz!" He turned to his squad. "Ztand asoid an' let they lord protectorr pazz!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I looked around as we waited, and spied several other squads of soldiers at varying distances. It looked to me as if the army did indeed surround Hampton Court. We proceeded to the station.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was a single narrow track running off into the distance. The station was a simple platform of stone with a small hut at one end. The ground sloped toward the track, and the platform had been constructed so that while it was raised beside the track, the other side was level with the ground, making it easy to drive carts onto and off the platform. The track extended away from the platform in both directions, but to our left we could see that the track ran in a big loop, allowing a train to turn around and head back to London. It was all very rural looking, but give it four hundred years and all that would be left would be the palace gardens; the rest would be sold for residential sites.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We didn't have long to wait before we could hear the train chugging its way along the track. A few minutes later it appeared. It was a flat platform mounted on six steel wheels. A large water tank occupied at least half the platform, with a boiler and firebox set behind. The driver and the stoker stood behind that, exposed to the elements, with little but some brass railings to prevent them from falling off. Behind the engine was the fuel cart, half full of split logs. Behind that were two boxy looking carriages made of painted wood and brass work, and behind them were three flat cars with high walls and carrying horses.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The train rolled slowly into the station and ground to a halt with a few screeches and shudders. We waited patiently while the passengers disembarked and the small squad of soldiers unloaded the horses. Cromwell and a few others went over to greet the new arrivals. Prospero asked prince Rupert and myself to accompany him to the engine so he could have a good look.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Introductions were performed, people mounted up, and eventually we rode back to Hampton Court. The domestic staff went into a flap trying to arrange rooms for everyone, an evening meal and refreshments.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 It was a little before four thirty in the afternoon before we all sat around in the dining hall, sipping tea or coffee, and nibbling on small cakes and slices of bread with jam or honey. Charles was conspicuous by his absence.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 One parliamentarian, Thomas Pride I think, asked "A peace treaty is all well and good, but why should the king of Aquilonia and the queen of the Viharani be privy to the affairs of England?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They will not be so privy, but they helped to broker the peace accord, and they will help us with some of the reforms. They offer friendship and advice." Cromwell observed smoothly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik replied "I am the king of Aquilonia, I can appreciate you would not want us present and meddling in your affairs. We will not meddle, beyond helping to see the peace accord implemented. We can offer some advice, but we also hope to learn from you good people. Seven years ago we fought a civil war and deposed and executed our despotic and tyrannical king. I am now the king, but with duke Prospero and Earl Daniel, we are setting about a reform of government, introducing houses of parliament along similar lines to yours, and curbing the powers of the king. As I said, we can offer you advice, but we can also learn from you. We wish to present you with the settlement that has been negotiated, but after that, should you wish to hold discussions on private, that is your prerogative, and we will remove ourselves from this chamber."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 They put it to a vote, there were nine against us being there, the rest were for it. Then they became embroiled in a procedural discussion about who was lord protector, Cromwell or the earl of Argyll. There was an argument that it should remain with Argyll, there was an argument that the assumptions were wrong, and that Argyll could never have been validly appointed, which had implications for the decrees they had made in the past few weeks. Some seemed to think that they needed the full assembly to sort that one out.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The rest of us were growing increasingly irritated, until Prospero urged me to interrupt. "My lords, might I make a suggestion? The earl of Argyll was appointed Lord Protector on the assumption that lord Cromwell was dead. Rumors of his death have obviously been exaggerated, that certainly means the assumption under which the earl of Argyll assumed the office was incorrect. But lord Cromwell was out of the country, it was necessary to have someone appointed as acting Lord Protector for the duration. I would think that the earl of Argyll was validly appointed, but his appointment can only be valid for the period of lord Cromwell's absence. Now that Lord Cromwell has returned to England, he is again the lord protector, unless he desires to step down in favor of someone else. So, the earl of Argyll has been validly appointed Lord Protector, but that office now reverts to Lord Cromwell. It should be similar to an army in the field, when the commanding officer is incapacitated."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 They argued some more, but the military among them agreed with my assessment. Argyll himself stood and declaimed "If the general is captured or believed killed, command passes to the next in line. Any orders the officer issues are valid until the general resumes the field. Of course my appointment was valid! Now that Lord Cromwell has returned, he resumes the office of Lord Protector!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Finally it was settled, and they agreed to listen to the accord. Durathror interrupted with "Should we not have Charles here?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There were some refusals. Argyll stated emphatically "Only so long as he sits over there! I will not have him sitting anywhere near me."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 They took their time discussing it, then put it to the vote. This time there were eleven against and twenty nine for Charles being present.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror excused himself, saying "I go to persuade him to honor us with his presence."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Careful he doesn't have you beheaded for treason!" quipped one of the parliamentarians. I'm afraid I do not know the names of most of them.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "He'd have to find an executioner first. I thought they were all in your pay!" Durathror responded flippantly as he departed. I don't think all the English got the joke.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 They began arguing over how Charles should be addressed, but Cromwell quickly quashed that. "I have rescinded the decree of outlawry. The treaty also provides that Charles be restored to his throne. If we ratify the treaty, he will again be his majesty. If we do not, then he is still deposed. That was done legally, he is to be addressed by the title of Prince Charles the senior, or simply Your Highness, but not Your Majesty."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 John Pym observed acidly "If his removal from the throne were not done legally, then all of us stand here guilty of treason. We are the parliament, we constitute the law making body of England, we passed the law deposing king Charles. So, 'twas done legally. QED"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A little later a somewhat subdued Charles Stuart entered the dining hall. I think Durathror had done something to make him acquiescent. Many of the parliamentarians rose to their feet when he entered, but Cromwell bade them sit. "He is not yet restored, he should not be accorded that honor until he is restored."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles surveyed the room, then remarked "Good afternoon gentlemen. It is pleasing to see that some of you remember your manners. As you see, you are not rid of me so easily..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror interrupted "Charles, find a chair and sit down!" Charles sat on the first chair he came to, sitting beside Liz. "and stop behaving like a naughty schoolboy." There were gasps from the assembled puritans. Charles himself looked shocked, but sat quietly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror continued "I am afraid I am a military man, with a soldier's love of plain speaking. You must forgive me if I sometimes appear rude. Now, Danny and I will read out the agreement, and answer questions about it. After that it will be up to you to discuss it, but it has been agreed by both lord Cromwell and lord Matthew for parliament, and by Charles himself. I am sure you will realize that altering the agreement will mean that neither parliament nor Charles is bound by it, and the civil war continues, unless all parties here can agree to the changes. We" he indicated the Viharani and Aquilonians "are here as observers, and as facilitators for any negotiations you might wish to hold with Charles. While you can discuss the agreement in private, any negotiations about changes will have to be done in the presence of the facilitators."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was something about his voice that seemed to compel obedience. The puritans looked at each other, and nodded agreement. Cromwell said "You may proceed Prince Durathror."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We wished to avoid the obvious use of translation spells, which might cause alarm to the puritans. Thus it was necessary to have someone who could read English read out the agreement. Unfortunately for the girls they were disqualified simply because puritan England was extremely chauvinistic, and did not permit females to play an active role in any form of government or negotiations. To quote Samuel Johnson "A woman preaching is like a dog walking on its hind legs. It is not done well, but the marvel is that it is done at all."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I quote this simply to show the attitude prevalent amongst not only the puritans, but also prevalent among the general population.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror and I took it in turns to read paragraphs from the agreement. We stopped frequently as what we read provoked disagreement. Rather than try to debate the contentious point immediately, we wrote the issue up on a black board, and continued. Many of the politicians were not happy with this approach, but we kept pointing out that until they had heard the complete agreement they couldn't see how things fitted together. I kept reminding them that they should treat it like the reading of a proposed bill, where the debate happened after the reading.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There were a number of issues, many of them religious based. They would be harder to address, neither Durathror nor I could decide whether they should be first, last, or simply dealt with in order of writing. Prospero favored the order of writing, Durathror favored dealing with them first, I preferred to deal with them later. We broke for dinner, agreeing to discuss the issues after. We ended up going through the issues in order.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Most of them wanted an end to the civil war, which was gratifying. However, they weren't so concerned about the civil suffering, but they could all perceive that the war was weakening England, and would encourage catholic monarchs such as the king of Spain and the king of France to invade in support of their own claims on the English throne.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 One of the conditions was that Charles be restored to the throne with reduced powers. Unfortunately few of them actually wanted Charles back at all. The general consensus was that Charles was despotic, arrogant, unreliable and treasonous for his involvement with France and for starting the civil war. Some of the subtle points were lost on the rest of us, but they alleged that Charles had started the war with his indecisive attack at Edgehill near Nottingham in 1642. His treasonous relationship with France seemed to be because of his marriage to the French Princess Henrietta Maria. The French of course were catholic, which angered the puritans.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles sat and glowered at the speakers as they ran through their litany of complaints against him. I felt he was marking each speaker in his memory, and would extract vengeance later.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell took the floor and quite surprisingly spoke eloquently about how the office of lord Protector was just as open to autocratic abuse as having a monarch, while having a monarch supplied them with stability. He argued that no man was perfect, and that good government should not be predicated upon the goodness of a single individual. Instead, the government had to have checks and balances to ensure that while good men could shine, capricious men could be curbed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Prince Charles the senior has accepted this agreement, including the curbs and controls upon the powers of the monarch. The monarch and the Lord Protector are jointly commanders of the army, this agreement stipulates that neither can attack the other. Whoever does so will be impeached and removed from office. That includes the king! Should he seek to threaten Parliament again as he did in the past, it would be illegal for him to command the army to do so. The generals would have no choice but to refuse, and have him arrested. Once we ratify these changes to the form of government, then the king cannot undo them without the approval of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The parliamentary changes seemed more acceptable since it granted the House of Commons more power, including that of veto over legislation passed by the House of Lords or the Monarch. The budget for running the country was to be framed jointly by a committee of the king and his advisors and members drawn from the Houses of Parliament. Charles had been very unhappy about that, but he wanted his throne back, and agreeing was the only way for that to happen.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was much religious argument about the abolishing of the witch inquisition, but Cromwell and Matthew would not budge. They had been convinced of the evil of the inquisition, and argued quite strongly against it.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Through all this Charles sat looking bored. He made it plain he had absolutely no interest in these proceedings. Amrik was another who looked bored, though he at least tried to conceal it. Imladril and Iskandor looked pre-occupied, as if they were involved in sorcery and had only half a mind for the proceedings.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Henry spoke up for the faction arguing for stronger measures against Catholics, and wanted the witch inquisition to continue. The line "The only good catholic is a dead catholic" was uttered and supported by a number of puritans.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "And what of the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill'? Yet you would murder Christians because they disagree with you!" I interjected. "Take the log from your own eye before you remove the spec from your brother's eye!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell waved me down. "Gentleman, once I agreed with you. We all thought that to be a good Christian, it was necessary to correct the errors in others' thoughts. If they would now willingly allow themselves to be so corrected, then we executed them to prevent their pollution from spreading. Then one day Lord Daniel, the Earl of Bendora, quoted scripture to me, and challenged me to find a scriptural basis for any deeds we had done. But he went further than that, and challenged me to find a passage that showed what god intended we should do in this situation. I have searched the scripture to find passages appropriate to what we do, and I searched with an open mind, to discover god's will on these matters.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I have found that it is easy to find a passage that will support any action we have taken, but I can also find passages to suggest we have taken the wrong action. How can both these be right? How can the bible be wrong? I give credit where credit is due. Earl Daniel told me to look at the old covenant and the new, and to determine which parts of the bible pertain to the old covenant and not the new. Lord Matthew and Sir Mark, together with Simon Lambert, Thomas Pride and I have looked deeply into this matter over the past five weeks. Let me tell you what we found!" His voice was rising.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We found that we have done evil in the name of good! We have followed the old covenant, and not the new!" He thundered. "Our strongest argument for executing those who will not change their opinions comes from Leviticus, where the punishment for apostasy from the Law of Moses is death! But if we accept that, then all of us here must also stand guilty of apostasy! We eat pork, meat forbidden Jews! We are thus guilty of transgressing the Law of Moses! Our answer is found in St. Paul. The Law of Moses is the old covenant, while we by our acceptance of our blessed savior are under the new covenant. St. Paul makes it abundantly clear, either we accept the new covenant, and put aside the laws of Moses, or we abide by the laws of Moses, and perish in our righteousness, having forsaken our salvation!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There were murmurs at this. Puritans took as an article of faith that they should abide by the covenant with god, but many of them assumed that meant everything in the Old Testament as well. Cromwell spoke more about the difference between the two covenants, and how he and the others had apportioned passages of the Old Testament. I had to admire him, once he was convinced of his original error and how to correct it, he doggedly pursued his quarry until he caught it. He spoke with fire, he spoke with eloquence, quite unlike his usual thin carping voice.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "As you can see, many of us have mistakenly believed that we were obeying Jehovah's word when we were perverting the words of our savior to follow the old covenant. We have allowed Satan to tempt us away from following the words of Jesus. Jesus taught compassion and forgiveness, but we have shown little compassion in our dealings with those who do not follow the puritan way. Instead we have killed, breaking the sixth commandment, and we have rewarded those who give false witness against their neighbor, breaking the ninth and the tenth."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He paused for breath, surveyed those in front of him. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions! We must mend our ways! We must right the wrongs we have done in god's name. We have behaved no better than the King of Spain with his inquisition! How many of you would want to be thought worse Christians than Spanish Catholics?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He was their leader, and now I could see why. He had most of them in the palm of his hand. Many of the religious objections they had raised to the agreement were rubbed off the board.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 They broke late that evening, without finishing their debate. Imladril asked the rest of us to join her for a night cap before retiring. She turned and offered her arm to Charles. "Perhaps you would care to joins us your majesty?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles accepted, but smiled deprecatingly "Thank you your majesty, you are most kind. I trust I am not intruding?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Of course not Charles, I am inviting you. We need to talk about today's events."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We headed up a flight of stairs, and along a draughty corridor. Durathror conjured floating lights to light our way. Charles commented "I should not let any of the puritans see you do that. You would be condemned for witchcraft."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled a dangerous smile. "These puritans play at piety, with no understanding. Cromwell and a few others are good men lead astray, but many more are thoroughly evil men trying to appear good. Power comes from god, not the devil. The devil has only the power to tempt us and lead us astray. The devil exists and operates only on god's sufferance. These puritans serve the devil under the pretence of serving god. Should they cross me, I shall make an example of them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We entered the suite and seated ourselves around the sitting room. Prospero commented to our group "It is encouraging, but it could be days or even weeks before they finish."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik smiled sourly "It is these interminable debates that I have no stomach for. Give me a battlefield any day! There were many times tonight I longed to bang a few heads together. I think there are a few necks there that could benefit from stretching too!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles smiled and nodded "I agree, king Amrik. There are several persons there who would benefit from the headsman's axe. They seek nothing less than the destruction of England. Many of the rest are ignorant ratbags."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero chuckled. "Gross ignorance - one hundred and forty four politicians!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril and Iskandor fetched wines, juices and delicacies from a dozen shadows. Both Charles' and Rupert's eyes bugged out as the viands appeared on the table.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril waved at the food. "Please help yourselves. We Viharani do not use servants. We do not believe anyone should serve another." We helped ourselves to the food and drink. Rupert poured for Charles.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril continued "Charles, Rupert, we show you this to demonstrate that we have powers the puritans could not guess at. I agree with my brother, if they attempt to cross us, we will be forced to deal with them in such a manner that they will never think to try again."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert asked "Your majesty, could you\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u224\'E0" he stopped, corrected himself. "I mean Imladril, could your powers deal with the army camped outside? There are perhaps five hundred or a thousand soldiers there."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril smiled. "Yes, here we are informal, so please do not use titles to us. Durathror and Iskandor have already dealt with the army." She looked at her brother.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "The army has packed up and returned to its barracks in London. It would appear they have no further reason for being here."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But surely their commander the Earl of Argyll would not order their retreat?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror tapped the side of his nose and winked. "Like I said Rupert, their commander issued orders for them all to return to barracks. This they have done. Had he tried to order them to attack, he would have found himself unable to utter the words."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles looked at them with a calculating expression. "And if the army decided to attack at dawn? Without their commander's orders?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror was still smiling. "Should they try that they will find themselves beset by such terror that they will fling away their weapons and flee for their lives. You saw what we did to those soldiers we passed on the way here."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril changed the topic. "How do each of you feel the discussion is going? Will the parliament ratify the agreement between Charles and Cromwell?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles spoke first. "I much fear that the parliament will balk at my restoration. Many there were clamoring for my head only a month ago. Even Danny has threatened that he will put my son on the throne in my stead. Are your interests mine?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror responded "Our interests are our own. To be honest Charles, you are not the best of kings, you are arrogant, autocratic and despotic, while at the same time given to sudden changes of mind and acting on whims without thought for the consequences. However, your son is young, and would be a weak king, easily bent to Cromwell's will. I believe that you have it within you to be a great king, if you will be guided for the nonce. There is the agreement, negotiated between you and Cromwell, which would restore you to the throne, and at the same time curb the powers of the monarch and the parliament. As far as we are concerned, we are here to ensure that the agreement is ratified without change, and ratified wholeheartedly. Only thus will lasting peace be restored to England. You could be remembered for centuries to come as an enlightened king like Queen Elizabeth is remembered. As it is, you are more likely to be like the Roman Emperor Nero, as the king who fiddled while England burned, and then lost his head. You could be a great king, but if you would be king, you must support this agreement wholeheartedly. You have been less than enthusiastic so far."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles looked around the room. He looked sad, but thoughtful. "Queen Elizabeth is remembered as a good queen, though she was ruthless in suppressing opposition. I too tried to suppress opposition who would overthrow me, but with less success. I learned my kingship from my father, among other things I learned to trust no courtier or noble, that everyone sought to curry favor from me, that all would flatter me to my face, but would happily stab me in the back behind my back."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He paused to drink some coffee. "I believe I have seen much in the past five weeks to teach me how to be a better king. I am not king Amrik, but I have seen how he rules, and this agreement would set up a similar system to that. But in addition, for the first time in my life I have met a group of people who treat me as a friend and an equal, who show me no deference to my royal status. You might note I have dropped the royal "we" when I am among you." He smiled.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero commented "I had been wondering why you often used "we" to refer to yourself. I put it down to my faulty understanding of English."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles explained that it came from the bible, where god appeared to refer to himself as plural, as in "Let us make man..." and added "and so we monarchs have become accustomed to referring to ourselves as "we" rather than "I".}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror chuckled and shook his head. "Some other time perhaps Danny and I might explain that those old testament passages are not quite what they may appear to be in English. But for tonight, the important question is whether you will fully support the agreement, and argue for it in the parliament. If you cannot support it, and continue to support it once we depart, then come two or three months and the parliament will depose you again."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles smiled ruefully "I had hoped to negotiate a better deal for myself. Can you not simply compel the puritans to support the agreement?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror laughed. "We could, and we could compel you to accept it also, but tomorrow the compulsion would wear off. There is no lasting hope unless both you and Cromwell willingly support it. God has given all of us free will. You have your agreement, I am sure Cromwell will argue for you with parliament, provided you also do your part."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik added forcefully "You are a man who would be king. You above all men should be a man of your word! You gave your word over this agreement, now you must keep it!" He stabbed his finger onto the table with a resounding thump.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero added "It is often said of politics that it is the art of lying with a straight face. The main reasons why governments have so many problems is that the people who govern go back on their words, and show favoritism."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles looked around at us. "Will you all give me your words that you will support this agreement also? Lord Danny, will you support me and not my son?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I smiled at Charles "My threat to you was in terms of if you did not support the agreement. I stand by what I said then. If you support and ratify the agreement, then I will support your restoration. Your son shall become king in the normal manner. If you refuse to support the agreement, then what choice to you leave anyone? Cromwell is only bound to support the agreement as long as you support it. He has been arguing for your restoration. Parliament would find it much easier to support your son." I shrugged.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Then I found the words I had been looking for. I looked him in the eye "This is your chance to be a great king, like Henry the eighth and Elizabeth. This is your chance to make England a just and free land, where all may prosper. For too long people have suffered under despotic kings who taxed them into the ground, and religious fanatics who tortured and killed them for their beliefs. England needs prosperity, England needs religious freedom, England needs a just and good king. I believe you can be that king, if you but choose to be."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The others echoed my sentiments. Charles tugged on his beard thoughtfully. He nodded. "I thank you for your statements of support. I will support the agreement to parliament, and try to present a united front with Cromwell. I believe that he is a man of his word, prickly though he might be. I just pray that we can win over the rest of parliament."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0  That night in dreaming, Nalini and I met as usual at the street of cafes in the university town. Durathror and Ra'anor were waiting for us, as was Paula. Ra'anor looked quite barbaric with her leathers, her tattoos and her wild red hair.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Hi guys!" Paula greeted us. "Prospero should be along soon." She was eating a brightly colored sundae, something she never eats in waking.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "Tonight we will take you to a place where Imladril and I often meet up. We'll wait for Prospero though."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We nodded, and ordered coffees from the hovering waiter. He had no aura, indicating he was a dreaming construct, a virtual person if you will, programmed to function as a waiter here. He seemed in his mid twenties, with Latin features, dressed in black trousers and immaculate white shirt. On his head was a straw boater with red green and white ribbons around the crown.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 As a dreaming construct, he was incapable of independent thought or free will. I thought about virtual persons I might create using a computer. While I wasn't an expert, I do understand the basics of doing this, I understand programming, and I understand computers. But what supplied the program and processor for this construct? What motivated it?}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini caught my thought, as she often does. "Maybe Durathror knows? I understand how inanimate objects are created. This table is a construct, it's just formed out of the dreaming stuff. But it doesn't have to do anything other than be a table. It doesn't have to react to us. But I don't know about how the waiter works. Do you Durathror?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled a perplexed smile. "We complain that the old sorcerers do without understanding how they do. I have never given the doing of the waiter much thought. You visualize what you want to create, you know how a waiter should behave, and that sets the pattern. It is our personal power that keeps the waiter as he is. The combined personal power of everyone here is hooked into the doing of this place. It is hard to over-ride that. But it is incorrect to think of the waiter as a person, he does not have a soul, unlike us."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You've heard of the Turing test haven't you?" He shook his head. I explained "That's where you are screened in a room, and communicate via a computer screen with someone in another room. You don't know whether the person in the other room is a real person or a computer construct. If you can't tell the difference, then is that person "real" even if it is a computer? Erm... I think I've answered my question."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror spoke slowly, thinking. "If it has a soul, then it is capable of free will, and independent action, and has some form of self awareness. If it has no soul, then it is a construct, it can never behave outside the mould that made it, and it has no self awareness. I have some familiarity with computers, but I am not sure I understand your question."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini commented "I understand Danny's question. We'll have to show you some of the computer agents in my home shadow. Many of them can pass the Turing test, what we are wondering is whether they have a soul. But both of us understand the basics of creating these agents, neither of us understand how the waiter can speak and respond to us with no computer behind it to give it life."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror nodded. "It is a construct. It hooks into your memories. If you ask it questions, it will answer from your experience. If I ask it, it will answer from my experience. It can never tell me something I do not know, unless there is a group of us around it, in which case it can pick anyone's mind for information."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But a computer construct has a processor to execute the instructions. What performs that function in the waiter?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Liz arrived, holding a confused looking Rupert by the hand. "Hey everyone, I managed to find him this time!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror took Rupert by the other hand, and held it for a few moments. Rupert brightened visibly, then started as if waking up. He looked around, then commented "I'm dreaming, aren't I?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We assured him this was the case. He smiled, settled himself into a chair beside Liz. The waiter hovered, and he turned to ask what was on offer. The waiter handed him a menu.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror turned back to Nalini and me. "I can't answer that question. The waiter is a construct, constructed from the stuff of dreaming. Call it the mind of god if you will."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What are you people talking about?" Liz asked. We explained as best we could.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 She looked at the waiter and shrugged. "So he's not a real person, he's like a robot. That's cool. How can you tell?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert was placing his order. Durathror said simply "He looks the same as he would in waking, he has no aura. We all have auras, though you may not be able to see that yet."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Liz looked around us, then made a rueful expression. "I guess I can't see them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The waiter moved away, Rupert turned to us. "What was that about the waiter not being real?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh, he's real" Durathror responded "but he is a dreaming construct, made by our collective wills and imagination. He has no soul, he is incapable of free will, he does not know he exists. He is no more than this table or these chairs."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert sat digesting this for a time. Finally he commented "Do you mean he is like a demon?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The waiter returned bearing a tray, deposited coffee and chocolate cake for Liz, beer and apple strudel for Rupert.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "No, what you would call a demon has a soul, and so possesses self awareness and free will. The angels do also, for how else could Lucifer have rebelled against god unless he had free will?" Durathror grinned. "The waiter is like a painting, except a painting that can move and behave in certain ways. We were discussing how he could move and react, but none of us know the answer to that."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert nodded, then looked puzzled. "I have not thought about this world of dreaming much, except that I have considered it to be as real as waking. I just assumed that everyone here was alive, like back home." He drank some beer, then remarked "Hey! This is real German beer! It's much nicer than English beer. And this strudel is just like the ones we make back in Germany!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled. "Here you can taste anything you can conceive of. But you can never taste something that you haven't tasted in waking. You don't have taste buds, you are experiencing the memory of how German beer should taste." That set them off into an explanation of how things in the dreaming realm could be changed to match our wills.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero arrived while this was happening, decided to try what Rupert was having, and then was disappointed when he realized that he couldn't experience the real taste, only his conception of what it might taste like. "Rupert, one day, you will have to treat me to real German beer and German strudel."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "When you do, I'd like to be invited as well."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I am most happy to do so." Rupert looked at us and remarked candidly "I take it this means you people intend to remain in contact with me once this affair is over?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Of course!" Liz exclaimed. "Erm, I mean, I can't shadow shift, I'll have to rely on the others."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled impishly. "Ah ha!" He twirled his moustache. "If young Rupert can prove himself capable, then it is possible that you and he might both learn the art of shadow shifting. It would be good for the two of you to practice together. We shall be returning to his home shadow from time to time, so if you are willing, Rupert, we will remain in contact. If young Liz is willing, we will bring her along when we can."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He looked at them, Rupert looked at Liz. "My lady, will you visit me from time to time?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "If they'll bring me, sure!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert almost sighed. "Then I am content." He grinned suddenly. "It seems I have incentive to learn the art of shadow walking."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Ra'anor had a motherly look on her face. "And so you should. Liz needs someone of a similar skill level to train with, and so will you. We'll make sure you get to see each other while you are training."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You'll have to visit us too" Nalini cut in. "Our home shadow is quite different from the one you're used to, but Prospero adapted, so I'm sure you'll cope."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Liz looked a little stricken. "I hope he won't be disappointed." she said softly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini commented "Liz, you are who you are, and Rupert just has to accept you as you are. That is the mark of friendship. It will take a while for the two of you to get to know one another properly, so do not rush things."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "And do not have too many expectations of one another." I continued. "When you have expectations you force the other into a mould they do not fit, and this leads to disappointment."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Sage words." Durathror commented, while Rupert and Liz both nodded. "Prince Rupert, you should know that there will be those who would condemn you as a sorcerer should we teach you. You may also find that eventually you move away from your home shadow to somewhere more enlightened."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert nodded, shrugged. "I may be a prince, but I have no lands and no kingdom unless both my older brothers die. I came to England and the court of my cousin to broaden my mind. Little did I realize that events would turn the way they have. I have a yen to travel. I had thought that when this civil war was over, I might visit the Americas. Now I know there are other earths to visit I should like to visit them as well. I no longer feel that I have a home here in England, nor for that matter in Germany."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero commented "Travel broadens the mind right enough. I met Paula, and learned that there was a whole new world out there waiting for me, and a wondrous one at that." His eyes were sparkling. "There are dangers, but a soldier needs some danger from time to time, otherwise he grows stale. I am sure you will not regret it."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert smiled. "I do want to see my children grow up. There was a time just before you rescued me when I feared I might not live long enough to sire any. I should like to learn, and I should like to remain friends with you all."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then let us drink to that." Durathror announced. Goblets of wine appeared on the table. He lifted the one closest to him and held it in the air. The rest of us picked up ours, we clinked them together, then drank. The goblets were blued glass decorated with gold, the wine in them blood red and sweet like port. Of course, this was my version of its taste.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We sat and talked a little while, until Durathror announced "They have returned. It is time for us to leave here."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Where are we going?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "To a place where Imladril and I like to meet." He stood, taking Ra'anor's hand. "Could all of you please take hold of one of us?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 As we did so, he explained to Rupert "How we travel in the world of dreaming is the same as shadow walking, except it is easier for us here. You can travel anywhere you can imagine, but it is difficult to go anywhere you have not been before. If I described where we are going to Danny, Nalini, Paula and Prospero, and asked them to make their own way there, none would arrive, though they would each reach a different place that resembles my description."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Four different places likely" Ra'anor interrupted. "They'd each have their own idea, and that's where they'd go. We have to take you there the first time, then you can find your way back there."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror added "You can picture a place, or you can picture an individual, and you will travel to that place, or to where the individual is. Let's go."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was a slight churning sensation in the solar plexus, and we were there. As Durathror remarked, the same powers are involved in shadow shifting, which is why it is taught in dreaming first. Anyone can learn to do it there, and having learned, can develop the necessary energies to perform the same feat in the physical world.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We arrived floating in the air above a large wooden platform attached to the trunk of an enormous tree. The sky was many shades of blue, and looked as if it has been painted in watercolors on wet paper. Our tree soared over the forest canopy that stretched beneath us, a carpet of dark green. The tree was one of the huge trees in which the Viharani made their homes. We were perhaps three hundred meters off the ground, and the trunk here was at least ten or fifteen meters in diameter. The tree stretched up into the heavens easily another two hundred meters. The trunk itself was hollowed out into rooms, one above the other something like a light house. A number of similar trees stood around at irregular distances. Their branches were thick but sparse, and covered with broad green leaves. Their colors were vibrant, full of life.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The vista sloped gradually up behind us. Before us, the canopy parted to reveal a large lake of sapphire blue, ringed on the further side by a range of snow capped mountains. To the left water spewed forth from one of the high peaks, a distant torrent of noise, foaming white, that tumbled into the lake from a height many times that of our vantage point. The shores of the lake were a riot of brilliantly colored flowers.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 On the platform with us were Imladril and Iskandor, accompanied by King Charles, Cromwell, Matthew, Lord Argyl and several other puritans. They were seated around a wooden table, talking animatedly. We were hovering, and I remembered something durathror had said about levitation was a skill that the viharani learned almost before they could walk. Perhaps one day Nalini and I would master that particular skill.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We alighted on the platform. Durathror swept his arm around "It is a wondrous view, is it not? Regard it well, that you may return here of your own volition." His English sounded slightly archaic, and I thought he had been spending too much time in contact with the English.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell looked around at us and smiled. It didn't make him look any prettier, showing his gapped and yellowed teeth. "The view is magnificent, is it not? My greetings and felicitations to all you lords and ladies." He seemed quite happy.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero returned "Greetings and felicitations to you all in return. You seem rather happy today Lord Cromwell, or should that be tonight?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I know that I dream, and yet you all are here with me. I had often thought that dreams were more than imagination, more than a mere theater of the sleeping mind. Tonight I have seen and understood that my soul is not confined to my body, but may roam whene're I sleep. Her majesty queen Imladril has conducted us on a tour of this realm, and we have met many who have died. Truly did out lord Jesus say "In my father's house there are many mansions."..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Matthew interrupted "We had always thought that it should read more like "My father's house has many rooms..." for how can a house have many houses, unless it refers to noble houses?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "...But now we know that this realm of dreams is the kingdom of god" Cromwell continued, only to be interrupted by Matthew again.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "And so is a mansion or house by simile, but each... er... I cannot call each place we visited a house, can I?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell harrumphed "Each locale we visited is an abode of the dead, and not all are dead in Christ. I never liked the idea that a compassionate god would condemn to hell all those who died before Christ was born, or who never heard of our blessed savior. But each abode is properly a house or mansion, so Jesus spoke truly when he said his father's house has many mansions." His eyes lit up. "I found my father and my grand mother! I found the dog I had loved as a child! It always troubled me that Rufus did not have a soul, and so should have perished utterly." The others were nodding. They too had met loved ones who had died.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Every living thing has a soul." Durathror observed. "That soul does not die. It comes from god's kingdom, and when the body dies it passes back whence it came."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "God marks the flight of the sparrow. Every living thing is important to him." I added, getting a feel for what had happened. Imladril had arranged for the puritans to have a religious experience that would help them stick with their new found compassion. All the puritans nodded at my words and those of Durathror.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The table grew larger to accommodate the rest us, and more chairs appeared. We seated ourselves and joined the conversation. Charles and Cromwell both seemed quite friendly toward one another, unlike when they were awake. They were engrossed in a discussion of the theological implications of what they had seen.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Matthew was declaring loudly that the good news should be proclaimed from the rooftops, and that puritans across the land would welcome the news.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell, being more politically astute, responded "This good news might cause alarm to some of our less enlightened brethren. It must be couched in terms innocuous enough that it does not affront our supporters, yet the detail must be there for those who know."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I grinned "Would you speak in parables Lord Cromwell? Give spiritual milk to spiritual babes, and spiritual meat to those who are more mature?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell nodded. "I begin to appreciate Jesus' dilemma. He spoke in terms that would seem innocuous enough to pass by most listeners ears, but those who have ears would hear his true words. I wonder what else is hidden within his parables and other words, hidden yet by our ignorance. It has now dawned on me why you and the Viharani eat no flesh."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles asked "Cromwell, something in your reasoning has passed over my head. How does what we have seen this night imply they should eat no meat?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A smile played across Cromwell's lips. "Because your majesty, what we have seen shows us that animals such as cows an pigs and chickens and dogs and cats also have souls. If they have souls, then it may well be a sin to kill them for food. Or rather not so much a sin as undesirable, something that a crude and unspiritual man might do because he knows no better, but something from which someone who knows better should refrain."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "The perils of knowledge, Lord Cromwell. When you know no better, you may be excused for performing some action. But once you have been shown, then you can no longer be excused."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But surely ignorance is no excuse!" Matthew interjected. "Certainly we do not allow ignorance of the law to excuse its breaking."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell shook his head. "Even our lord himself, when nailed to the cross, asked "Father forgive them for they know not what they do." Ignorance is an excuse, but the burden is upon those of us who do know better to set an example to the ignorant, and teach them when they are ready to learn. A man who will not learn, who turns his face away from the truth and the light, such a man may be condemned in his ignorance."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "You English know the truth, but consider that your followers will not understand yet. You must set the example to the others, you can no longer claim ignorance as an excuse." The puritans nodded at this. Durathror observed cynically "However, there is no pressing need for any others to know just yet. Especially since right now to declare truths such as animals have souls might cause you to be considered heretics. Instead, consider who understands well enough to share this, and we will show the truth to them as well. There is no need to rush this, rather take it steadily."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell nodded approvingly. Matthew griped "I still mislike the idea that we cannot proclaim the truth..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But Jesus spoke in parables for just that reason." I interjected.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Matthew nodded thoughtfully. "Yes, "He who hath ears, let him hear." We had always thought the same truth should be given to all, but if the lord Jesus saw fit to hide some truths from the masses, then perhaps we should do well to emulate him."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles commented "I mislike the idea of giving up meat. What is there to eat?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril smiled "Your majesty, do not attempt to do everything at once, or you will fail. Instead start gradually, and commence with eating less meat at a meal, and perhaps some meals without meat. But I think your chefs will need some instruction on how to prepare nourishing and delicious food that does not include meat. We can help there."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror added "My sister is right. Being spiritual should not be an onerous task. You have ingrained habits of a lifetime to break, and not all of you will be able to break them at once. God will be much happier if you start small, and advance slowly in the right direction, instead of bounding off rapidly, only to slide back all the time."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The king nodded. "It hath sense. Often backsliding causes one to fall even further than one's starting point, so nothing has been gained, and much has been lost."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell commented "It goes against the grain for me. When god has seen fit to vouchsafe me a truth, then must I pursue it with all my ardor. I cannot accept less from myself. But I think we should extend compassion to our brethren, and allow that if they set foot upon the path, then they need not follow it as swiftly as I. I find I must agree with you prince Durathror, that backsliding is to be avoided at all costs, even if it means proceeding more slowly than we might wish."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "God will never give you a burden to heavy to carry." I observed. "He sees into all our hearts, so as long as we do our best, he will be happy for each of us to proceed at our own pace."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You realize" Cromwell intoned, "that those words have implications of their own. There are many implications also in discovering that those who knew not Christ have not been condemned, but that their souls continue in the hereafter. Consider also..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 At this point our discussion was interrupted. One of the guides, a two meter high truncated telegraph pole, materialized beside Imladril. <<May I have your attention.>> There was no voice, the words echoed directly inside my mind. <<Assassins and <impression of orange spiky balls> are making an attempt on the lives of some of you right now.>> Durathror winked out, followed an eyeblink later by Imladril, and about two blinks later again by Iskandor. It was not possible for the guide to show any expression, but it sounded a little flummoxed. <<Oh\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u224\'E0 er\u224\'E0 perhaps the rest of you could follow me?>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We gathered everyone else together. There was some consternation, but Cromwell merely shrugged. "I have seen enough tonight that I no longer fear death. However, I take it that Prince Durathror has the matter in hand?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "He and Imladril should be more than a match for any assassins even when those assassins have assistance from non physical beings." She checked that all of us were touching her or the guide, and then said "Let's go."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I, plus Prospero and Paula, did not need to hold on, but we did so as to be sure of arriving in the same place as the others. We arrived in our bedroom, hovering above our bodies sleeping in the bed. Two dark figures crouched by the window. There seemed something wrong with their bodies, as if they weren't quite human. I noted each body had a cord of light indicating that their dreaming bodies were elsewhere.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Ra'anor announced "We stay here for now. The attackers are being rounded up."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I glanced at our sleeping bodies. Nalini was lying with one arm across my chest, her head half buried in the pillow. Our legs were entangled under the blankets. I felt a pang of love throb through me. The dreaming Nalini hovering beside me brought the back of my hand to her lips and kissed it.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Several of the others gathered around the unmoving figures crouched by the window. For some reason their details were not clear, as if there was a concealing spell about them.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They have an invisibility spell on them." Durathror remarked when he returned a few minutes later. "There are six we believe. Two here, one more in king Charles' chamber, another in Cromwell's, one was found outside Prospero and Paula's room, and the sixth in Matthew's room. For the nonce I would suggest you not awaken, you will see things more clearly in this state. Iskandor is checking for others."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What of the orange sea urchins things?" Nalini asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "My sister has them in our net, we will deal with them in a few moments."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Are the assassins still alive?" Paula asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Yes, though they are paralyzed and unconscious. You see those objects over there, the ones that look like a squid made of smoke?" he gestured toward the center of the room, where two smoky shapes that resembled tubular bodies with tentacles hovered. They were surrounded by a golden glow.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You've imprisoned them?" I observed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Yes" Durathror nodded. "We wish to interrogate all of them. Ra'anor, do you take our guests to Imladril, I will follow with our prisoners."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 She began shepherding all of us together. Cromwell was staring at the two of us hovering nearby, then at our physical bodies, and back again. "That line of light you see is what tethers us to our physical bodies." I remarked. "That is how you know whether something that appears to you in dreaming has a sleeping body somewhere."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He nodded, remarking "It is a little unnerving to see you lying there as well as standing here. I am not used to these things."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Perish the thought Cromwell, but if things keep going on the way they are, you might just become used to these sort of sights."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I take it the evil one is bent on our destruction? I will fight him to my last breath!" he declared fervently.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Someone or something is. I think we must wait until they have been interrogated."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Ra'anor led us not to the platform high among the trees, but to a place pink gravel and bone white bushes with spiny leaves. Nearby was a huge crystalline formation striated from layers of different colored crystals. Imladril was standing nearby, with a golden net in which seven orange spiky balls bounced around like mad, making sizzling noises.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Ra'anor explained "This is the dreaming analogue of a place of power. We might need some assistance."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril gestured. "All of you, form a circle around me, about five meters away from me." We did as we were bid. It wasn't until then that I noticed two guides beside the net, and there seemed to be some form of energy exchange going on between the guides and the orange balls.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror and Iskandor arrived a minute later, bearing between them another golden net with six of the squid like beings. These ones had lines of light, tethering them back to their bodies.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The interrogation was necessarily difficult since none of the beings possessed human thought patterns. The squid like beings remained haughtily defiant. They issued a single statement that might be paraphrased as <<Two legged demonspawn! Loathsome poisonous creatures, polluting world! Sacred duty is kill all!>> Their other thought patterns seemed to be mainly a jumble of images.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 One of the guides explained <<To them, you are evil creatures that their god has condemned to be destroyed. They revile your gods as demons. They otherwise offer threats and defiance.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That's a bit steep!" Charles exclaimed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Matthew was somewhat harsher. "They are fiends themselves!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "We should not make threats. I wish to find out more about what they are doing and why." He turned back to the guide. "What was their purpose when we apprehended them?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<They sought to kill you all. They have been cloaked with an invisibility spell, and they bear poisoned fangs. One drop on the skin should be sufficient to kill a human.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Who provided them with the invisibility spell?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The guide was silent for a few moments, but we could sense a buzzing of thoughts. <<They say they were brought there by <image of spiky orange balls>. They believe they will be rewarded should they die performing their duty.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That is all? What can you add guide? Do they speak the truth?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<In that they are like humans. They possess the ability to lie. However, I detect nothing to indicate they are lying.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Can you think of any reason why we should not simply return them whence they came?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Moving their physical bodies such a distance will be quite a drain. We will need your power to assist us.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled and nodded. "Can they return, or do they need assistance? How did they get there in the first place?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The guide was silent again for a time. <<Their god moved them. They cannot return unless their god moves them again.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I realized by now that the guide would always answer a question truthfully, but would not volunteer information unless it was specifically requested. Durathror twirled his moustache thoughtfully. "Tell us what you can of their god. Ask them what they know that you do not. How dangerous is their god to us? Why are they attacking us? What are they trying to achieve? Guide, find out everything you can from them, then tell us."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<This may take a little while.>> The guide hovered there silently.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror turned to the two guides hovering near the spiky orange balls, hissing and spitting inside their golden web. "What can you tell me of these?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<These are non corporeal beings from the fourth great band. They are quite inimical to humans, and to our kind as well. Were it not for their restraints, they would attempt to drain all of us. There are some here who are more susceptible to that.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What is the fourth great band? Why are they inimical to us?" Rupert asked. Nalini and I thought a few more questions as the guide replied, which it picked up on as it replied.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<The great bands are analogous to the seven colors you perceive>> one of the guides began. <<The human band is like the color red. All humans possess this color, most can never venture outside their band, their life force simply dissolves away. Where we are now is part of the human band, albeit it at the side closest to the band that belongs to <image of orange spiky balls>. To the best of our knowledge, there are forty nine great bands, but only seven are available to humans, and only one is their home. We are from another band that is accessible to humans. The <image of orange spiky balls> are from a band that is not accessible to humans except under extraordinary circumstances, and even then only for a short time. Danny and Nalini were drawn into that band and almost dissolved. We do not understand how they escaped, since their energy levels are such that they should have been trapped...>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What do you mean by dissolved?" Rupert interrupted.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Their life force is drawn from their spirits, and consumed by the <image of orange spiky balls>. They cease to exist. Complete and utter annihilation.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell quoted ""Do not fear death, but fear those who can destroy your immortal soul" I had thought that was poetic, and that only god himself has the power to destroy souls. What manner of beings are these then?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<They do not fit your theological view of the world. They are not demons as you would have them, but powerful beings in their own band. Out of their band, they have much less power. They are predatory beings. To them you are prey...>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Like wolves you mean?" one of the puritans asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<The wolf kills to live. Do you regard the wolf as a demon? It has as much right to live as do you humans. The universe is a predatory world, where many being hunt down others. Beings from outside the human bands are inimical to humans by their very nature. Your energies attract predators, they seek you out to prey on you.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We do not deny the wolf the right to live" Cromwell observed "but rather when they attack our farms and villages we hunt them down and kill them. These" his finger stabbed in the direction of the orange balls in their net of gold "have crossed into our England, and hunt us. This we cannot allow!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "True" Durathror responded. "But I seek to find out why they hunt us. This is no mere foray into the human realms. There is intelligence and purpose behind it. Guide, I know about these beings, and about the predatory nature of the world. Do you ask them why they attack us, and what they seek to accomplish."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<They do not respond on this. They maintain that they are predators, we all are prey, and they do not have to explain their will to us. You will note that they include we guides with humans. However, we are more powerful than they are, we are in no danger. Might I just point out that we can protect all of you from beings like these, if you but say the word.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror shook his head. "Those of us you want have already made up their minds. The others have not the power, so do not tempt them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What is this?" Cromwell asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror explained "They can offer a place of safety in this predatory world, where no harm can befall us. But in return for that safety we must become their servants. Do not fear Cromwell, you do not have the power to attract them yet."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Do you mean serve as in human servants, or do you mean serve as in worshipping false gods?" Cromwell asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<We are not gods, we seek no worship.>> One of the guides responded. <<We have only your best interests at heart. We can offer you a place of safety in our realm, where none can harm you. But in return you must serve us. It is not onerous, your spirits will be free to explore the limits of existence, and discover knowledge.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What does this servitude involve?" Cromwell asked. "We'll have no truck with devils' pacts."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You would give up your free will." Durathror responded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then we should have nothing to do with these demons!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<We seek nothing from you, Cromwell, and we make you no offer. As Durathror explained, you do not have the power to be with us. We seek such as Durathror, Danny and Nalini, but they have so far refused our offers. We are not demons, we are incapable of harming you.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Cromwell, the guides are friendly, in their own way. They do offer a place of safety, but we believe the price is too high. They are not demons, they have worked in human history to help humans. You know them as angels."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Angels? They? But..." Cromwell began. The guide transformed into a beautiful androgynous angel, with white complexion, golden hair, and a white robe that was painful to look upon, so bright was it.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<As such we have appeared in your history from time to time. We never harm humans, we only help.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "And they have no free will. You should know this, lord Cromwell. They must do as god bids them. But everything is a test, or a lesson. And so when you are ready, you will be tested. However, this is side tracking us. I want to know why those beings tried to arrange our assassination."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Is there any way we can compel them to talk?" Rupert asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Torture works well on humans." Charles observed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<They are non corporeal beings, they cannot feel pain.>> one of the guides responded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I were thinking about the time when we were attacked, and how we escaped. We both agreed we tapped into something vast and powerful. Whether it lay somewhere among the forces that powered the gems, or whether it lay somewhere deep in our own bond, we did not know, though we felt it lay deep within our bond. We shifted our shapes into the eagle headed man and the jaguar headed woman. The hissing and spitting grew more virulent.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They know us" I said to the guide. "Find out why they know us, and why they fear us."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was silence from the guides for several minutes. Nalini and I linked minds, and tried to push our memories back to the time we had defeated our assailants. Somewhere deep within, under layers and layers, was some core that could tap into some vast power. However, this time it seemed to be eluding us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<You are the enemy. You summoned the eagle. You caused their compatriots to be unmade. They seek revenge.>> The guide paused}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We drove the link deeper, becoming two halves of some greater whole. Was it simply this? But still the feeling eluded us. It was there, out of reach, buried.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The guide continued <<They believe you two are manifestations of The Eagle and The Jaguar, beings from the primary pattern. Of this we can see no evidence, except that you escaped from their trap.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Yes, that had to be the key. We began feeling the touch of their energies, the small amount that leaked out through the net. That energy was like a jagged blade upon a wound, like a piercing shriek, like fingernails dragged upon a blackboard. We almost cringed in horror at that touch. But deep within, something cold and alien looked back, peering through deep layers. A shudder passed through us as that something rose toward the surface, taking control.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Stop! Do not!" Durathror thundered, but it was too late. The creatures swam before us, and some part of us was dimly aware we had somehow passed through the golden barrier. They swam around us, their energies was trying to flay the layers from us, to drain us and separate us, as they had before.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<We are one! No power may separate us!>> that was the other part of the key. The pain was hideous enough to make us cringe, but that was now only part of what we were. To the other part the pain was a sensation, a guarantee that we lived. That part reached out to caress the orange balls, even though it felt like caressing a naked flame. They fled to the edges of their prison, frantic in their efforts to avoid our touch. That part of us informed them <<You are my prey, mine for the taking, when I choose. Tell your master I know his name. These are under my protection.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 And then, like a sneeze, we retreated back amongst the others. The golden net and its contents winked out. Imladril stood looking directly at us, hands on hips, a shocked expression on her face. Durathror peered intently at both of us. He shook his head. "What are you two? I saw when you vanquished the serpent god, there was something else that came to the fore. Those entities must be correct, you have some private link to the Eagle and the Jaguar. But beware!" He shook his finger in our faces. "What you did just then was reckless in the extreme. Do not count on the Eagle to save you every time! You do not have my skills or my powers, and it will take you hundreds of years to develop them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril added "You could easily have been destroyed. That was like putting your arms into a tank with hungry sharks. I think we should explore this some other time, understand how it manifests, and what its limits are. Until we understand it, please keep it under control." She looked worried, as if she were a bit out of her depth by the events.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We nodded "We won't let it happen again, unless we're attacked." We both replied.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror commented "They may have been prompted by what ever worked through them. We must keep an eye on them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Just how did you make those beings vanish, and our net?" Imladril asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 That cold presence was gone, all that remained were memories of memories. "We don't know, it just sort of happened." Some thoughts popped into our minds. "The Serpent is behind tonight's attack. This is personal. It will not rest until we are destroyed. The Eagle has responded." We spoke together.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Hmmm. Be careful, it is a dangerous game you play. The more you draw attention to yourselves, the more you make it personal. The harder the Serpent tries, the more chance there is of something happening. We are not talking just physical death, we are talking the death of your souls. Very well, do you know whether they were the ones who tried to lead Cromwell and his friends astray earlier?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We didn't. Cromwell however nodded thoughtfully. "These are the demons who masqueraded as our savior, and tried to convince us to pollute England with their foul ideas!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The guide corrected him. <<These ones are not the ones who appeared before you. Those ones were unmade by the Eagle acting through Danny and Nalini. These seek to avenge that destruction. It does seem that the Serpent has arranged this attack. You two will not be safe from them unless you join us. All you need do is request that aloud.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Sorry, we value our free will. The Eagle has promised to keep an eye on us."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril sighed "Well brother, that has resolved what to do with those entities."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles asked "What are the Eagle and the Serpent? I take it you are not referring to animals. They sound positively pagan."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 One of the guides answered pedantically <<They are the two godforms of archetype that gives rise to our set of shadows. They are also referred to as order and chaos...>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Thank you guide." Durathror interrupted. I think Charles' eyes were glazing over. "I think I should try to put this in terms they are more familiar with. The Serpent you should all know from your bible, it is the same that tempted Adam. The Eagle is its counterpart, something higher than an arch angel. They are less powerful than god almighty, but they are very powerful. Both are barred from the world of shadows which we inhabit, their very presence would distort and destroy. Instead they work through agents, human and other. We work on the side of the Eagle."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That is comforting to know!" Cromwell exclaimed. "But why can they not appear in our world, when the bible contains accounts of arch angels visiting us?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You are referring to arch angels. These are higher than that."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Higher than arch angels?" Matthew exclaimed. "Are you sure?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They are definitely higher, though I am unsure what they might be called."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Archangels are pretty low in the scheme of things." I cut in. "I recall reading that there are ten known levels, with archangels being the third lowest. The top levels are called..." I paused for a moment, recalling. "Dominions, Powers and Principalities, and I think Principalities are the highest. The Serpent is known as the Prince of Darkness because he is a fallen Principality."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell commented "I believe blessed St Paul wrote that "we fight against principalities and powers"; that agrees with what you say. But what then is Michael? I am sure the bible refers to him as an archangel, yet he bested Lucifer and vanquished him from heaven."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I think that Michael was a commander in god's army, but not the commander in chief, and he did not personally beat Lucifer. Didn't Jesus say "I saw Lucifer fall like a meteor from the heavens"? I would guess that Jesus himself was the one who vanquished Lucifer. And didn't Gabriel tell Daniel that he and Michael were delayed by the Principality of Air?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell actually smiled as he nodded his agreement. "I think that popular wisdom is not always right. What you say makes more sense." He turned to the other puritans. "So my brethren, we fight against the devil himself and his minions! We must be very careful that we do what is right!" He spoke slowly, emphasizing each word.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror turned to the guide with the squid like beings. "What have you discovered?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Little you do not already know. They volunteered for what might be termed sacred duty, were briefed to kill all creatures they encountered, and delivered within a heartbeat to the corridors outside the rooms in which you were sleeping.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then let us return them to wherever they are from. Can you assist us in that? Their bodies must be transported, and then we can release their spirits. We will not kill them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<That is acceptable. You must remain here, and open the channels for us. My companions and I will perform the actual transportation.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror, Imladril and Iskandor moved to the crystal formation. Durathror explained to us "This is a power source to which all our torcs are linked. Or rather, it is the dreaming analogue of that power source. I am sure you understand that we do not need to be here to tap into the power from here, but the guides cannot tap into this unless they are here, and we open the channel for them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Um.. I thought the guides were pretty powerful, so why do they need to tap in here?" Paula asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They don't need to, they are perfectly capable of transporting those creatures home without assistance, but they won't expend their energy unless they are compensated. We do not possess sufficient power to journey to their realm, it would take us weeks of shifting if we wanted to walk there. That should tell you just how distant their realm is. Here we can supply the guides with the energies they want to transport these creatures themselves."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The three positioned themselves with their left hands on the crystal formation. At first nothing much seemed to be happening, but then I noticed swirls and vortexes forming on the outside of their auras. They extended their right hands, and a vortex formed just beyond each hand. The three guides positioned themselves inside these energy vortexes. The energy began to swirl around the black forms of the guides, flickering around them like flames.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Human auras are roughly egg shaped, and swirl with colors. Most humans have darkened colors reds, greens and grays. Sorcerers have brighter and clearer colors, and include yellows and blues. The guides on the other hand possess cylindrical auras of pale violet. The swirls of energy that were being channeled from the source were predominately blue-green, and formed a second cylinder around the outside of the guides' auras.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Suddenly the three guides winked out, although the energies were still being channeled into them - the streams seemed to stretch to infinity. A minute passed before the guides returned. They glided over to the golden web that surrounded the six smoky squid like forms, and seemed to absorb the gold. The freed spirits buzzed around like flies for a moment, then shot off into the distance.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 In unison, Durathror, Iskandor and Imladril clenched their right fists, and the flow of energy shut off. They removed their left hands from the crystal formation, and then proceeded to shake their hands like you do when you have pins and needles.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Well, that's that" Durathror announced. "I wonder how much you English will remember tomorrow."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0  The next morning Nalini and I felt a bit hung over - we had headaches, muscular and joint aches, and we felt woolly headed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It must be last night's little run in with those orange beings" Nalini opined.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I'm inclined to agree, but could it be flu? This place is terribly cold and draughty."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini shook her head. "I've been wearing my torc for almost twenty years. I stopped becoming sick after about the first six months. If it were only you who was sick, I'd say it was flu. See if you can fetch Fin's dagger." She was referring to the dagger given me by Fin mac Morn way back in my early shifting days. It had a gem in the hilt that tapped into some peculiar power sources, as did the gem in the ring she'd been given at the same time.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Fetching is similar to shadow shifting, except that instead of walking to where something is, you call it to you. It takes power, but fetching small items over short distances is easier than shifting, while fetching large items or over long distances is much harder than walking through shadow to them. The dagger was small, but quite distant, but since it had its own power source, it should be easier to fetch than almost anything else.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Except that this it proved quite difficult to contact it. I sat quietly, putting my aches and pains away from me, but finding it hard to sense through the cotton wool that seemed to surround me. Nalini had similar trouble with her ring, but after what seemed like ages it sat in the palm of her hand. It was a plain gold band set with a large faceted yellow gemstone. At first glance it looks to be colored glass, except that when you look into it, scintillating points of color swim within its depths.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 She put it on her right hand and placed my left hand on top. "Let me help lover."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I felt tingling warmth flowing up my left arm, and within seconds my head began to clear. I felt the dagger, and called it to me. The dagger sits in a worked sheath of black leather. It has a leaf shaped blade about twelve inches long and seems to be made of bronze, except that steel cannot scratch it. Its handle is horn, carved and bound with gold wire. The quillions are gold. In its pommel is set a large yellow gem, identical to that in Nalini's ring.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I left the dagger in its sheath, but held it in my right hand. Nalini took my right hand in her left. We went through the process of waking the lines of force, and let the energies flow into us and through us, from me to her and from her to me, circulating. Before the showdown with the Serpent there had been hundreds of lines of force, now there seemed to be only a few, but they were still sufficient. Our torcs don't seem to be able to give us the same pick up and healing that these gems can.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Eventually we felt our old selves again, and a little after that we washed, dressed and went downstairs for breakfast. Nalini wore her ring, I thrust my dagger into my boot.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 With so many guests, the palace had departed from the normal procedure of feeding guests in the smaller breakfast room, and instead had fitted out the main dining hall. Its tables were quite long, and could easily fifteen or twenty people.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Almost all the other guests were already there. The puritans occupied three tables, though Cromwell, the Earl of Argyll and Matthew sat with the Viharani. In a departure from his usual practice, king Charles was also there, at the head of a table with King Amrik, Queen Enyil, Prince Rupert, Liz, Prospero and Paula.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Paula grinned at us. "Gee, you two must have been having fun to be this late for breakfast." She was toying with some bread and jam.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh, I believe in starting the day with a bang!" Nalini quipped back. "Don't you?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Yeah, but Prospero likes his food more I think!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik guffawed "He likes them both! And food gives stamina for a repeat performance!" He was halfway through a huge plate of bacon, eggs, sausages, slices of toast, plus what looked like sour kraut and Polish style pickled cucumbers.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I find it works up an appetite!" I put in. "What's to eat?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You can order almost anything, though you may have to wait while the chef cooks it" Charles replied. His plate included mashed potato, a roasted bird of some kind, small enough for the entire bird to fit on the plate, as well as two pickled capsicums. There were more in a dish near by. A half eaten buttered bread roll sat on a side plate.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I thanked him, then added "I didn't think that England went in for sour kraut, pickled capsicums and Polskie ogorkie?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He raised an eyebrow, but responded "This is all my cousin Rupert's doing. He complained that honest English cooking lacked flavor, so he introduced some German staples. They have proved quite popular with some of my court."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini meanwhile was talking with a liveried waiter. "What have you to eat apart from meat and fried foods?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He ran through a list of things, many of them boiled.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Liz contributed "They even have kippers! I've always wondered what they were like, they're quite good! Especially with those gerkins." She gestured with her fork at a bowl of pickled cucumbers. On her plate were two brown things that looked a bit like leather soles, I guessed they were kippers, along with mashed potato and several cucumbers.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I'm vegetarian, remember? I try to avoid eating flesh." Nalini flashed Liz a grin. "Besides, kippers are salty, greasy and full of little bones. I can't stand them!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Liz nodded back, spoke through a mouthful of food. "Yeah, that's probably why I like them! What they need is some good fried potato chips instead of mashed potato though."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini shook her head. Rupert responded "If you know how to make fried potato chips, we could have a word to the chef, and have him make you some."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Not this time, but maybe after breakfast I can tell him."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero had several dishes of jam in front of him, as well as a dish of honey, another of curled butter shavings. "The bread and jam is rather good Nalini. If you want some protein, they have several good cheeses I can recommend."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini nodded. "I think I'll settle for a selection of cheeses, some mashed potato, and a salad if you have any fresh vegetables that can be eaten raw. Have the chef mix up several spoons of olive oil, half that of lemon juice, a pinch of salt and one clove of chopped garlic and pour that over the salad. I don't suppose you have any chilies do you?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "No ma'am, I don't think so, but I'll check."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It doesn't matter if you haven't. But if you do, have the chef slice a couple and put them in a side dish."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The waiter nodded, and turned to me. Nalini is more of a vegan than I am, I eat eggs, she doesn't. "Scrambled eggs - two eggs, half a cup of grated tasty cheese, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, you do have that don't you?" I knew they wouldn't have soy sauce. He nodded "and a small amount of fresh onion, capsicum and tomato. Mashed potato on the side thanks, and some toast."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini shook her head at me. "They'll fry that in lard you know. It's very unhealthy!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But it tastes good!" Amrik put in over a mouth full of food.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Are you saying the cheese is low fat? You'll probably have more fat in your cheese than I'll have in my eggs."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But at least mine won't be fried in lard! Yuck!" she made a face.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A few minutes later the chef came out to talk to the two of us about what we wanted, and what he could provide. Low fat cooking was not a concept he had heard of, though he correctly surmised that boiling would be lower in fat than frying in lard. They also did not have any olive oil, or edible oil of any kind, and salad was a foreign term. The chef was humbly apologetic about all this.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What ever happened to our French chefs?" Charles enquired.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 It seemed the chef hadn't noticed the king until then. The poor chef was almost beside himself with fright. He stammered and stuttered, and bobbed about in an agony of cringing. We waited patiently while he got his words out. "Th... th... the f... f... f... French sh... sh... sh... chefs all l.. l... left a... a... after... er... er..." his voice trailed off.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "After what man? Speak up." the king's voice was kindly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "After Cromwell, I mean the lord Protector er... er... you... sire." His voice was squeaky with embarrassment.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "After Cromwell had us arrested?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The chef's head nodded vigorously.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Very good, you may go." The chef fled back to the safety of the kitchen. Charles observed to the rest of us "We will have to set things in order as soon as our restoration is declared valid." He sighed, and dropped the royal 'we'. "I am impatient for this sorry affair to be finished, and to get on with the business of governing England. Dealing with parliament is so frustrating!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero responded "Not all of them have seen the error of their ways yet, but Prince Durathror has assured me that he will have them eating out of his hand before much longer."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I wish I possessed his powers" Charles replied. "Cromwell and his cronies are as stubborn as oxen and as dangerous as wild boar."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik chuckled. "We're bringing in a parliament to help me in dealing with the nobles. Many's the time I've felt the urge to shorten a few of their necks! With the new parliament in place, they will find the curb bit in their mouths."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles nodded. "I've felt the urge to remove a few heads from shoulders. It would make the others wondrously obedient." He smiled. "The new parliament will be less powerful than the old, but the monarch will also have fewer powers. I am not convinced it will all work."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik agreed. "It should stop situation like that which lead to your civil war from arising. But I have also decided to learn what the Viharani will teach me. You should probably do likewise."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Queen Imladril and Prince Durathror have promised to teach me, but I am not sure if I want to learn. Last night made me realize that such knowledge is dangerous."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I missed the fun and games. But consider this: those creatures were directing Cromwell and his friends. Without knowledge of sorcery you would now be dead. Once I swore I would have no truck with sorcerers, but I owe my life to Danny, Nalini and Durathror. I now believe it is like learning to use a sword. Certainly you can be killed or injured using one, but as a king you will be put in situations where you could be killed or injured if you do not have this knowledge. I speak now as one king to another: being king is dangerous, I believe we should take all steps we can to safeguard ourselves."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles stroked his beard. "Do not say the word sorcery in the hearing of any puritan, they will claim your head."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik grinned ferociously. "Then I will make them work for it! I am not called the Bull for nothing! The dogs would be gored and trampled."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I believe you, king Amrik. But now let me advise you: enough dogs can bring down the strongest bull or bear."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik grunted and smiled ruefully. "I take your point, king Charles."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles looked at Amrik for a long moment before he continued. He seemed to be thinking. "I am able to recall much of what transpired last night. I had forgotten those creatures were pulling Cromwell's strings like a puppet master. Incidents like this will continue to happen, whether I learn or not. That is a very apt analogy, king Amrik. I may not be the world's best swordsman, but I can give a good account of myself if I must. Just as it be prudent to learn the art of fencing, so it also be prudent to learn the arts and knowledge of the Viharani." He sighed and smiled. "Once I believed that god in his heaven ordered the world, and would look after my welfare as his representative on earth. Now I have learned that God helps those who help themselves. He may even have organized you to rescue me, and open my eyes to the plans of the evil one. I must ask Prince Durathror how we can protect ourselves from further occurrences."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil responded "Your majesty, what has happened here in recent years is like a festering sore. It must be opened, and the putrid flesh scraped out if it is to heal. Prince Durathror has excised much that is putrid, but we must continue to dig until we find the source of the disease, and remove that. He is sure that things will come to a head sometime in the next few days."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik gleamed wolfishly. "I chafe at sitting here waiting for something to happen. The prospect of action makes me happier!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles added "I pray that this is settled soon. One thing puzzles me though. I thought I understood where Cromwell and his cronies stood in this matter, but now I have discovered they are puppets dancing to someone else's tune. I find that threatening, especially since I do not understand what all these sinister creatures are about. Could one of you be so good as to explain things to me?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I think we all looked to Enyil. She smiled. "I will try to explain things, though I may not always be familiar with terms that you use. There are many non physical being about. By this I mean they do not posses a physical body like we do. A great many are like wild beasts or perhaps monkeys, they can cause trouble, but is a passing thing. Others however are more like humans, they have intelligence, they form intent, they plan and follow through. They are not demons, rather they are capable of both good and evil, it is an individual choice. Some, such as those orange puffballs, are antagonistic to humans, and seek to harm them. Do not you humans do the same with different nationalities and religions?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We are trying to move beyond that" I responded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil nodded. "I was referring to the situation here in England."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles answered "I must agree with earl Daniel. We are endeavoring to move beyond those base motives. However, the Spanish have a penchant for harming anyone who is not a catholic of the Spanish persuasion, and our puritans would perform the same service for any who are not of the puritan persuasion. But I take your point, these creatures are like humans, they form factions, and seek to harm those whom they regard as enemies."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil nodded again. "None of us are sure what they hoped to achieve with their influence of Cromwell, but that appears to be more organized than is usual. Those orange puffballs do not possess the power to shift physical objects through shadow without help. Durathror believes the first attack on Danny and Nalini is related to what ever they were doing with Cromwell and the other puritans. After all, we interrupted their plans. Last night appeared to involve the same group, although there is another shadowy presence implicated."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Is that the Serpent?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil looked at Nalini. "I will get to that. Durathror is sure that there is something sinister behind what happened with Cromwell and the other puritans. We know that there are groups of powerful entities who delight in causing pain and suffering to humans. Their modus operandi is to generate a fanatical following for some leader, and then use that following to destroy all who are different. The result is war, and genocide of all who are different. Once that has happened, the fanatics turn upon themselves and destroy one another. Sometimes the sinister being will incarnate to give better expression to its desires. Normally however, they are incapable of donning human flesh, and must work through human agents."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Would they be fallen angels, demigods or what? Would someone like Hitler be one of them, or a protege?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That's a good question Danny. Terms like gods, demigods, fallen angels, demons and the like are human terms, they do not adequately reflect what is out there. These beings are predatory, and humans are but one of their quarries. Hitler may have been an incarnated one, but more likely he was a prot_g_. These sinister beings would develop new Hitlers where ever they work their wills. Durathror has pledged to stop these beings where ever he encounters them. He will stop these ones too. Now this brings me to last night. These creatures don't often recognize individual humans, we all look the same to them. Cromwell and a few others are obviously the exception there. However, someone recognized Danny and Nalini, and set about doing something to stop you, and your companions."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It's the serpent behind it somehow. We knew that when we dealt with them last night."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil nodded slowly. "It's our guess that the serpent has some interest in the arrangement they made for Cromwell. We hope it is only slight, otherwise it could be difficult. You two made yourselves known to the serpent when you summoned the Eagle to deal with the beings that were trying to destroy you. If we keep both of you out of any action that arises, then you will drop from his view again. Durathror feels that the serpent will make another attempt soon, but if that is thwarted then he will lose interest."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "How do we achieve that? It sounds as if there is some danger."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 She gave a half smile. "We advise you two not to summon the Eagle unless you have no choice. The other matter is that if you open the links to the gems in your ring and dagger, you will make those gems known to interested beings. There are many who would seek to wrest them from you. But it works both ways. Others can track you, but so can the Eagle, so while you are calling attention to yourselves, you are also ensuring that the Eagle watches."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I looked at one another. We had a quick mental exchange, then we nodded, and closed down the links to our gems. I suppose it was like clearing the firing chamber of a gun: there would be extra steps required to ready it for use, but it was still a reassuring presence.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles asked "Is it dangerous for the rest of us? Those creatures were trying to assassinate me and several others."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It could be dangerous until we finish this. The thing to remember is that these creatures do not think like humans, they do not have human motives or human reactions. You and Cromwell are among those they have marked, and it appears they want you dead. Durathror has decided that there should always be one of the Viharani with those who are marked. We are much more capable of dealing with these threats. Other than that, life should go on as normal."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles actually managed a smile. "Well, we all must die, 'tis but a question of when and how. I will not go in fear, though an elfin bodyguard seems a sensible precaution. Does Cromwell know of this?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Durathror has been explaining things to the puritans this morning. We think they are only just realizing that in their terms they have made a deal with their devil. Once they are convinced of that, they will let nothing stop them from implementing your agreement. There is much harm they must also undo."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik added "We plan to leave the puritans to Durathror's tender mercies today and do some sight seeing. My attention span has a limit when it comes to parliamentary debate. I tend to tell them what I want, and to get back to me if they have any problems."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles laughed. "I tried that, and look where it got me!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Where were you planning on sightseeing?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh just around the city of London. Would any of you like to join us? I am sure it would be more fun with the rest of you."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We agreed, as did Prospero, Paula and Liz. Rupert said to Charles "With you permission, your majesty?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles waved his hand airily. "Go ahead. I am sure I can dispense with you company for the day."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Does this mean you're not coming with us?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles looked at Amrik in surprise. "My dear king Amrik, I should be recognized! I would like to come, but it is not possible."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil smiled at him. "King Charles, would you come if we could alter your appearance so that not even your mother could recognize you? Amrik does this all the time back home when he wants to escape the pressures of being king."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik added "I enjoy becoming an ordinary man and walking the streets incognito. Being a king is so stifling."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles stroked his beard in thought a moment, then replied "If you can render me unrecognizable, then I shall join you. I must confess the freedom I had while in Aquilonia has made me realize how circumscribed my life in England is."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0  And so it came to pass that we headed off to London an hour and a half later. Most of us were dressed for shadow walking, but minus our large packs. Nalini and I carried day packs instead. I wore my sword slung across my back, its hilt projecting over my right shoulder, my dagger in a sheath at my left hip and a pistol in a belt holster on my right. Nalini wore similar weapons, although her knife was plainer than mine. We tend to think alike these days. Paula wore only a gun and knife, she doesn't like swords. Liz at this stage had no real skill with weapons, though she had proven she could shoot. We let her wear a gun, and told her to wear a knife. Prospero wore his sword at his hip; he grew up wearing swords and does not find them awkward to wear at the hip. He also wore a gun on his right hip. Amrik wore his huge black broadsword at his hip, and a knife at his right hip. There were also a couple of daggers peeping from his boot tops. Enyil wore a long bladed knife and no other apparent weapons. All of us wore jerkins of ceramic mail underneath our outer clothing. Prince Rupert wore his saber, and was dressed as a gentleman-soldier. This meant richly but plainly. King Charles wore a rapier at his hip, and was dressed more as a gentleman with doublet and baggy trews. He wore knee high boots with bucket tops, and carried a cane with a silver knob. I thought he looked like one of the three musketeers.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We walked some distance away from the manor into some nearby woods before Enyil worked her magic on Rupert and Charles. We did not want any observers. She made Rupert's hair seem black instead of blond. His face was not too well known, we presumed he would not be identified. Charles however was well known, his head was on most coins. Enyil made his hair seem blond and curly with a touch of gray, and his face broader and less refined.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "How ever did you manage that!" Charles exclaimed as he studied himself in the mirror. "Is it permanent, or will I revert?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It is a simple illusion, your majesty, and will wear off within twelve hours if not renewed. There are no physical changes to your body, only to what people will see."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That is a relief, though now that I think upon it, it might be an advantage to be able to appear younger." He smiled.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Ah, the appearance of youth without the vigor to back it would soon pall, your majesty. Better for you to learn about power, and make yourself grow younger. However, if you wish to appear younger..." His image blurred briefly, when it came back into focus twenty years had dropped from his face.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Now that is truly miraculous!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "As I warned your majesty, you still have the mannerisms of a man of middle age, and your choice of words and their cadence will give you away to those who know. And do not forget that though you may look like a twenty year old, your body is still middle aged. If you walk the path of knowledge, you will knowledge is power, and power can restore your youth."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles' smile slipped slightly. "Many a man would sell his very soul to regain his youth. I am advanced enough in years to know I would prefer a youthful body to the one I bear, but I will not sell my soul."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil smiled and shook her head. "The path of knowledge is a path with a heart, the path of life. It will not imperil your soul, nor require you to make pacts with demons. But it will require your dedication if you wish to progress. But consider this: those beings with whom Cromwell had dealings have endangered his soul and yours. You are not safe until this matter is settled."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles' face became somber. "Your majesty, that thought does disquieten me. I would rather none of this had ever happened."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We can never go back to what might have been. Always we must start from where we are, and make the most of the situation in which we find ourselves. Each day is a new beginning, we rise from our dreams born anew. Never lose hope king Charles, for our disquiets can be dealt with as long as we have hope."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik clapped Charles on the shoulder causing him to stagger. "Don't worry lad, we've beaten gods and demons before. We won't let them get you. Shall we start for London?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 London wasn't really that far, especially when Enyil lead us through shadow. She led us out of the trees, across a field and down a country lane. A few shifts and we were entering the outskirts of a city. Armed men on horseback milled around the streets, but Enyil worked some sorcery, and they ignored us. We walked briefly down a cobbled street under a shower of rain, and then shifted back into typical London overcast. We shifted once more, and there ahead was the Tower of London, situated near the banks of the River Themes.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 In this age the tower was still a working prison, used to incarcerate political prisoners (read nobles) who were not in accord with the government of the day. Yeomen in bright red livery, with shiny breastplates, halberds and hats, marched around keeping guard.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Would they be Beefeaters?" Nalini asked, pronouncing it bee-feeters.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I believe the tower guards are known by that name." Charles replied.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Why are they called bee-feeters?" Prospero asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Because my predecessor Henry the eighth wanted to ensure that the Palace guards were big, strong and healthy. He assigned them a ration of beef to be eaten every day, hence the name "beef eaters". I believe that many of the poorer people still do not eat meat every day."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero laughed "And I thought it was some arcane term for special soldiers!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Well, they are, aren't they? They receive special rations!" Amrik countered.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0  We acted as tourists, and went sight seeing around London. King Charles seemed quite happy to act as tour guide, there were times when he seemed to take an almost boyish pleasure in being able to walk the streets of London unrecognized.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 London itself was quite different from the several Londons with which Nalini and I were familiar. This London had another twenty two years to wait before the great fire would destroy much of its heart. Many buildings had not yet been built. The houses of parliament and Big Ben did not exist; St. Paul's Cathedral was an old and rather ramshackle building, parts of which dated from Norman times. The city was a good deal smaller, and had not fully swallowed the once separate city of Westminster.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I made public comment on this, much to the dismay of Charles and Rupert. "You speak as if the future were an open book to you!" Charles complained.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Not quite, but where we come from, the civil war continued until 1649, when you were beheaded." Liz observed. Charles shuddered.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We've averted that" Nalini added "But unless you do something about the fire hazards around here, you'll find yourself living through the great fire in 1666."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then you must tell us what we should do to avert this tragedy." Charles asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You should clean up the rats first, because the fire is the only thing that stopped the Black Death." Liz commented.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini added "The plague is caused by dirt, and carried by fleas and rats. You'll have the plague in another eighteen years if you don't clean up the city."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Rupert and Charles looked at one another. "Cousin" Rupert observed "I think you would agree that London is much dirtier than Tarantia." We had agreed to dispense with any titles during our walk, but Rupert could not bring himself to call his king by his first name.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles surveyed the streets around. The one we strode was cobbled, but cross streets were muddy and rutted dirt. Garbage and refuse was piled everywhere, sometimes blocking smaller streets completely. People still discarded the contents of their chamber pots into the street, to the danger of passers by. Streets used by animal traffic were also strewn with droppings and urine. Rats scurried everywhere.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Prospero did comment on the need for cleanliness to prevent disease. If it be eighteen years away, think you we have time to avert it?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You have time, but measures must be introduced and strictly enforced. This city must become as clean as Tarantia if you wish to avoid the plague. The fire may be harder to avoid, for you must tear down many old buildings, widen streets to make gaps the fire cannot jump across. We're not experts on fire prevention, but we could come back in a few months and write up some guidelines."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 As we walked, we were heading toward some of the seedier areas. Liz asked "Is it safe for us to go there?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik laughed. "Lass, there are thieves and cutthroats in every city, but none would think to attack nine such as us. We are armed and dangerous, they would rather pick a man alone where the odds are in their favor."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We stopped off at a tavern nearby for a drink. Charles looked around with interest, and I gathered this was the first time he'd walked into a pub such as this. Silence descended as we entered, but the noise picked up again once people realized we were not after anyone. Amrik called out in heavy English "Ho! Ale for all of us!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero added "And two jugs of wine!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There weren't enough seats for all of us to sit together. Amrik selected one table that was mostly vacant, and sat beside two weasily looking men. He unslung his broadsword, pushed the blade partly out of the sheath, and laid in on the table with the hilt to his hand. "Don't mind me boys!" he said to the two unsavory characters.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 They looked at him, noted his bulging muscles, plus the fact that the rest of us were preparing to seat ourselves beside him. "It's all right, we'll move." They collected their beers and sat at a nearby table where there were three spare seats.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The others sat. There was room for six, or eight if we squeezed. but not nine. Nalini and I sat on a vacant bench at the next table. "'Ere! That seat's taken!" growled an evil looking character seated on the other side of the table. His hair was matted and unkempt, his face greasy, his beard strewn with relics from past meals. In true boys own adventure story tradition, his face was crossed by several scars. His body had the look of hard muscle now going to fat and drink. His three companions looked just as unsavory.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The civilized part of me was ready to apologize and move on, except that there wasn't anywhere else to move, unless we ousted the two weasily people from their seats.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<I hate situations like this!>> I thought to Nalini.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<If it were just us two, we'd move. I hate this too.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Aloud I asked "What, the whole bench? There's room for four here. I don't see any tankards on this side."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You callin' me a liar?" He glared at me.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "No, but we'll just sit here until your friends return." I replied brightly with a confidence I did not really feel. "There might be other seats vacant by then." We sat, and turned partly to face our friends. Neither of us wanted to turn our backs on them completely. Both of us reached up almost in unison and loosened our swords for easy drawing. The two I was watching out of the corner of my eye seemed taken aback by our movements. I don't think they'd noticed the swords before, perhaps because they expected us to wear them at our waists.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini tossed a gold coin onto the table. "Here, we don't mean to inconvenience you. Buy yourselves a beer on us." Here voice had that unmistakable tone an English lady uses when speaking with those of the lower classes - one that expects instant obedience, one that brooks no nonsense, but at the same time is attempting to be fair and reasonable.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Two of his friends stared at the coin as if it were a snake about to strike. The third exclaimed an oath followed by "A painted woman! With a sword!" as if he had only just realized that Nalini had dark skin.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The first man looked at the two of us with an odd look on his face, then his hand flashed out and made the coin vanish. "Thankee your ladyship. Canst use yon sword?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Yes my good man, I most certainly can. I've killed quite a few men too."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I looked at him steadily, and nodded slowly, smiling a businesslike grimace. Nalini suddenly reached up and drew her sword in a practiced movement, one of those lightening draws designed to parry an opponent's sword while drawing, and remove the opponent's head in the same movement. She didn't follow through, there wasn't room here. Two of the men started belatedly. "As you boys can see, this sword has been used many times." She lowered it carefully, edge upwards, pointing across the table.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 One of the men who'd started licked his lips as if he were scared. The spokesman looked at the blade, nodded. A sword that's been used has little nicks and notches in the cutting edge. Nalini's has such telltale signs. "That's an unusual blade ma'am. What're those wavy lines along the edge?" I wouldn't say his tone was respectful, but it had changed in that direction, as if he'd decided we might just be dangerous.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It's to do with the tempering..." she looked at me.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "They pack the back of the blade in clay for its quenching, with only the edge sticking out. When they quench it, the edge cools rapidly, and becomes very hard, while the back cools more slowly, and has more spring. The wavy pattern is where the clay finished." I added. Nalini lifted her sword and sheathed it.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik called across the room in heavy English "It can take head from bull in one stroke. Good lady's weapon. Is too light for me. I like something bigger!" He waved his sheathed broadsword around in his left hand, making it seem light as a feather.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik's muscular bulk means he looms over people even when seated. The evil looking man gave Amrik an appraising glance, obviously deciding it was in his best interests to be friendly. "So we can see. I don't think our friends are coming. Feel free to use the seats."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Our wine and beer arrived. Amrik drank, made a face, but continued until he had drained his tankard. Prospero drank, then exclaimed "Faugh! The beer's warm!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Hah!" I laughed. "And the red wine is cold! Welcome to ye old English pub."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Prospero tested the wine, then looked stricken. "Tasteless food, warm beer, cold red wine! What else will they think of?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik patted his hand. "Drink your beer before it gets cold!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0  Our day was largely uneventful. Amrik was sure that some ruffians were following us around, attracted by the gold coin Nalini threw on the table as a promise of rich pickings. Our weapons however were a promise of a hard fight should they attack, and so nothing eventuated.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Somewhat later, walking along the Strand, the riverside street which connects London proper with Westminster, and where there were more well to do people, Charles was jostled by someone. Amrik spun and grabbed a small boy, hoisting him into the air by one arm. The boy screamed and kicked, but Amrik seemed impervious. "Charles, I believe this is your purse?" Clutched in the hand that Amrik held was a leather coin purse.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles patted his clothing, then exclaimed "Why, so it is! The little devil!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik retrieved the purse and handed it back. "He has three accomplices standing around us. Be prepared!" He indicated two men in their thirties and a slatternly looking woman approaching middle age. The woman was holding a grubby shawl around her shoulders, the two men were standing about three meters apart. The looked angry, but were obviously not wishing to tackle our numbers.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik handed the urchin to Enyil, then like a striking panther leapt and seized the two men. One drew a knife, but Amrik shifted his grip to the man's wrist, crushing it in steely fingers. The knife clattered loudly on the cobbles. Prospero grabbed the women as she started to run away. I took the second man's arm and twisted it into a lock, relieving Amrik of the trouble of trying to control the two single handedly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Your luck's run out lads." Amrik growled at the two men. "I should break your neck for trying to stab me" he twisted the man's wrist in emphasis, producing a grimace and a groan from his captive.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Spare us, yer lordship! Spare us!" the woman wailed, turning on tears. "We've sick children to feed, an' we can't get no work with the war an all!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I doubt you've done an honest days work in your lives!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles ventured "We should hand them over to the authorities!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "So we should, but then we'll just have to hang around while a judge hears our story." He turned back to the man he held, and shoved his face close. "Right! If I catch you trying this again I'll break your neck! Understand?" The man wouldn't have understood the Aquilonian, but the translation spell rendered the words into his own brand of English. He nodded wordlessly. Amrik released him. "Run!" The man took off like a startled rabbit.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik turned to the man I held, grasped him by the scruff of the neck, hoisted him from the ground, and shook him like a doll. Then he held the man's face close, repeated what he'd said to the other man, and dropped him onto the cobbles. The man sprang to his feet and ran off after his companion.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik turned to the woman Prospero held, and said "I don't usually hit women, but I you try your pick-pocketing on me again I'll knock all your teeth out! Is that clear?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Wha.. what about me boy?" she stammered.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik snorted. "He's too clumsy to be a thief. Have him taught an honest trade. Now be off with you!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 She wailed and retreated. Her two male companions sidled from the passers by to comfort her. Amrik turned to the boy, who was squirming and swearing at Enyil. "Im not scared of you, ya big bully!" he screamed at Amrik.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik chuckled, then became suddenly gruff. "No? Well maybe I should thrash you with my belt? Teach you proper respect for your elders and betters. The gods know your parents haven't taught you."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The kid turned sullen. He was probably no more than nine or ten. His face was grimy, his hair greasy and unkempt, and like his relatives, he smelled abominably.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil commented "I think he's been thrashed too often. It probably won't make much difference to him. Let me deal with him."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik raised an eyebrow, but smiled. "As you wish."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil turned to the sullen boy. "You have the manners of a toad, and you smell like a goat. We intend to put a stop to your career as a pickpocket and thief..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Cut his hands off, that will stop him stealing!" Amrik interjected. Charles gasped, Amrik winked at him. "Prospero, do you hold the lad's arms!" Prospero grabbed the boy's arms while Amrik drew his sword slowly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The boy's mother shrieked and threw herself at his feet imploringly. The boy turned suddenly pale. Enyil held up one hand "No, I think I'll just turn him into a toad!" She waved her hand in a flourish, and where the boy stood was a large and warty toad, about the size of a medium dog. "Boy, you will stay like that until you learn that it is wrong to steal. Woman!" she raised the weeping woman's chin. "It will wear off, but should he return to theivery, he will turn back into a toad, is that clear?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The woman stared in shock at the toad, then began to shriek. Exasperated, Enyil exclaimed "You shall join him!" The woman's form flickered, and in her place was another toad. Amrik stamped his foot as if to step on them, and the two toads fell over themselves getting out of the way of his boots.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles and Rupert were also standing there with shocked expressions on their faces. "How did you?..." Charles managed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Enyil smiled at him. "The same way I changed your appearance. It will wear off in a few hours, but in the meantime they will think they are toads. I will warrant they will not return to the trade of thief."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We continued on our way. When I looked behind us, the two men were standing near on the river side, staring at the two toads. With the current social attitudes about witchcraft, I doubted they would tell anyone what they had experienced.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We returned later that evening to Hampton Court palace, walking out of the woods at the same place where we had entered that morning. Two men at arms were stationed on the path near where we emerged. Charles and Rupert were now back in their original forms, and as soon as the men recognized the monarch, one balled out in the direction of the palace "Ho! They're back! The king has returned!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Rupert, be a good chap and find out what all the fuss is about!" Charles ordered.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh, there's been a right to-do here today, hasn't there Bill?" one of the men at arms replied.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That there has been, John" the other replied. "The uh... parliamentarians made a right fuss this morning. Some of 'em claimed the devil himself came to visit!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Doan surprise me! I reckon they be serving that there devil, an' not god" his companion observed. "Then they done realized yer majesty had disappeared, and they was buzzing around like flies round a piece of er.. dung, begin' your pardon lords and ladies..."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Charles tried to suppress a smile at this. "I see. Well we had best make our way to the palace, and investigate this matter."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 An honor guard met us partway to the palace, along with several obsequious courtiers, Durathror, Cromwell and a couple of other puritans. We exchanged greetings. Charles asked "Prince Durathror, I have heard reports that you have had an eventful day?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Yes, you could say that your majesty. We had some rather odd characters appear."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Odd!" Cromwell exclaimed. "I thought we English practiced the art of understatement. We had a dozen demons come to claim our souls! That is somewhat beyond odd I should think."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled. "True, but let us go inside, allow the king and his party to refresh themselves, and then we can brief them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He didn't seem at all disturbed, giving me the sneaking feeling that he or one of the other Viharani were behind what ever had happened today.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A little later we sat in the main dining hall, with plates of fruits and pastries, flasks of wine, water and carafs of steaming black coffee.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell began "We were here, having lunch, when a dozen demons appeared over by the sideboard. They were tall and hideous, having the grotesque aspect of part man, part insect."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror added "They were the orange sea-urchin creatures as Nalini calls them. Being spirits, they cannot harm us while we are flesh. So they took on the aspects as Cromwell described, spindly insectoid bodies, armored against our weapons."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell continued "They had hideous looking faces! All bristles, and jaws that projected like a wolf's, except that they were sideways!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror explained "They had semi human faces, but their jaws worked like those of insects, opening sideways rather than up and down. They sought to eat our flesh."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Would they not have stolen our souls as well?" "Cromwell demanded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "That they would have, once they had devoured our flesh. We" Durathror emphasized the 'we' "have signed no pact with them, they must first eat our flesh if they would have our souls. I am not so sure about you puritans, it may well be that in your dreams you signed a pact with them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Humph! We have been through this before. How would we know? Many of us can scare remember that we dreamed, let alone what we dreamed!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Yes, we have. But you do remember something of the dreams wherein they masqueraded as Jesus and his desciples, and caused you puritans to fawn upon them, and fall into error. Mayhap you signed a pact with them in return for earthly power such as you now have."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "How did you get rid of them?" Amrik asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What is to be done if they have signed a pact?" Charles asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror smiled. "The puritans showed their true mettle. Most fled and hid beneath the tables, several jumped through the window which is now boarded up, while a few like Cromwell stood their ground and defied them."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell looked grim. "Some of us attacked with swords and pistols, but to no avail. They ate several guards before prince Durathror bade them retreat. Then prince Durathror and I stood before them and cursed them by the mighty names of God, and bade them depart whence they came. That proved effective, for after some dispute, they became like smoke and vanished."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror nodded. "You did well to defy them, Lord Cromwell. But if you have signed a pact, then they will continue to return to enforce their pact, until they claim your soul, or until we defeat them utterly, and destroy the pact." Durathror sucked on his moustache for a moment, looking grim and thoughtful.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What are these name of God?" Charles asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh they are in the bible" Cromwell replied. "'Almighty Living God', 'The Lord of Hosts', 'God Most High' and several others. The English words did not work, but then prince Durathror repeated the original Hebrew words, and the Demons cringed. I repeated what Prince Durathror taught me: Yahweh Asher Yihweh, Adonai, El Hai Shadai... but I now forget the rest."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "If you can remember those, they will serve you well when next they attack."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But why is it that the name of Jesus was ineffective?" Cromwell asked. "Is it not written that at his name every knee shall bow? And in his name may his followers banish demons?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror wagged his eyebrows, shrugged. I commented "Perhaps that is the point - that power is for his true followers. Was there not the story on Acts of the Jewish brothers who were magi? They had some small magical powers, but when they tried to use the name of Jesus to cast out demons, the demons laughed and smote them?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell and several other puritans nodded. Durathror took up my point "Lord Cromwell, I do not wish to belabor the point, but over the past few years there is precious little you and your followers have done of which Jesus would approve. As it is said, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but it is still the road to hell. Unfortunately, this is the road you and your followers have walked."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There were stricken looks on several faces. Cromwell pursed his lips; I noticed his lower lip was trembling. He breathed deeply before he spoke. "Have we not turned aside from that road?" His voice sounded thick.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You have, but turning aside is not enough. It is a long hard road out of hell; if you would live, then you must walk that road."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then walk it we shall!" He seemed to be regaining his determination, though his lower lip still trembled.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It is a hard road, the devil will send forth his cohorts to drag you from it."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Think you they will?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik nodded. "Tis like any army under a general. You fought a battle, but you have not won the war. They will regroup and return stronger, and each time they are beaten, they will bring more force until they are utterly defeated, or they win."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What if they have signed a pact?" Charles persued.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then your majesty, even God will not defend them should Lucifer seek to enforce the pact." Durathror wagged his finger in the air. "If there is a pact, then we must seek it out and destroy it, or prove it null and void."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "But surely if we signed anything, we signed unknowingly, or under duress?" Cromwell protested. "That must render it null and void."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Cromwell" Imladril asked "If we brought someone before you who had signed a pact with the devil, would you be that lenient? Or would you condemn the man for the pact, regardless of the circumstances of the signing?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell frowned. "Hmm, I take your point your majesty. We would need much evidence to convince us that such a man did not willingly sign away his soul."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "And as you judge, so will God judge you." Durathror observed. "The fact that you cannot now remember signing would be a starting point, but we would need to accumulate evidence. Throwing yourselves on God's mercy may not be sufficient. By signing such a pact you have proved that you are spiritually worse than almost any condemned criminal."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I had an inkling now of where Durathror was leading. He needed to engender a complete change of heart in the puritans. These straight laced holy hypocrits would be severly compromised to realize they had behaved worse than almost everyone they had condemned at their witch trials.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You thought you were holy, incorruptible, God's own voice on earth." I raised my voice. "You should know that if you set yourselves up as examples to others, then God will use you as an example, and allow Satan to test you, as he tested Job." I paused for dramatic effect. "Job passed his test, you puritans have failed. Now you are reaping the consequences."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell looked downcast, both angry and sad at the same time. "We lacked compassion for those less righteous than ourselves. Our lack of compassion has now come back to haunt us."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "As has your persuit of righteousness. You know now that righteousness is not the path of salvation, it is the path of the old convenant." I drove home a point while Durathror nodded. "If you would be Christians, you must abandon the first covenant and righteousness, and adopt the second covenant. Follow the teachings of Jesus, and show compassion on your fellow man. Otherwise, you have signed your own decree of damnation through your righteousness."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was a tear in Cromwell's eye now. "We became like the pharisees." he said slowly, his voice quavery. "Satan used our righteousness to trick us. How ... how do we make amends?" He bit his lower lip to stop it quivering, and probably prevented a sob from escaping.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror responded "You must repudiate your pact, and your persuit of righteousness. You have made a start by cancelling the witch trials, and the persecutions, but you must make complete restitution of everything to everyone who has been wronged. You cannot bring the dead back to life, but you can pay blood money to their families. You must prove to God that you are worthy of salvation. That is the only way you could convince God to set aside any pact you have signed with Lucifer."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 It seemed to me that there were forty puritans hanging their heads in shame. Most looked embarrassed, the rest looked stricken and a little tearful. Cromwell sighed deeply, lifted his head and raised his voice. "It shall be done! My brethren, are you in agreement?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was an uncertain chorus of 'aye' from the puritans. Cromwell turned to look at each of them. "I said we would make complete restitution of all our wrong doings. All of us were deceived by Satan, and we behaved like the pharisees. Do you all agree that we will do all that is humanly possible to rectify this? Then may we through ourselves on God's mercy, and ask His forgiveness for our greivous sins. Are you in agreement?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The chorus was stronger. Matthew added "'Tis the mark of a true Christian, should he find himself fallen into sin or error, that he freely admit his failing, and do all he can to atone for his misdeeds. Any who do not agree are not Christian!" The others chorused their support.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Cromwell added "It seems that all of us may have inadvertently signed demonic pacts while we dreamed. Do you all repudiate any such pacts?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 This time the chorus was loud. Atoning for misdeeds might be one thing, requiring as yet unknown actions, but repudiating demonic pacts seemed easy and straightforward.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then it is agreed. We shall..." his voice faded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The room swam with rainbow light, the floor seemed to tilt, and things spun. At first I thought this might be another orchestration by Durathror, except that he called out "All of you, gather around me!" He leapt onto the table, a golden nimbus surrounding him. The other Viharani were similarly limned.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 My own shadow shifting senses told me we were no longer in the banquet hall in Hampton Court, but somewhere else, somewhere so distant through shadow that I could not even get a fix on Hampton Court. We were still seated at our tables, with the remnants of our meal there. We seemed o be in a huge dark cavern, lit by flickers of flame that floated in the air. The walls rippled and flowed as if their shape could not be fixed. The candelabra on our table began to flow like hot wax, melting into a flowing puddle on the table cloth.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The chair in which I was seated rocked, and its arms moved to wrap themselves around me. I struggled briefly before a thought popped into my mind <<Use Sorcery!>> The question was how. Unless you have learned a series of attacks and spells to counter them, you have to improvise. Most spells that Nalini and I have learned are associated with mandala or designs. We focus our attention on the appropriate mandala to activate the spell.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Something wet and slobbery began breathing behind my neck, and I reacted almost without thinking. The glyph that came to mind activates a fairly dangerous spell, one that turns things into sand. You don't want to use it near your friends unless you know exactly what you are doing.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 My dreaming senses knew that the chair had morphed into something that was attacking me, and that became the focus of my spell. There was a brief vortex of power, the chair gave way, and I collapsed onto the floor. I sprang to my feet. Nearby Amrik was cursing, and hacking his chair into a sodden gooey green mess. Others were locked in their own struggles. Nalini was sprawled on her back on a second pile of sand; she sprang to her feet as I moved to help her.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril, Iskandor and Durathror stood together on a table, formed into a circle holding hands. Their table was still a table from the dining hall at Hampton Court, and the area around them seemed to be normal. That area extended outward for perhaps five or six meters, outside that things oozed and dripped. Enyil and Ra'anor were moving amongst those trapped by their chairs, freeing them. Nalini hugged me briefly, then we moved to help king Charles. He had a dagger in his hand and was stabbing with it over his shoulder. The high back of his chair had grown a long face with a beak like a bird of prey, except that he king's dagger had found the beak, and drawn green blood. Nalini and I touched the chair briefly while activating the spell. The chair flickered, and crumbled into a pile of sand. We helped the king to his feet, and into the safe area.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The piles of sand did not stay like that for long. One transformed into congealing blood that flowed to the safe zone, and lapped about its perimeter. Another became a horde of small stinging insects that ran about. A third oozed wetly into a grotesque parody of a human, lumpen and misshapen, a single eye in its chest, three long multi-jointed arms ending in claws, and an elongated ribbed head that reminded me a little of the creature in the Alien films. It hissed and spat at us, but could not cross the boundary. The rest of us huddled inside the boundary.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Some of the floor turned into water, then a tall iceberg reared up. Its tip burst into blue flame that became butterflies at its ragged edges. The ice cracked into shards of glass that splintered everywhere. The slivers transformed into bright little eyes with legs that ran around and stared at us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A nearby table deformed into a small elephant like creature with a spiny tail, the cloth twisted and became a reptilian rider. Nothing would stay in one form. The elephant became four trees, while the reptile became bird that took flight with leathery wings. The trees became four armed orcs that screamed some battle cry and attacked. Fortunately they too were stopped at the edge of our safe zone.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Things oozed and dripped, things slithered and crawled, things flapped and hopped. Colored flames flared in different parts of the cavern. A swarm of glowing coals sank like a shower of meteroites. A wind howled into our cavern, and a spectral face appeared. It was really only sketched in, holes for eyes, holes here and there to suggest bone structure. It hovered a few meters distant and was probably easily as tall as a man. The face was so badly sketched that it might have been semi human, or it might have been bestial, we could not tell.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Even the substance of shadow seemed tissue thin here. A thousand thousand shadows swarmed close enough to touch, all of them filled with menace. Something horned and cloven hoofed chased its prey through woodland. The hunter caught it, and ripped its still living prey apart with its fangs. Then it seemed to notice us, moved its bloodied claws as if parting a curtain, and walked into our shadow. Behind it tattered shreds of our shadow swayed in a breeze, beyond which we could see the woodlands.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 In another shadow, hooded monks walked a dark cloister. Their leader drew a crooked dagger from his sleeve, and used it to slash twice in the air before him, forming a cross in a parody of a christian benediction. The shadows parted, and they strode into our shadow. The substance of shadow flapped like a torn curtain. The monks drew up before us. In each hood three glowing eyes swam, but there seemed to be nothing else in the hood.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Where are we?" Prospero asked for all of us. He and I were pushing a writhing table into the safe zone, where it solidified into something that looked like a bunch of half melted candles. Imladril placed her hands upon it and concentrated; it transformed into the solid wooden table it had once been. Ra'anor gestured to a group of cowering puritans to clamber onto the table.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Somewhere I would rather not be." Durathror stated grimly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Is this hell?" Cromwell asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Not quite, but a close approximation." Durathror responded. "This could well be somewhere near the Courts of Chaos. Should we escape from here, we would be weeks returning home, and every step would be fraught with danger. We have angered someone powerful."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I've heard mention of the Courts of Chaos." Amrik began. "What are they?" He shoved a third table into our little safe zone, where Imladril transformed it. She helped him settle it against the other two.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Our entire set of shadows is cast by the archetype of order and chaos." Imladril responded. "Think of a fishing net strung between two poles. Each opening in the net is like a shadow, a world we can visit. The two poles are the Courts of Order and the Courts of Chaos. They are the realms of god like beings. Order is fixed, stagnant, crystaline. Chaos is fluid, changable, like you see here."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The further wall fizzled and sputtered, and another shadow barged in. This one was much more like a conventional picture of hell: there were fires, and demonic figures roasting living beings over them. Their living fless was rotting, and worms and maggots swarmed through them.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Cromwell, these realms are responding to your thoughts!" Imladril admonished. Amrik and I dragged a forth table kicking and screaming into the safe zone. That seemed to be about all we could fit.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "How do we get out of here?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It took great power to bring us here, it will take similar power to escape. All the shadows we frequent are like a few squares in the middle of the net. Here is completely to one side."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Are we safe here?" someone asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There were perhaps thirty people crowded onto the tops of four large tables, which did not leave a lot of room.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "No, but we are not in any immediate danger. We will need help to escape though." Imladril responded. "Danny and Nalini, we might need what ever assistance your gems can provide."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 For Imladril to admit that meant she didn't think we had much chance of escaping. We needed somewhere to sit so we could attune ourselves to the gems, but there wasn't much space.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Iskandor was crawling on his hands and knees between everyone's feet. He touched my feet to gain my attention, then said telepathically <<Ready your gems, but do not activate them. Durathror would prefer not to attract the attention of certain beings right now.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I wondered what he was doing; as we watched he placed his hands on the gap between two table tops, and with a flicker there was no gap, just a seamless piece of wood. He proceeded to fuse all four table tops into one platform.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I hugged, and began the process of linking our minds. We have to take our attention off our surroundings, which isn't always safe.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Maggots from the human realms. Do not think your little bubble will save you." The voice was the howling of the wind. "I will add you to my collection. Come."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The floor of the cavern curled up to form a huge hand, and next thing our tables were raised on the palm of the hand. A black tarry substance dripped down towards us, only to be stopped by some invisible force. Seeing the gobbets suspended in mid air gave me a strong impression that somehow we were inside a glass bubble.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What is it you want?" Imladril asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Most of the other figures sloughed away into puddles of ooze that smoked and evaporated. The six monks and the horned thing remained, though their forms ran like water. One of the monks transformed into a huge hooded cobra, a second into a gorilla like creature with a horse's head and a human head, with the third its habit became dark feathers and its face a human mask with nothing behind it, the fourth sprouted many limbs and its body contracted to resemble a huge hairy spider, the fifth grew leathery wings, and a cloudy blue sky appeared inside its hood, while the sixth transformed into a beautiful naked boy with marble white skin, curly golden hair and a huge penis as thick as Amrik's forearm that dangled almost to the floor. The head of the penis was barbed, and something black and smoky dripped from the end. The horned one transformed into something resembling a minotaur with both breasts and a penis.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The pretty boy responded "Want? I shall ride each of the men, and split them open."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The minotaur added "And I shall ride the women, and split them with my weapon!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The pretty boy fingered his cock. "Ooh, and then I shall ride them from behind, just like the men!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Gorilla head added "I shall eat you alive, the choicest morsels, the eyes, the tongues, the teats, the testicles and clitorises."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Snake added "I shall flay you alive and wear your skins!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Feathered shaman added "But do not think you shall die, I will not permit that. Your blood shall be added to my castle of blood. See there it rises from the lake!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The images of hellfires blew away in the breeze, along with most of the cavern. We seemed to be traveling across a landscape of conical orange hills and eliptical blue depressions. From our vantage point we could see a large lake of scummy brown stuff off to our left. In the midst of the lake rose a castle like structure that was the color of fresh blood.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I had linked minds, and were now activating each of the links to our gems. One of the links seemed close, and we followed it. With a shock we both realized that the power link lead into the castle of blood.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Did you call us here?" Imladril asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was a pregnant pause, during which Nalini and I began syphoning power from the castle of blood, and pushing it down the other links.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Then you have no power over us!" Imladril responded. She gestured at pretty boy, and his form melted into a hideously ugly toad.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Here! You can't do that!" one of the figures cried.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I shunted power from all the other sources back into the castle of blood, and set our attention to disrupting what ever held it together. There was a dull thump and the castle began collapsing into a sticky puddle. All seven figures taunting us likewise melted into congealing puddles on the monstrous hand.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror gave a groan, and then our table lurched into another shadow. Someone gave a cheer, but Imladril warned "They were just the underlings. The real power will step in now."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We floated over a vast lake that might have been boiling mud or molten lava. Furnace like heat washed over us and the roiling surface burped foul smelling gasses at us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We shifted again, and a plane of white sand humped and shifted, forming sand castles of its own accord. Stars pulsated with colored light like Christmas lights. We hovered for perhaps five seconds before shifting again.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Striated sky as far as the eye could see, and scudding multicolored clouds beneath us. The wind was freezing, the air thin. We shifted again.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril caught Nalini and I, and pushed us into the circle she formed with Durathror and Iskandor. She began linking her mind with ours. It was an odd sensation, Nalini and I were almost one mind and one thought, and there was this other that was Imladril. Durathror's and Iskandor's minds floated in behind hers, but they seemed preoccupied. Between them they were levitating our platform and shifting us through shadow as fast as they could. The two men had little attention or power to spare.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril was coordinating local defenses. Her thoughts floated into our awareness. <<We need to tap into the power links of those gems. There might be sufficient power to save us.>> Unspoken behind it was a quiet sense of desperation. Without some form of help we were outgunned and it was only a matter of time before we succumbed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The gems were a brilliant presence in this sorcerous mind meld. On one level there were sixteen links to distant places of power, radiating out like spokes from a wheel to infinity. All sixteen links were active, and linked to Nalini and me. Within us there was the core that had saved us when the orange creatures had tried to destroy us. That core was shut tight like an oyster, giving little hint as to its nature. Except that the links merged with this core, and from there the power was somehow available to the two of us. The power could be put to use, and one use would be to cause the core to open.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Not that!>> Imladril cautioned, aware of our thoughts. <<We do not know what it is, but it banished the serpent, it could destroy all of us in the backlash.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<The power is there, sixteen links only. One links back to beneath the castle of blood.>> Neither Nalini nor I replied, but rather both of us together.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<So that was how you destroyed it and those creatures. That explains why the god has been tardy to act. It wanted to scope out our powers, and that display both freed us and warned it. Permit me to touch the links.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Without our permission, she would be case aside at best, and possibly injured or killed at worst. <<Go ahead.>> We sat back to watch what happened.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I were aware of our separate identities, but also aware of our completeness when together. Nalini is no other, no mere partner, she and I are one, two parts of a greater whole. We were aware of Imladril, Iskandor and Durathror as others, but the two of us were concerned with reconciling ourselves with that deep core that linked us. It was almost as if that core were our third half.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Somewhere in that locked core was a dark secret that explained what we are, and who we had been. The two of us have been reincarnating together over hundreds or even thousands of lives, often dying for each other. Our many lives have not been kind to us. Buried down there is the pain and utter devastation of so many deaths, the memories of other worse pains. What ever else there is, the core harbors something vast and cold and arrogant, almost completely indifferent to anything other than the two of us. The coldness and arrogance began to surface, in defiance of Imladril's order.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Or to use another analogy, the core began to open just a crack, enabling us to reach into the core in search of what we had once been. Whether that search is such a good idea we cannot say, but we have a strong desire to find out. Both of us are pulled to discover what we have been, to remember the long sequence of our lives, and somehow heal that deep, dark pain. In its pain the cold vastness was indifferent to everyone on our platform, but would take drastic action if either Nalini or I were threatened at that deep level.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril tapped into several links, and the power flowed out into Durathror and Iskandor. The distance of each shift increased remarkably, and we marveled at the abilities of the Viharani. We were also aware of whatever they were aware of; including a flock of dark flying things that followed us through shadow, and was gaining on us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<The god has shot his bolt when he dragged us into his realm.>> Imladril explained. <<He stepped directly into the shadows in full manifestation. He acted outside the rules, and has alerted both the eagle and the serpent. He dare not act again like that, he faces banishment such as you inflicted on the serpent. Those dark things following us are as much as he may manifest in the shadows, and he knows now that we have power to destroy his creatures.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Can we defeat him?>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<With your gems we have a chance. Without them we lacked the power to break free from his realm. Do not mess with the core! It will save you, but could destroy the rest of us.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We had already reached that conclusion. Nalini and I, the new persona overlay, cared for our friends. The core did not. The two of us snuggled together, and waited in readiness for the action to commence.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We fled for between twenty and thirty minutes, shifting every few seconds. This by itself was a testament to the power and skills of Durathror and Iskandor. Imladril commented <<They hope we will tire soon, then they will attack. If they leave it too long, we will tire.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The attack happened quite suddenly. We had just shifted into a shadow with tall mountains spreading out around us, and I do mean spreading. They flowed outwards something like waves, more mountains forming behind them. Pale red snow fell from a sky that resembled an ocean of blood. Seven misshapen black things materialized around us, and vomited gouts of black goo onto us. The black stuff hit our bubble, and spread over it, obscuring our view. Somehow it managed to block our shadow shifting senses as well, making it difficult to detect shadows.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril played with some power links and the black stuff flared into bright green flame, eye searingly bright. The goo vanished. Three of the black creatures careened into our bubble, spreading themselves over its surface. They had a similar effect to the black goo. Imladril tried again, but though the creatures burned, they did not vanish. Three more splattered against our bubble, and now we began to drift toward the ground.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The one remaining creature tried to rake us with a lightning bolt, but Nalini and I reacted almost without thought. We selected a link within the gems and the bolt's energy was sucked away harmlessly, to be stored back at whatever were the sources for these links. The god tried again, summoning power through his own power objects. Imladril thought <<Now comes the killing blow!>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril directed more power to what ever kept out bubble formed, but it seemed that the six creatures between them were sucking power from our bubble faster than it could be replaced. There is a limit to how much energy a human can channel before it burns out the channel. I had this incongruous flashback to an old Star Trek picture, with Scottie saying "Capt'n, the shields canna hold much longer! We're running oot of power!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<This isn't funny, we are running out of power.>> Imladril stated.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The bolt came with a tremendous concussion, but something terrible at the other end of the link we had activated sucked away most of the power, leaving the god nonplussed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<That blow should have been unstoppable.>> Imladril sounded relieved, as if hope was returning. <<He knows now he lacks the power to destroy us outright, and must slowly drain us instead. We cannot shift through shadow while those creatures obscure our sense of shadows. We must somehow destroy the master before those creatures break through our defenses.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Can gods be created and destroyed? There are tales, but none of us knows for sure. The body a god uses to manifest can be killed, but the god can simply manifest again. Experienced gods do not need to go through the whole birth and childhood thing, they simply assert themselves and manifest. A more effective process is to destroy the god's heart, effectively banishing him until he can create another, a process that can take hundreds or thousands of years. To destroy a god's heart would normally release enough power to devastate surrounding shadows more effectively than gigaton nuclear weapons. Even to kill a god is a task that requires much power. Nalini and I briefly entertained a thought of sailing into a vacuum to see if that would affect the creatures, or perhaps into some gravity well near a black hole and tearing them apart.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror's thoughts suddenly swam into focus. <<Steady on you two! We would all be destroyed before the creatures would be. They are torn from the primal chaos, only a lord or order or chaos can destroy them.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<And their master IS a lord of chaos.>> we responded sardonically. <<What hope have we got?>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<While we live we have hope!>> Durathror sounded confident. <<True, he is a god, but while he cannot be destroyed, he can be banished.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Doesn't that need our dagger, and the Eagle?>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Perhaps, perhaps not. First, can we open the links one by one to the maximum possible? Start with that one.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 In some odd way, several of the links were being channeled directly to Durathror. He showed us how to open the active link carefully. Since he was the conduit, he did not wish to ramp the power up beyond what he could handle. Already our platform was being buffeted from side to side by monstrous winds, and rocked by thunderous concussions.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 As the link was opened the buffeting wind suddenly died. <<Ha! I'll bet that hurt him! Now open that one.>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We opened a second and then a third link, stopping when Durathror began groaning in pain. Most of the power was being channeled through him, not us, but the back wash felt like electrified ants crawling and biting inside our bodies.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Beyond normal sight a right royal battle was being waged. Invisible forces struggled with one another, seeking to hold or overcome the opposing forces. To our sorcerous sight everything around was thunder and lightning, a tumult that threatened to leave us deafened, blinded and with all our nerves burned out. Swirling vortexes of power threatened to engulf us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I are not in Durathror's league, but even to us it was obvious that the god opposing us was more powerful. We hoped we had strength in numbers. Durathror had two links fully open, and a third partially opened. Imladril, Iskandor and then Enyil linked and channeled power from the gems, but only Imladril could handle a single link at full power, the other two shared one link and did not open that fully. We had opened other links, but only to a level that we could tolerate, which was much less than the Viharani. The pain that their channeling caused grew to be quite intense, as if we were being roasted over hot coals and electrocuted at the same time.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Normal eyes and ears detected nothing other than the buffeting that was a byproduct of our struggle, and the convulsive backlash the sorcerer channeling the power experienced.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 By now our platform was being slammed around the sky as if we were a ball being hit by a giant baseball bat. Many of us were sprawled on top of each other, and it was all Ra'anor could do to use her own sorcery to prevent us from being badly injured.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini and I shared a thought: we had to employ our dagger. Part of the problem was avoiding stabbing those around us. Neither of us could stand, but then as we were thrown on top of several puritans our joined hands touched the solid seeming wall of the bubble. There was a slight lull before the next buffet, we willed the dagger into our hands, and thrust it through the bubble.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 There was an electric shock as it passed through our bubble, then the blade penetrated the chaos creature on the outside. Numbing cold swam up our arms, freezing them solid, but somehow one of the power links surged, and a countering warmth shot back. For several long moments it was as if we gripped a live high voltage line, the agony was intense, but we could not let go. The chaos creature stabbed by our blade screamed an ululating cry of agony.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Something deep inside us said 'enough!'. I felt us change, Nalini into the woman with the Jaguar head, and myself into the man with the Eagle head. The change was heralded by a sense of bilocation, as if we were in two places at once, and then with a feeling of watery energy we shape shifted. The agony of the power flows faded. Then two power links opened fully, on in the gem in Nalini's ring, one in the gem in the hilt of my dagger. A tremendous jolt of energy seared the dagger blade and ran around the outside surface of the bubble. The pain was so intense we screamed, but by now we were no longer in control.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 What ever was in that energy burned into the chaos creatures, turning them all to black tarry gobbets that ran over the bubble and dropped off. Outside we saw a huge man with purple skin, almond yellow eyes and writhing snakes for hair. His face was contorted into a fierce grin.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror seized the moment and shifted us arrow like through a vortex of shadows that spun around us like a maelstrom. Nalini and I could sense his thoughts: he had no clear destination in mind other than getting away from this realm. It seemed an incredibly dangerous thing to do, there was no way he could know through which shadows we would pass, but we had to assume that somehow he was in control.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The vortex was accompanied by a screaming cacophony of noises, from a shrieking hurricane to battle cries, from the crash of surf to baby cries, from laughter to tears, while a myriad different scenes superimposed themselves, and faded into one another, twisting and spiraling madly.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Suddenly a blizzard of purplish snow struck, obscuring everything except for a small green steam engine traveling upside down that passed us. Those of us with shadow shifting senses knew we had almost stopped moving. The front of our platform struck soft sand and almost everyone pitched forward in a heap. The purple snow vanished to reveal the details of our surroundings. Durathror, Imladril and Iskandor were hovering in mid air, Nalini and I were standing with our feet on the table top, at an absurd angle, seemingly oblivious to the forces of gravity.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 At first site we had landed on the sandy beach of a tropical isle, but the resemblance ended after the first glance. Gravity appeared to be a local phenomena, fluctuating wildly over the matter of a few feet, and seemed to be perpendicular to the direction of surface, regardless of the angle of the surface. On our table top down was through the bottom of the table, at an odd angle to the ground. On the ground down varied with the slope of the ground, so Rupert could stand on the side of a mound at right angles to its surface. The ground itself did not stay fixed for more than five minutes at a time, it changed shape and levels as if it were a living thing, currently sleeping and twitching.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The sea varied between a calm millpond and raging surf smashing onto the shore, while its color rippled through the rainbow. One moment it was the color of yellow soft drink, with blood red foam, the next moment it was green sea with pale blue foam.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Trees sprang up, grew to maturity and died in a matter of hours. Even the grains of sand would grow little legs, walk around a bit, then settle down again to being grains of sand. Odd shapes drifted through the sky: rocks, city skyscrapers, a street full of cars and so on in some weird parody of clouds. Everything was chaotic, but an ordered sort of chaos.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We tried to find neighboring shadows, but there were none near by. Nothing was close enough to reach without prodigious effort, and even those were chaotic, twisting.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<He has isolated us.>> Durathror remarked to those of us that were linked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Where are we?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Near the edge of his realm, our environment is more regular here."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Is anyone hurt?" Imladril called out.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Badly shaken perhaps." Cromwell remarked, dusting himself off. "Have we escaped?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I think the fun is about to start." Amrik quipped, helping Charles to his feet. Then he drew his black broadsword, and walked over to us.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Friend Amrik, that will be of no avail against our foe."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What is he, Durathror?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Call him a god, but a new one, not the old ones. He has less power, but still he can shape shadow, and uncreate. I am not yet sure which one he is, but he has brought us to his realm, and blocked our escape. I can tell you that he is the one behind the puritans' schemes."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "So you really did traffic with demons." Charles stated sourly to Cromwell and Matthew.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The two puritans looked at one another, an unfathomable expression on their faces, then Cromwell asked "Why call him a god? Is he not a demon?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Think of him not as one of your Christian demons, but rather as one of the Greek or Roman gods. He is not rebellious, but a ruler in his own realm.:}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Is there anything we can do? Would prayer help?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Provided you pray to the right god" Durathror spat back "it will do no harm." Cromwell made a face.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 A purple skinned giant appeared out in the ocean, wading rapidly towards us. There were snakes for his hair, he had six arms, each one carrying a weapon, and he wore a necklace of human skulls and a short kilt of white fabric.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What happens now?" Charles asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I would say we fight." Prospero sighed, drawing his saber. "There is no where to run, and nowhere to hide."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror held up his hand. "It ends here. Either he destroys all of us, or maybe we can defeat him. If any of you feel you need to prepare yourselves for death, now would be a good time."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "By Mithras, Durathror, you are a bag of gloom!" Amrik complained. "Did we not defeat the Serpent itself? We will defeat this one too!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror suddenly laughed. "Friend Amrik, it will be a glorious fight! We have held his sorcery at bay, perhaps it will come down to skill with weapons. We will be outclassed, but there are more of us, perhaps we can defeat him." His thought continued <<Most of us will die trying, and even if we win, we will be trapped in this isolated shadow.>> He laughed again. "Prepare to fight!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Die in battle and we will have an honor guard to the afterlife!" Amrik responded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Now who's being gloomy?" Durathror shot back.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 It occurred to Nalini and I that this god probably had hundreds of thousands of years practice with weapons, and even if he was vulnerable, he would dance rings around all of us. "Is he vulnerable anywhere?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "He is immortal. But if you sever his head and keep the head separate his manifestation will perish, and if you can destroy his heart he will be banished for thousands of years. I would prefer to try talking our way out if we can."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The being stomped onto the shore, shrinking down to more human height, and made straight for us. He looked vaguely human, but his purple skin seen close up looked to be like a reptile's, only the scales were like amethysts. His mouth worked into something between a snarl and a smile. "You have lead me a merry dance! I'll give you that." His voice boomed over the crash of the waves, his teeth glittered like diamonds.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "What is it you want?" Durathror asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The creature laughed "I want many things, but what I desire from you is sport, and your eventual deaths."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Why did you capture us? What are we to you?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The god cocked his head. "Why, you interfered with my plans. For that you must die! But now I know you are powerful sorcerers, I will enjoy the game. Entertain me, and you shall die swiftly as a reward."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik moved away from the rest of us, circling around the god. Prospero moved in the opposite direction. Nalini and I drew our swords and followed Amrik. There didn't seem to be much else left for us to do. My dagger was in my left hand. Imladril asked "Who are you? We know you are a chaos lord, but that is all."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You do not know me?" The god drew himself up, bowed toward Imladril. "Pretty Lady, perhaps I shall save you till last. Give you a chance to be of service before I dispatch you. I am Brass, duke of chaos, and knight of swords."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Close up, he was about three meters tall, with the stocky muscleclature of a gorilla, enough to make Amrik look weedy by comparison. Brass stooped a little to peer at us. "Black birds of ill omen, sorcerers, swordsmen and six women, sorcerers or swordswomen all."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I don't suppose there is any way we could convince you to let us go?" Durathror asked.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Brass's face turned sly and cunning. "I doubt it. What could you possible offer me that I cannot take from you right now?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Friendship?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I need no friendship with maggots from the human realms." Brass laughed.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Durathror shrugged. "Well, it was worth a try."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Brass smiled, an expression full of rat cunning. "Perhaps if you were to leave all the women with me, I could let the rest of you go. They could keep me amused in other ways for a time."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Amrik muttered some curse under his breath. Durathror responded "They would die slowly and horribly while we watched, and then you would come for us. We gain nothing."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Oh, you would gain a few days of life. Isn't that what you mortals hold most dear?"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "There are worse fates than death!" Amrik spat back. "Either fight, or piss off! You wouldn't be the first god we've killed!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Ah, edged weapons. How delightfully primitive! I might see just how long you can beg for mercy."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Brass blurred into motion, attacking Amrik, and as he did the remnants of our tables flew at him. Two of his swords struck Amrik and sent him reeling, the table tops burst into flame, and Brass spun, slicing a hand from Prospero. His saber with his hand still gripping the hilt arced in the sunlight. Brass charged into the thick of us, scattering the Viharani and cutting a swathe through the puritans. Blood spurted and limbs flew. Gunshots rang out from Liz and Paula, but the bullets ricocheted from Brass' tough hide.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The sand suddenly sprang into the air and blanketed Brass. A second later the sand became water, and a grinning god reappeared, swinging six swords in a glittering net. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Prospero wrapping his belt about his forearm in an attempt to stop the bleeding. Amrik, Durathror and Iskandor all confronted Brass. Amrik was covered in blood. Nalini and I closed from the other direction.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Swords flashed, and Amrik's hand went flying. Durathror and Iskandor had some kind of shielding spell, and suffered no injury, though they went flying. Nalini and I had our own shield spells activated, powered by what ever force we could wring from our gems. Brass moved far too quickly for either of us, trying to cut our own hands off. His blades struck our shields and he howled. Obviously whatever shielding spell we'd managed was more powerful than he expected.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 He stepped back a pace, swung two swords idly behind him, slashing two puritans to ribbons in the process. Then he tossed his swords into the air, and caught them again. This time he held a black bladed sword in one hand. The blade seemed to drink the light, and silver runes writhed along its length. The hair on the back of my neck prickled, and we both felt a strong sense of deja vu.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<That's a chaos blade! Beware!>> Durathror cautioned. He seemed to think that it would cut through our shields like a hot knife through butter.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Brass paused long enough to look around, then sprang to the attack. Power arced around him while he swung his swords Nalini and I seemed immune to the power, but not the Viharani who scattered with yells of pain. However, there was no way I could move fast enough to parry: his black blade sizzled as it sliced through my shield spell, slid underneath my sword arm and bit deep into my right hand side. It wasn't so much the pain as the shock, but the sword stuck in my ribs, siphoning energy from me. I thought it chuckled obscenely as it drank. We both knew with sudden clarity that this was how the final death happened, that a chaos blade could drain the power from our very souls, and destroy them.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 In that bitter kiss we both knew this had happened before. The when and the what were locked inside our core. Nalini, linked to me, shared the thoughts and memories that floated up. A chaos blade had torn her from me once, back in the past so dim and distant that it was memories of memories of memories many times removed. But the ache, the black despair that welled up with that thought! Then I had thought I faced eternity without her, and had sought out the chaos blade myself rather than face that. To follow was an act of love, to be taken first was... bitter desolation. What ever had happened that time, something of us survived. We couldn't be here with these memories unless we had survived. What, or how we survived, neither of us know.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I have braved the fires of hell for you!" that thought floated free from the depths, blazing forth with an intensity that shook us to our core. It had taken eons to find one another again. Desolate eons. But no power in the universe could keep us separate. In that lay the source of our own power.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 All these memories happened in a few split seconds.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Inside us something flared, bright like a supernova, and hard like a diamond. The core within us opened, that vast, cold nameless entity struggled up from the depths within us, pushing us to one side and taking control. My own sword was falling from nerveless fingers. Nalini had one arm about me, supporting me. We both knew I was about to die, my soul destroyed. The jeweled dagger was suddenly in her other hand. Everything seemed to kick into slow motion.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini screams, high and ragged "Never again!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Brass starting in surprise, shaking his chaos blade to free it from my flesh. Another of his blades tries to slash off Nalini's hand, but the dagger draws the sword to it, and as they strike the sword shatters like glass.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "No!" Brass springing backwards, slicing with his chaos blade as he tried to draw it free. Surely I cannot live more than a few moments, I cannot feel my body any more, I am a disembodied spirit watching. Brass's face registers shock and surprise, as if he realizes what is happening.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "NEVER AGAIN!!!!!" Nalini's voice, but now so loud the ground shakes. She swings the dagger at Brass. The Chaos blade meets the Eagle's dagger and screams like a woman. Brass gags with pain, mouth open like a beached fish.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Brass, releasing his chaos blade in desperation, and springing backwards in a prodigious leap, but all in slow motion. Nalini, jaguar swift, striking forward, the dagger seeming to leap into Brass' chest like a bullet.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "NO! NO! No! No! no! no!" Brass' chest falls open where the dagger pierced it, leaving something yellow and heart shaped visible that pulses with light. My own left hand springs forward of its own accord and grasps his heart, my claws tearing it from his chest. Well being surges through me. My right swings up to grasp the hilt of the chaos blade, and I draw it from my body. I will myself whole and well.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Give it back to me!" Brass is on his knees, no longer able to stand, his body melting like wax too close to a fire.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Would you prefer the chaos blade?" The tip of his chaos blade pricked his throat. "You would die the final death." Nalini and I spoke as one.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "All your friends would die" he gasped. "Have mercy!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "You would show no mercy, you would use your chaos blade to make us die the final death!" we began, but Imladril's thoughts intruded.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<We are wasting time! The others are dying!>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "Know that the final death is not final. We survived once before." The toe of my right foot pushed him away from the blade. Hope gleamed in his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<We must use the heart to heal the others now!>>}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Imladril could perform sorcery to heal quite severe injuries, but it required time, and most would die while she healed a few. With the god's heart we could will the others whole. Nalini and I held the heart in our left hands, and slowly surveyed the scene, willing everyone to be healed and whole. Amrik sat in a sodden bloody heap, his bowels held in his one remaining hand, a look of agony on his face. Prospero sat nearby, his face white, bright blood oozing from the stump of his right hand; Paula moving to comfort him, a look of shock on her face. Liz in tears, blood everywhere, Rupert's headless body cradled in her arms, still spurting. Charles hunched over, blood and entrails spilling between his hands, Cromwell supporting him with one arm, the other lopped at the elbow and spurting blood where it. Durathror crouching on the ground, both eyes burned from his head. Several puritans in bits scattered over the bloody sand.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Whole and healed, the mess cleaned up, everyone except Brass back in one piece. Reality rippled, and it was so. Such is the power of a god's heart.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Shock draining away from others' faces, and disbelief replacing it. Had it all been just a nasty dream? Durathror sprang to his feet, snatched the chaos blade from my fingers. Brass was now a spreading puddle, with just part of his torso and head still more or less as it was. Durathror pressed the point of the chaos blade into Brass' neck.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "One more thing, lord Brass. Pray tell us how we get home."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Brass glared and growled.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "I'll use the blade on you. I know how to use it. Choose. The final death, or tell us how to go home, and your manifestation dies. You'll be back before you know it!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 His eyes had melted and run down his cheeks, his jaw and mouth were deformed. He managed to grate "Use the heart. Ask them." His head turned toward Nalini and myself, still in our other forms. "Had I known who you were...." His jaw melted and dripped onto his chest. By a last act of will, he continued <<I would never have meddled. Are you really whom you seem? You survived the final death, is that true?>>.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We are, though we still have trouble with our memories. It has taken eons to come this far." Who were we? He surely didn't think we were the Eagle and the Jaguar.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Then you bear me no grudge?>> His torso was almost gone, just shoulders and a blob for his head.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "We bear you no grudge, Brass. We ask that you do likewise."}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<I will hold no grudges then...>> His thoughts were fading out, his head half gone. <<Farewell...>> his final thought seemed to be a name, something like aranhir, but that doesn't ring any bells with either Nalini or myself.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 We could not relinquish these forms while we held the heart, for its powers would tear us to shreds. We had to get the others home. "Gather round, it's time to go!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Nalini nestled her jaguar head against my shoulder. In these forms we towered over everyone else. Hampton Court dining hall. All of us. We willed, and it was so.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 I staggered and fell against Nalini, who staggered and fell against Durathror. "You must destroy the heart now!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Yellow light pulsed between our fingers, staining everything around a sickly color. We sucked power from the heart, stood upright again. Several thoughts chased through our minds.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Why destroy the heart? With it in existence, the god could move to manifest again. All he had to do was to gain possession of his heart, and his doorway into shadows was open. If we threw it away, he could be back next week. Or it could be dropped into the deepest ocean, or sealed inside a dark cave, protected by religious fanatics, and it might take him centuries to reclaim his heart.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 The heart would also be a mighty temptation for mortals, it would grant the holder god like powers, as we had seen, including immortality. Of course, most mortals would be burned to ash should they try to touch it, but Brass could work through his heart and prevent that. Nalini and I were now demigods. We could use the heart to do much good in the world. Brass could not wrest it from our control without destroying it. Others less scrupulous would also try to wrest control of the object from us. But we would be superior, we would prevail, and become gods ourselves.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 <<Such powers would corrupt you, bit by bit, till you became like Brass. He is still there, still in contact with his heart, and trying to influence your thoughts.>> Durathror was still linked, as were Imladril and Iskandor.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 True, he was there. Slowly he would exert control, endeavoring to possess our bodies and make them his own. Exactly how this would work we were not sure, we weren't ordinary mortals.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 While these thoughts buzzed around the surface of our minds, deep below, something vast and cold made a decision. "Power must be earned, and built slowly. Gods must grow into being. Brass, you overstepped the bounds when you captured these and spirited them to your realm. Your heart is forfeit!"}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 Our hands contracted, squeezing the heart. It seemed to beat wildly beneath our fingers, then with a noise like thunder it splintered and glittery yellow shards ran through our fingers and onto the floor. Prospero stood nearby, a strange look on his face, flexing his right hand. Amrik stood beside him massaging his belly. Durathror rubbed his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs22\b0\i0 "It is finished!" We felt our bodies shifting, changing back into their normal forms. Everything spun suddenly, the vast cold being retreated to infinity, and we collapsed like rag dolls.}}
